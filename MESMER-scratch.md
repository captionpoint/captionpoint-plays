## MESMER:
You are warm; feel the heat! You are cold; feel the chill! 
Light as a feather! Pain is... gone! You are warm! You are cold! You are light as a feather! Mesmer is gone! 

---

## SARAH:
Frer--ay Jock-ays.. Frer--ay Jock-ays.. Door may voos. Door may voos. 
SONNY LET’S MOOOO TEENERS-- 

---

## BEN:
Ack.

---

## SARAH:
SONNY LET’S MOOO TEENERS... 

---

## BEN:
Ackkk!! 

---

## SARAH:
Ding! Deng! Dong! Ding! Deng! Dong! 

---

## BEN:
Ack! Ack! Ack!  Land sakes alive! 

---

## SARAH:
What is the matter, Uncle Ben!? 

---

## BEN:
So many things. What language is that?

---

## SARAH:
French. 

---

## BEN:
A miserable failure. 

---

## SARAH:
Uncle?! 

---

## BEN:
Not your French... This... this... experiment! It simply did not work! Where is my notebook?. 
Sarah! What on earth are you doing?! 

---

## SARAH:
The experiment is a miserable failure. Don’t you want it gone from sight? 

---

## BEN:
Oh, youth. In such a hurry to get it right. 

---

## SARAH:
I-- I don’t understand. Isn’t it a mistake?

---

## BEN:
Certainly, a mistake. 

---

## SARAH:
A really big mistake?

---

## BEN:
Yes. But it is also a set of clues. A chance to gain some knowledge. 

---

## SARAH:
Mistakes are annoying.    

---

## BEN:
Mistakes are essential! How am I going to learn anything, if I am not learning anything? 

---

## SARAH:
That does make a bit of sense. 

---

## BEN:
When I have a problem to solve, I observe and ask a question; then I make a hypothesis. 

---

## SARAH:
A what? 

---

## BEN:
A sort of educated guess-- or prediction, based on the clues-- as to what is going on. Then comes the fun part: the experiment. Sometimes it goes as expected. 

---

## SARAH:
And sometimes it does not. 

---

## BEN:
I think we’ve established that, thank you. Even still, we have some data, which can be analyzed and recorded to arrive at... a conclusion. 

---

## SARAH:
A conclusion? Like an end? 

---

## BEN:
An end-- and also a beginning. 

---

## SARAH:
The end is the beginning? That’s confusing. 

---

## BEN:
Think of experimenting as a circle. Not a line. 

---

## SARAH:
The beginning leads to the end... and then back to the beginning! I get it! But it’s hard to keep it going.

---

## BEN:
You’ll have to keep practicing. A clock chimes. Snap, Crackle and Pop! Time to leave already?! 

---

## SARAH:
Where are you off to, Uncle Ben?

---

## BEN:
Oh......France. 
---

## SARAH:
FRANCE!??!!! Theee France?! Like, France-EuropeFrance???  BEN That’s the one... 

---

## MOTHER:
Sarah!!. 

---

## SARAH:
Oh, Uncle Ben! Take me to France! 

---

## BEN:
Ah ha! Your mother calls. 

---

## MOTHER:
Time for your French lessons! 

---

## SARAH:
Oh la la! Will you see the latest fashions? 

---

## BEN:
No, no. Nothing like that. 

---

## MOTHER:
Sarah! 

---

## BEN:
Off you go! 

---

## SARAH:
What better way to learn French than in France? 

---

## BEN:
This is not the moment to accompany me. Paris is in a bit of a frenzy. 

---

## SARAH:
A frenzy? My favorite! Tell me more!     

---

## BEN:
It’s all because of a......Doctor Mesmer. 

---

## SARAH:
Doctor Mesmer? 

---

## BEN:
A supposed healer of some sort. The King of France has requested my help... “Ben Franklin will solve it... Ben Franklin knows everything... Why not send for Ben?” Because... Ben. Is. Exhausted. And I’ve got gout! But! The King needs my help. And I need his. 

---

## SARAH:
SO. MANY. QUESTIONS. First: Why do you need the King’s help? Second: What is gout? Third-- and, I just thought of this one-- WILL YOU TAKE ME TO FRANCE?! 

---

## BEN:
First: I need to ask the King to support the American revolution-- in short, we must have more money. Second: gout is a complex disease arising from a build-up of uric acid in the body. It takes hold of the big toe and awakens the sufferer from slumber with the feeling that his toe... ...is on fire! 

---

## SARAH:
And... the third question... about taking me to France? 
---

## BEN:
That’s a hard no. 

---

## SARAH:
Pleeeeeeease! 

---

## BEN:
Sarah. Really. You are too young. And too... 

---

## SARAH:
Too... not a boy? 

---

## BEN:
Something like that. 

---

## SARAH:
But that’s soooo unfair. 

---

## BEN:
It is. Yes. 

---

## MOTHER:
Sarah. This. Instant.

---

## BEN:
Run along! Your mother calls. And my dear sister is not to be trifled with. 

---

## SARAH:
I’m only learning a few French words for society. The tutor is also teaching me how to curtsey; when to smile and laugh. And when to keep silent. It’s all just for show. My brothers are allowed to attend real school. 

---

## BEN:
Hmm, well. France will wait for you. For now, stay curious, ask questions, make mistakes. And, above all, do not waste time. For time is what life is made of. 

---

## SARAH:
Fine! 

---

## BEN:
Phew. 

---

## SARAH:
Do not waste time? Do not waste time, you say? Well, then, I shall not. Not a single second.    


---

## MESMER:
Welcome to Dr. Mesmer’s amazing clinic, where your ailments will be vanquished, and your illnesses cured! Let us begin. Charles? 

---

## CHARLES:
Hmm? 


---

## MESMER:
Let us begin! 

---

## CHARLES:
Mmh! Mmmmhmm... He hums awkwardly. Close your eyes! 

---

## MESMER:
No! No! Eyes stay open, stare into my eyes. No, you don’t stare into my eyes, tell them to stare into my eyes...! 

---

## CHARLES:
Stare into my eyes! 

---

## MESMER:
No, my eyes! 

---

## CHARLES:
“My eyes.” That is what I said...? 

---

## MESMER:
My. Eyes. 

---

## CHARLES:
Ah! I should say “stare into your eyes”? 

---

## MESMER:
Yes! 

---

## CHARLES:
Stare into your eyes. 

---

## MESMER:
No, no! How do you stare into your own eyes?!? Never mind... start with the music! Now then. Stare into my eyes! Feel the extraordinary energy I have captured in my wand!  And which I am... now transferring... to you! Feel the power! You are cured! You are cured! You are cured! I am exhausted by my own brilliance! I must rest.

---

## CROWD:
I’ll give you 2 coins to cure me! 5 coins! 10 coins! 

---

## MESMER:
I will return!


---

## KING:
What’s all the racket! Who’s at the palace doors in the middle of the night? Wait a minute. I am the king. I cannot answer the door. Servants? SERVANTS!!!!! Make it stop! Make it stop! Answer the door! 

---

## VOICE:
Docteur Sangsue and Docteur Laville to see King Louis the XV. 

---

## KING:
What’s all the fuss?! Couldn’t this have waited until morning? 

---

## DOCTOR 1:
This Doctor Mesmer continues to be a nuisance.

---

## DOCTOR 2:
He is stealing our patients. 

---

## DOCTOR 1:
And our patients’ money. 

---

## DOCTOR 2:
And, therefore, our money. 

---

## KING:
Hmm. The patients are going to Mesmer for a cure... 

---

## DOCTOR 1:
Even though we have brilliant treatments... 

---

## DOCTOR 2:
Treatments like leeches! Did you bring the leeches? 

---

## KING:
What do they do exactly... the leeches? 

---

## DOCTOR 1:
They suck out the bad blood... 

---

## KING:
Ick. That doesn’t sound so fun. And what does Mesmer do? 

---

## DOCTOR 2:
He uses a magic wand. 

---

## KING:
A magic wand? That’s it? Patients pay Mesmer and not the doctors... The doctors have less money, and so, I have less money.

KING, DOCTOR 1 & DOCTOR 2 Taxes!   

---

## KING:
I must go and count my gold. I like to check on it, make sure all the piles are equal, and look at my little, tiny face on every single coin! Did you know that? My face is on every coin! 

---

## SERVANT:
      Docteur Tardé to see the king! 

---

## DOCTOR 1:
Finally! 

---

## DOCTOR 3:
Am I late? 

---

## DOCTOR 2:
Yes, but never mind. Do you have the leeches? 

---

## DOCTOR 3:
Oops! I knew I was forgetting something! 

---

## DOCTOR 2:
That guy! Always a day late and a leech short! 

---

## DOCTOR 1:
What a jerk.

---

## DOCTOR 1:
The patients say they are cured. 

---

## DOCTOR 2:
But they cannot actually be cured! 

---

## DOCTOR 1:
They say they feel better.

---

## DOCTOR 2:
But they cannot possibly feel better! 

---

## DOCTOR 1:
Mesmer says he is a doctor... 

---

## DOCTOR 2:
But he is just a quack! 

SFX : Quack! Quack! 

---

## KING:
Pay no mind, my wife keeps ducks. 

---

## DOCTOR 1:
You said you would investigate! 

---

## DOCTOR 2:
Interrogate! 

---

## DOCTORS:
1 & 2 You said you would do something! 

SFX: FOG SIREN

---

## KING:
Help is on the way! 

---

## BEN:
And let me tell you about the lightening rod! And the electrostatic machine! Have you heard the one about the kite and key? 

---

## CROWD:
1-2-3 Ma chère papa! Ma chère papa!     

---

## BEN:
And this... ...is a little invention called the “double-spectacle”! 

---

## CROWD:
1-2-3 Ooh la la! 

---

## BEN:
Thank you! Thank you very much! I must go to meet the King! 

---

## STEWARD:
Monsieur, Monsieur! Votre coffre! Your trunk! Mon dieu, but it is heavy. 
Rats! Rats in the trunk! 

---

## SARAH:
Bonjour, France! I have arrived!  


---

## BEN:
Now, young lady. What in the name of gravity are you doing here dressed as a boy!?! 

---

## SARAH:
Being curious? Making a mistake? And, and... not wasting time! Just like you said! Remember? 

---

## BEN:
I meant play your music! Study your French, practice spinning the hoop! I did not mean follow-me-as-astowaway-to-France! My goodness! This is no place for a girl. This is... this is Paris! 

---

## SARAH:
Surely, there are girls here? Look! I see one! Two!! 

---

## BEN:
Does your mother know where you are? 

---

## SARAH:
I left a note. 

---

## BEN:
A note!? 

---

## SARAH:
Several notes? Then I fixed the trunk, so it wouldn’t lock. And when I got on board, I made friends with the cook. He made me the most wonderful suppers... 

---

## BEN:
And nobody stopped you? 

---

## SARAH:
Not dressed like a boy, they didn’t! I told anyone who asked that I was your grandson! People even wanted my autograph! 

---

## BEN:
And what is it you plan to do now? 

---

## SARAH:
My plan is to help you, Uncle Ben! With your experiments, your inventions, and now... with your investigation of Dr. Mesmer! 

---

## BEN:
I am leaving for the palace shortly. I cannot bring you with me... Can I? No, no, no... that will not work. 

---

## SARAH:
Why not? 

---

## BEN:
The negotiations with the king can be very tense. 

---

## SARAH:
Negotiations? What’s that? 

---

## BEN:
Discussions. Talks. Where both people want to get their own way. 

---

## SARAH:
Oh, I am very good at that.    

---

## BEN:
Hmm. That is very true. I must send word to your mother that you are safe! Oh dear, my sister is not going to be happy with either of us... ...not happy at all. Ben stops writing and takes a look at Sarah. You are rather convincing as a boy. 

---

## SARAH:
Perhaps I can be your assistant! 

---

## BEN:
You couldn’t possibly be my assistant. Perhaps you can be my valet. 

---

## SARAH:
Of course! Your valet! What’s a valet? 

---

## BEN:
It’s an assistant. 

---

## BEN:
I am due at the palace! This will have to work. 


---

## MESMER:
Welcome to Dr. Mesmer’s clinic, where your ailments will be vanquished and your illnesses cured! Let us begin. You are warm, feel the heat. You are cold, feel the chill. You are light as a feather 

---

## CHARLES:
Dr. Mesmer, Dr. Mesmer, 

---

## MESMER:
Charles, I’m in the middle of something. Ben 

---

## CHARLES:
Ben Franklin is here 

---

## MESMER:
What?? 

---

## CHARLES:
He has his wonderful invention the double spectacle - 

---

## MESMER:
Ben Franklin.. I will return. 

---

## CHARLES:
Wait! Dr. Mesmer, I got you a t-shirt! 

---

## MESMER:
Charles!

---

## SERVANT 1:
  Monsieur Benjamin Franklin! And his... ...petit valet...to see King Louis the XVI. 

---

## BEN:
Before we see the king, you should know, I am going to ask him to help us fight the revolution. 

---

## SARAH:
King Louis seems too fancy to fight. 

---

## BEN:
Much too fancy! But his gold will buy ammunition, food and supplies for our suffering soldiers. If I help the king with his mess... ...perhaps he will help us with ours. 

---

## SARAH:
This is heavenly! 

---

## SERVANT:
3 Croissant? 

---

## BEN:
Merci. Now to the business of the day... 

---

## SERVANT 2:
Profiterole? 

---

## BEN:
Ah! No, thank you. 

---

## SARAH:
Yum! 

---

## SERVANT 1:
Bon-bon. 

---

## SARAH:
Definitely! 

---

## BEN:
This is not really what a valet does... 

---

## SARAH:
I’m not really a valet! 

---

## KING:
Thank goodness you’ve arrived! I have a tremendous problem! 

---

## DOCTORS:
Down with Mesmer! Down with Mesmer! 

---

## KING:
You hear the doctors? They are so angry! I cannot go on like this! It is madness! 

---

## BEN:
Yes, I read your letter with interest. This Dr. Mesmer is quite intriguing. Even George Washington has mentioned him. 

---

## KING:
Intriguing? NON! It is intolerable! Fix it! Fix it!

---

## BEN:
I will help you. But you must also help us. May I sit? 

---

## KING:
Non! Walk with me... Now. Tell me! How is it going with the revolution? I think it is a splendid idea. Break away from that silly, old England! You can do it! 

---

## BEN:
We are doing our best. And very close to succeeding...but we do need your help with the fight. 

---

## KING:
Oh, I am much too fancy to fight. 

---

## BEN:
No, no. We need your help with the soldiers. They need supplies and ammunition. 

---

## SARAH:
They need food... 

---

## KING:
Let them eat cake! I heard that somewhere... it’s very catchy. 

---

## BEN:
Your highness...the situation is serious. 

---

## KING:
I get the feeling he’s about to ask me for money. 

---

## BEN:
I must ask you for money. 

---

## KING:
But I gave you mountains of money. Just last year! For the same revolution! It is the same revolution, yes? 

---

## BEN:
Yes. Turns out it’s very expensive to start a country. 
---

## KING:
Monsieur Franklin-- If this continues... I don’t know how I can help you. The people are paying Mesmer and not the doctors. And when they lose money, I lose money. 

---

## KING:
& BEN Taxes. 

---

## SARAH:
Seems like he has plenty of money. 

---

## KING:
My piles of money are shrinking daily! 

---

## KING:
Make it stop, Ben Franklin! Make it stoppppp! 

---

## BEN:
The problem seems clear: We must determine whether Mesmer is a legitimate healer or if he is simply a quack!  

SFX: QUACK, QUACK! 

---

## KING:
Pay no mind. My wife keeps ducks... 

---

## MARIE:
ANTOINETTE What I have seen!! 

---

## KING:
May I present my wife... Marie Antoinette aka Queen of France! Monsieur Franklin is here... ... for more gold... 

---

## BEN:
Oh, well, yes... but really we are asking for continued support of the revolution. 

---

## MARIE:
Revolution?! In France?! Impossible! 

---

## KING:
Non, non, non... the AMERICAN revolution!? Ha! The look on your face... Revolution...Non, non, it could never happen here! 

---

## MARIE:
Ah. Of course. American Revolution.You can do it! 

---

## KING:
And Monsieur Franklin is also here to help us with that pesky little Mesmer problem. 

---

## MARIE:
Pesky? Little? Problem? Non, non, non! Au contraire! Doctor Mesmer is thrilling! A savior! And quite tall.

---

## KING:
You see, this is what I’m talking about! It is a mania...! 

---

## MARIE:
Let me tell you what happened... I had a terrible headache... I have no idea what was causing it. There was a buzz all around Paris... Doctor Mesmer, Doctor Mesmer, Doctor Mesmer. Lady Champignon told Monsieur Mimolette... ...who spoke to Madame Frederic... ...who said something to Monsieur Arc-en-Ciel..Who divulged the details to moi! I simply could not believe what I was hearing. So I went to see Dr. Mesmer for myself. And I was... ...mesmerized!!! 

---

## MARIE:
Help me. 

---

## MESMER:
I cannot help you, shepherdess. I am resting and recharging... And you could never afford me. 

---

## MARIE:
But I am in pain! And I have brought this. 

---

## MESMER:
I suddenly feel... rested! And... recharged! Charles! Bring me my wand!

---

## CHARLES:
Your majesty! 

---

## MESMER:
Nien! 

---

## MARIE:
Ja! 

---

## MESMER:
It is an honor to serve the crown. 

---

## MARIE:
And just like that, he removed my head... ache. 

---

## KING:
And gave it to me. Oh, Monsieur Franklin, I hope you can get us out of this messy Mesmer mess! 

---

## BEN:
It all does seem rather outrageous. 

---

## KING:
Yikes! More angry doctors at the door! I will not rest until we have an answer! Like, literally, I will not be able to sleep. 

---

## BEN:
Leave it to me... Oooh! 

---

## SARAH:
Uncle? What is wrong? 

---

## BEN:
It’s the gout. 

---

## MARIE:
Dr. Mesmer can cure your illness! Yes! He can work wonders. 

---

## SARAH:
Do you think Mesmer has real power? 

---

## BEN:
I don’t think anything yet. That would be jumping to conclusions-- not very scientific at all! But I am starting to form a hypothesis... 

---

## SARAH:
Oh no, is that because of the gout? 

---

## BEN:
(small laugh) No, no.  A hypothesis is a sort of guess, remember? An educated guess at what might be occurring. From what we know, Mesmer’s techniques all sound a bit absurd: telling people to believe in a power that comes from a field of energy? I mean, really... 

---

## SARAH:
But, uncle, are you forgetting your kite and key experiment? 

---

## BEN:
How could I forget that one! Almost fried my hair. 

---

## SARAH:
We didn’t understand much about electricity until your experiment. 

---

## BEN:
True. 

---

## SARAH:
You had a problem to solve... 

---

## BEN:
How to harness electricity. 

---

## SARAH:
You had a hyper-thought! 

---

## BEN:
Hypothesis. 

---

## SARAH:
Right. Hypothesis. You did an experiment and collected data... 

---

## BEN:
In this experiment, I am attempting to harness electricity! To grab onto lightning from the heavens, by reaching up with a kite! 

---

## SARAH:
Oh, ho! Here it comes! The electrical charge is making its way to the metal key! 

---

## BEN:
Be careful! It’s pure power! 

---

## SARAH:
Conclusion?! 

---

## BEN:
The heavens are full of energy! Electricity can be harnessed from above! Seemingly out of nowhere... 

---

## SARAH:
A power is there. So how can you be certain Mesmer’s discovery is any different? How are we going to learn anything if we are not learning anything. 

---

## BEN:
That does make a bit of sense. We must give his method a fair shake. We must test it! 

---

## KING:
Well?!? 

---

## BEN:
We must consider the possibility that the wand may have some power. 

---

## KING:
What do you mean the wand may have some power? I thought you said, and I quote: “It all does sound rather outrageous.” 

---

## SARAH:
Tying a key to a kite and flying it in a lightning storm also sounds pretty outrageous. 

---

## KING:
Now that’s bananas! Who would ever do that?! 

---

## BEN:
Anyway, the point is. We must approach this problem scientifically. Ignore both the acolytes and the cynics. 

---

## SARAH:
Huh? 

---

## BEN:
The lovers and the haters. Shake it off, my dear. “The Scientific Method.”  The Scientific Method! It allow us to put aside our personal feelings and assumptions. First we establish the problem... 

---

## KING:
The problem is the doctors pounding on my door! 

---

## BEN:
That is a side-effect. Then make some observations! 

---

## KING:
I observe the angry doctors! 

---

## BEN:
Then we arrive at a question... 

---

## KING:
Will the doctors every stop being so angry? 

---

## BEN:
No...the question is: Can Mesmer actually cure patients with the wave of a wand? 

---

## SARAH:
Then we come up with a hyperthought-- 

---

## BEN:
Hypothesis-- 

---

## KING:
Hypothesis? 

---

## SARAH:
An educated guess. 

---

## BEN:
Then we do an experiment, collect and analyze the data... 

---

## SARAH:
...and form a conclusion! 

---

## KING:
That all sounds complicated. 

---

## SARAH:
That all sounds like fun! 

---

## BEN:
I will ask Mesmer to come to me. 

---

## SARAH:
To begin the experiment! 

---

## MESMER:
Me? Go to Franklin? Never! 

---

## CHARLES:
I thought you’d be thrilled to demonstrate your techniques. 

---

## MESMER:
Those beady little eyes, and those...those... mangled contraptions?! 

---

## CHARLES:
The double-spectacle! It is a wonderful invention by Monsieur Franklin himself! 

---

## MESMER:
Of course it is! Ben Franklin, Ben Franklin. It’s all about the Benjamins! He’s here, he’s there, he’s everywhere! Whyyyyy... 

---

## CHARLES:
Maybe it’s his brilliant mind? 

---

## MESMER:
Not helpful! 

---

## CHARLES:
He even invented your favorite instrument. The glass armonica! 

---

## MESMER:
Something stinks. 

---

## CHARLES:
Go to him.  

---

## MESMER:
Not a chance. But. If he came to me... observed my brilliance. On my terms. That might be... tolerable. 

---

## MESMER:
Sich sputen! Charles is confused and thinks he has crumbs on his clothing and wipes them off. 

---

## MESMER:
Nien! Geh mit Eile... Handle wie der Wind und fliege mit Eile von hier weg! Im Augenblick! 

---

## CHARLES:
I do enjoy a good waltz and absolutely love the sausages, but I’ve never mastered the German language. 

---

## MESMER:
Go tell him!!! 

---

## CHARLES:
You are formally invited to witness the brilliant techniques of Dr. Franz Mesmer at his clinic, Place Vendome, Paris! 

---

## SARAH:
Ah! Wonderful! 

---

## CHARLES:
Wonderful! 

---

## SARAH:
Marvelous! 

---

## CHARLES:
Marvelous! 

---

## BEN:
Alas, I cannot go! 

---

## CHARLES:
Cannot go! Wait-- why not? 

---

## SARAH:
Why not, Uncle!? 

---

## CHARLES:
Uncle?

---

## SARAH:
We have to see Dr. Mesmer! The experiment! 

---

## CHARLES:
Experiment? 

---

## BEN:
Yes, but his clinic is on a very bad road. 

---

## CHARLES:
Oh... 

---

## BEN:
Full of ruts and broken cobblestones! 

---

## CHARLES:
Cobblestones...this is true…

---

## BEN:
The carriage ride there would be harrowing. 
Have I mentioned the gout? 

---

## SARAH:
Oh, yes. You have. Several times. 

---

## BEN:
No, no. It is settled. Mesmer must come to me! 

---

## MESMER:
Absolutely not! Tell Franklin, he comes to me or we do not have a deal! 

---

## BEN:
He must come to me! 

---

## MESMER:
No! To me! 

---

## BEN:
No! To me! 

---

## MESMER:
No! To me! 

---

## BEN:
Non! A moi! 

---

## MESMER:
Nein! Für mich! 

---

## BEN:
No! Para mí! 

---

## MESMER:
Nee! Voor mij! 

---

## BEN:
Hapana kwa ajili yangu! 

---

## MESMER:
Watashi ni wa not! 

---

## BEN:
I don’t know any more languages! 

---

## KING:
Mesmer says he won’t go to Franklin. And Franklin says he can’t go to Mesmer... Mesmer and Franklin really are behaving like children. 

---

## MARIE:
Wait a moment! Franklin won’t go to Mesmer and Mesmer won’t go to Franklin. Why don’t they come to us? To the palace! 

---

## KING:
Ben Franklin and Dr. Mesmer here? At the palace? Oui! Oui! It is the perfect solution. 

---

## ENSEMBLE 1:
In this corner, wearing the purple waistcoat, hailing from Iznang, Germany and weighing in at 185 pounds. Franz. Messsssmerrrr! 

---

## ENSEMBLE 2:
And in this corner, wearing the green waistcoat, hailing from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and weighing in at two-hundred-and twenty pounds. Ben. Fraaaanklinnnn! 

---

## KING:
Mais non! 

---

## MARIE:
Ooh la la!!!! The match is about to begin!

---

## MESMER:
Feel... the warmth! 

---

## EVERYBODY:
Ohhh! 

---

## MESMER:
Feel... the cold! 

---

## EVERYBODY:
Ahhh!  

---

## MESMER:
FEEL. THE. BEAT!!!

## SARAH:
What is happening? 

---

## BEN:
I’m not entirely certain. Let’s continue to observe... 

---

## MESMER:
Look into my eyes! 
When I say, “Doctor” ; You say “Mesmer”; When I say, “You are”; you say “Cured!” CURED! CURED! CURED! CURED! 

I am exhausted by my own brilliance! 

---

## MARIE:
Bravo! Bra-vo! 

---

## BEN:
Fascinating! Extraordinary, Indeed! 

---

## KING:
Does he have powers? Are you convinced?!

---

## BEN:
Not in the least! 

---

## MARIE:
But... Monsieur Franklin... did you not say “fascinating”? 

---

## BEN:
I did! 

---

## CHARLES:
Did you not say “extraordinary”? 

---

## BEN:
Certainly, I did! 

---

## KING:
Did you not see scientific proof of people being cured? 

---

## BEN:
I did not. 

---

## SARAH:
What we witnessed was remarkable and thrilling... 

---

## BEN:
...but there is no proof that the wand was working... 

---

## SARAH:
...or not working... 

---

## BEN:
...and if the wand was working... 

---

## SARAH:
...we have no proof of what that working wand was! 

---

## EVERYONE:
What? / Huh? / I don’t get it. 

---

## BEN:
What we need is... 

---

## SARAH:
The Scientific Method! 

---

## BEN:
First, we observe the problem and ask a question!

---

## SARAH:
Does Dr. Mesmer’s magic wand really cure people? 

---

## BEN:
That is the “question” we are asking... 

---

## SARAH:
...the “problem” we are trying to solve. 

---

## BEN:
From what we can “observe” I am ready to make an educated guess, also known as a... 

---

## SARAH:
Hypothesis! 

---

## BEN:
Our hypothesis is... 

---

## SARAH:
If patients think they will be cured, then they will feel as if they are cured! 

---

## BEN:
Isn’t that the same thing as being cured? 

---

## SARAH:
Not at all. Dr. Mesmer’s power has nothing to do with the wand, and everything to do with people’s imaginations. 

---

## BEN:
I’m confused. 

---

## SARAH:
I’ll show you what I mean. Dr. Mesmer, will you see another patient? 

---

## MESMER:
Yes, yes... I can do this all day. 

---

## SARAH:
THE EXPERIMENT! 

---

## BEN:
My favorite part! I have a piece of equipment we will use to conduct this experiment. Voila! 

---

## MARIE:
A blindfold?  

---

## KING:
That’s it??? 

---

## BEN:
We will use this blindfold to cover the patient’s eyes. 

---

## SARAH:
Then we will collect some DATA and RESULTS and do some ANALYSIS! 

---

## BEN:
Do we have a volunteer to be mesmerized for science? 

---

## MARIE:
Oh, me, me, me!  I am the Queen, and I love science! 

---

## BEN:
Your majesty. Please mesmerize the patient! 

---

## MESMER:
No. 

---

## CHARLES:
Simply do what you usually do. 

---

## MESMER:
This is not how I do things! And you are not the boss of me, Ben Franklin. 

---

## KING:
But I am. Now...Mesmerize the patient! 

---

## MESMER:
Ahem… Feel the burning heat!  

---

## MARIE:
Yes! In my ear! It feels warm! It feels wonderful! 

---

## MESMER:
Um, do you still feel the warmth? 

---

## MARIE:
Yes! But now it’s wrapped around my ankle! It was sore but the energy is healing it! 

---

## MESMER:
Ahem. And now? 

---

## MARIE:
My tummy ache is cured! 

---

## MESMER:
This is ridiculous! 

---

## BEN:
“Dr. Mesmer,” please continue to mesmerize the patient! Feel the heat, your Majesty, as your are Mesmerized... 

---

## MARIE:
Ohhh la, la! 

---

## KING:


The-wand-was-pointed... here But-nothing-happened-and-then-the wand-was-pointed...there... And-nothing-happened!-But-when-thewand-was-not-pointed-ANYWHERE Voila! The-patient-felt-something but-there-was-nothing... 

AHA! Mesmer has no power! No power at all! He is an imposter! Arrest him! 

---

## BEN:
Not so fast, your Highness. There’s not necessarily a crime here. If Mesmer has zero power ... 

---

## MESMER:
C’mon, man. 

---

## BEN:
Then he’s done nothing wrong!

---

## SARAH:
Conclusion! 

---

## BEN:
One moment! We must do this all again! 

---

## SARAH:
But don’t we already have our conclusion?  

---

## BEN:
The more people we include in the experiment... 

---

## SARAH:
The better the experiment! 

---

## BEN:
Let’s gather more patients! Do you expect something to happen? 

---

## PATIENT 1:
Yes! It happened! 

---

## BEN:
Do you think something will happen? 

---

## PATIENT 2:
No. 

---

## PATIENT 2:
Meh. 

---

## BEN:
What do you expect? 

---

## PATIENT 3:
To be cured!  

---

## PATIENT 3:
I’m cured! 

---

## BEN:
What about you? 

---

## PATIENT 4:
I don’t expect to feel anything at all. 

Nothin’. Just like I thought.

---

## BEN:
The patients only feel something if they think they will! My– Our conclusion: 

---

## SARAH:
The imagination is an extremely powerful force! 

---

## BEN:
Even more so than I thought! The power is not in the wand. 

---

## BEN:
AND SARAH The power is in the mind! 

---

## BEN:
Thank you, everyone. This has been informative! Thank you, Dr. Mesmer.There, there! No crying necessary! We had a problem, we formed a hypothesis, we performed an experiment, and collected data and did some analysis. Then we delivered a conclusion! It is science in its purest form. 

---

## MESMER:
Science-schmience! I still say my method works! I wave the wand. People feel better. Why can’t that be enough? 

---

## SARAH:
A question for you doctors before we go…

---

## DOCTOR 1:
Yes? 

---

## DOCTOR 2:
What is it? 

---

## DOCTOR 3:
You tiny, little man. 

---

## SARAH:
Have you ever tested your leeches by putting them through the Scientific Method? 

---

## DOCTOR 1:
I have an idea: we shall use the Scientific Method... 

---

## DOCTOR 2:
Doctor, I’ve had have a wonderful idea to use the Scientific Method on the leeches-- 

---

## DOCTOR 3:
You know what I think would be good: to test the leeches using the Scientific Method... 

---

## KING:
This has been most helpful. 

---

## BEN:
Yes, it was quite enlightening. 

KING. Well, good-bye! 

---

## BEN:
Aren’t you forgetting something? 

---

## KING:
I don’t think so... 

---

## KING:
Oh! That... Of course. Would you like a small, medium, large, or... king-sized gold? 

---

## BEN:
King-sized, please. 

---

## KING:
Servants! One king-sized gold for Monsieur Franklin! Monsieur Franklin, this way... 

---

## BEN:
I’ll be right back. 

---

## KING:
I didn’t forget, but I was hoping he would! C’est la vie! 

---

## MARIE:
I think this belongs to you? 

---

## SARAH:
So you know I’m a girl. 

---

## MARIE:
Your secret is safe with me. 

---

## SARAH:
It’s hard to keep a secret. 

---

## MARIE:
But the wig helps! My wig allows me to be whomever I wish to be! 
---

## SARAH:
And mine turns me into someone else entirely. 

---

## MARIE:
Don’t be sad! You impressed everyone! You were a valet, Monsieur Franklin’s assistant, even a scientist using the scientific method! That’s wonderful, non? 

---

## SARAH:
Yes, but I had to wear boys’ clothes to do it. I had to be someone I’m not. When, really, I was the one with all the ideas! 

---

## MARIE:
It had nothing to do with the wig… 

---

## SARAH:
Or these clothes… 

---

## MARIE:
It has nothing to do with what is on the outside. 

---

## SARAH:
It was me the whole time… Sarah. 

---

## MARIE:
And Sarah is amazing. 

---

## MARIE:
I miss that cute Ben Franklin and his furry little hat and silly little spectacles. 

---

## KING:
He did get quite a bit of gold out of me. But, you’re right, he was adorable! 

---

## MARIE:
And what is that thing he said he was trying to do? 

---

## KING:
Build a country? 

---

## MARIE:
A government by the people? 

---

## KING:
And -- and-- --for the people...? 

---

## KING:
& MARIE It will never work!! 

---

## MESMER:
What is that music? Wait-- have I mesmerized myself? 

---

## CHARLES:
Dr. Mesmer! I followed you all the way to Switzerland! Oh wow, am I hungry! 

---

## MESMER:
Hmmm...looks like a wand... Mesmer waves it around. 
Acts like a wand... 

---

## CHARLES:
It is a wand!

---

## MESMER:
There are some people whom Ben Franklin and his science will never convince! Let’s go find them. Come, Charles, patients await!

---

## BEN:
Ahhhh! So good to be home. 

---

## SARAH:
Not really. France was so exciting! I got to conduct experiments. 

---

## BEN:
Your contributions were essential! 

---

## SARAH:
I got to say things, and people listened. Now I have to go back to... 

---

## MOTHER:
Sarah! Fireworks explode outside. 

---

## BEN:
But look! The war is coming to an end, and it’s the beginning of a new country... a new experiment... 

---

## SARAH:
Uncle Ben, do you hear me? I cannot go back to just doing what I’m told, sitting properly, holding my tea cup just so, not thinking for myself or even being myself! 

---

## MOTHER:
Time for your lessons! 

---

## BEN:
Dear sister-- Sarah is... busy... helping me. With an experiment. 

---

## MOTHER:
OK. 

---

## BEN:
OK? 

---

## MOTHER:
Just don’t let her hop the next boat to France. 

---

## BEN:
It’s a deal! 

---

## MOTHER:
And no lightening!! 

---

## SARAH:
Another experiment, Uncle Ben?!

---

## BEN:
Perhaps the greatest experiment of all!  

---

## BEN:
We are building a new country. The United States of America. One without a king or a queen. One built and run by the people-- 

---

## SARAH:
A country not run by a king or a queen -- is it possible?

---

## BEN:
I do not know. 

---

## SARAH:
You’ve written words and words and more words about this new country? How can you not know? 

---

## BEN:
If we’ve learned anything from Dr. Mesmer, my dear, it’s that the power was not in his wand, but in the imaginations of the people. 

---

## BEN:
A wand is just a wand! And a pen is just a pen. The power isn’t in my pen. 

---

## SARAH:
It’s in the people... 

---

## BEN:
In their hearts and minds. 

---

## SARAH:
The Con-sti-tu-tion. 

---

## BEN:
Yes, go ahead. Read the first line. 

---

## SARAH:
We the people...? 

---

## SARAH:
I’m a person, Uncle Ben. Am I in here? What about my mother? 

---

## BEN:
My dear sister... 

---

## SARAH:
Or… People who don’t look like... um...well… like you. 

---

## BEN:
I-- I don’t have an answer for that. 

---

## SARAH:
We all should be part of this experiment, Uncle Ben. Every single one of us. The more people we include in the experiment, the better the experiment will be! You said so yourself. 

---

## BEN:
What is your prediction? 

---

## SARAH:
You want to know my hypothesis-- about this whole United States of America experiment? 

---

## BEN:
Your ideas are essential. 

---

## SARAH:
I’m still observing... ... questioning. ...and I think this is just the beginning.
