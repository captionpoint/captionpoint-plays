## JACK:
What are you doing, Bella?
---

## BELLA:
Nothing at all, Jack. Enjoy your rest.
---

## JACK:
You are doing something, Bella. Tell me what it is.
---

## BELLA:
No, I will not tell you what it is.
---

## JACK:
Where have you sent the maid, Bella?
---

## BELLA:
Now, what makes you think I’ve done that?
---

## JACK:
I know Elizabeth’s footsteps. I know the sound of my own door.
---

## BELLA:
But do you know the sound of the bakery man’s bell? He’s just outside with his pushcart.
---

## BELLA:
I thought it would be a nice surprise to have sweet rolls with our tea.
---

## JACK:
That would be a very sweet surprise.
---

## BELLA:
Good.
---

## JACK:
Though I’d prefer oysters.
---

## BELLA:
Oysters?!
---

## JACK:
Did you know, Bella: on the Avenue, there are now two dozen pushcarts selling oysters. 

---

Packed in ice. Fresh from the bay.
---

## BELLA:
I had no idea you liked oysters, Jack.
---

## JACK:
Adventure, Bella! – That is what makes life worth living.
---

## BELLA:
Well, I’m sorry you don’t find my sweet rolls adventuresome enough.
---

## JACK:
It’s a nice thing you’ve thought of.
---

## BELLA:
And what’s more: I found your cuff links that had gone missing. Your favorite ones.
---

## JACK:
Found them where?
---

## BELLA:
In my desk, of all places.
---

## JACK:
Thank you.
Oh, the fire is in ashes. Could you ring the bell?
---

## BELLA:
But I’ve just sent Elizabeth out for the rolls.
---

## JACK:
Then ring for Nancy, the new one.
---

## BELLA:
I can do it myself! If it’s merely to put a piece of coal on the fire, I can do that easily!
---

## JACK:
Bella, why do you suppose I employ our two maids?
---

## BELLA:
To serve us, of course. But I think from time to time we should consider their feelings – in the same way we ask them to consider ours.
---

## JACK:
Do you think I don’t consider them?
---

## BELLA:
No, I’m not saying that –
---

## JACK:
Do I not consider Elizabeth to the tune of twenty-three dollars per year? And the young one, Nancy – at a rate of eleven dollars per year?
---

## JACK:
That’s nearly thirty-five dollars per year of my consideration. What’s the weather doing?
---

## BELLA:
The fog is awful. I’m sure you won’t want to venture out tonight. Come in, Nancy.
---

## NANCY:
What is it, ma’am?
---

## BELLA:
Your uniform. It needs pressing.
---

## NANCY:
Oh, yes. I’ll get right to that. I thought you rang the bell.
---

## JACK:
She did ring the bell.
---

## BELLA:
We need some coal. Some coal put on the fire.
---

## NANCY:
Like that piece of coal right there?
---

## BELLA:
Yes. That’s what we need. Right away.
---

## NANCY:
Yes. Indeed. Right away.
There we are.
---

## BELLA:
Thank you, Nancy.
---

## JACK:
And you might as well light the lamps.
---

## NANCY:
Right away, sir.
---

## BELLA:
Nancy, I wonder if you’ve learned to knit? It’s a fine hobby.
---

## NANCY:
I think I’ll take it up when I am much older.
---

## JACK:
You’re acting rather sassy today, Nancy. Like you have a delicious secret of some kind.
---

## NANCY:
No secrets at all.
---

## JACK:
Perhaps you’ve added another broken heart to your list.
---

## BELLA:
Jack, that’s enough.
---

## JACK:
I imagine that when you go out, you must leave a dozen boys in your wake.
---

## NANCY:
Will there be anything else, ma’am?
---

## JACK:
It must be those mysterious lotions you employ to keep your skin so lovely.
---

## JACK:
You know, Mrs. Manningham was a beauty pageant winner in her day. But in recent years, she has lost her radiance.
---

## JACK:
I wonder if you’d share your secrets with her.
---

## BELLA:
That will be all, Nancy.
---

## JACK:
Except for the sweet rolls my wife has so kindly ordered.
---

## NANCY:
Is Elizabeth getting those for you?
---

## JACK:
Yes, though I had hoped for oysters instead. Have you ever had an oyster?
---

## BELLA:
Please bring our rolls at once.
---

## NANCY:
Yes, ma’am.
---

## BELLA:
Why do you do that?
---

## JACK:
Do what?
---

## BELLA:
Humiliate me in front of the servants.
---

## JACK:
I was saving you from humiliation. You are too familiar with her.
---

## BELLA:
No, I certainly am not –
---

## JACK:
You say you want the servants treated as equals, so I ask the girl about her activities.
---

## JACK:
Then you say you don’t want to be her equal, but you won’t order her to manage the fire!
---

## BELLA:
That girl laughs at me, Jack! Every day she sneers at me behind my back.
---

## JACK:
What an imagination you have! That girl admires you.
---

## BELLA:
She most certainly does not.
---

## JACK:
Of course she does! She’s told me as much! But your imagination – the power of your busy mind – it blinds you to what is real. Bella…?
---

## JACK:
BELLA, BELLA… SMILE FOR YOUR FELLA…
---

## BELLA:
No, Jack…
---

## JACK:
BELLA, BELLA… SWEET AND DARLING ONE.
---

## BELLA:
It’s not going to work this time…
---

## JACK:
You really are a perfect little silly, you know that? You read dire meanings into everything.
---

## BELLA:
I do, don’t I?
---

## JACK:
I’ve just thought of something nice. Why don’t you come over here.
---

## BELLA:
Tell me.
---

## JACK:
I will tell you when you come over here.
---

## BELLA:
If I come over there, you’ll tell me the nice thing?
---

## JACK:
Yes, I will.
---

## BELLA:
I will come halfway.
---

## JACK:
Then I will only tell you half of it.
---

## JACK:
Now: I’ve just read that Mr. Booth – the celebrated actor – will tour to New York this season.
---

## BELLA:
Yes, I read that as well.
Oh, Jack…you don’t mean…?

---


Are you serious? You’d take me to see Edwin Booth on Broadway?!
---

## JACK:
Not only will we see Mr. Booth – but I will see that we are invited backstage.
---

## BELLA:
Oh, that’s a perfect heaven!
---

## JACK:
Now – the engagement is brief, so we must choose a night.
---

## BELLA:
You choose, Jack – any night! – any night at all!
---

## JACK:
You haven’t even asked what he is playing.
---

## BELLA:
It’s a tragedy, I bet. He is noted for tragedy. 

---

Oh, Jack – I’m so happy! – but what made you offer this? Is it because I’ve been better?
---

## BELLA:
I have been better, haven’t I?
---

## JACK:
Yes, you have.
---

## BELLA:
And you’ve been better, too.
---

## JACK:
What do you mean by that?
---

## BELLA:
This past week you have been so kind to me, so attentive. The ghastly dreams I was having – they seem to have vanished for good.
---

## JACK:
That means your medicine is working.
---

## BELLA:
No, it’s not the medicine! It is the serenity of a clear mind. I want you to understand that, Jack.
---

## JACK:
Don’t I seem to?
---

## BELLA:
Yes, but –
---

## JACK:
Haven’t I just said I’m taking you to the theatre?!
---

## BELLA:
Yes, you have! And you have made me so happy!

---


Come in!

---


Thank you – but not there, Nancy. We will have our sweet rolls on the table today.
---

## NANCY:
All right, then…here we are.
---

## BELLA:
Did you know, Nancy, that Mr. Manningham will be taking me to the theatre.
---

## NANCY:
Well, good for him.
---

## BELLA:
Tell me: if you were to see a play, would you wish for a comedy or a tragedy?
---

## NANCY:
I’d wish for a big ol’ bang-up musical. Lots of dancing – with maybe a dog act in the middle.
---

## BELLA:
We will be seeing the great Edwin Booth.
---

## NANCY:
Oh, the brother of the shooter.
---

## BELLA:
Mr. Booth is the greatest tragic actor in the world.
---

## NANCY:
But can he play the zither? Make a bird appear outta his mouth?
---

## BELLA:
How dare you –
---

## JACK:
Maybe the girl is right, Bella. Perhaps a musical would lighten your mind. There’s something here called Tita in Tibet.
---

## NANCY:
That might do it!
---

## BELLA:
Listen to me, both of you: I want a tragedy and I shall have one.
---

## JACK:
That will be all, Nancy.
---

## BELLA:
You’re right, Jack: I have been too familiar with her. From now on I will put my foot down.
---

## JACK:
Hear, hear! I must offer to take you to the theatre more often.
---

## BELLA:
Yes, you must! Now – let’s sit and enjoy our rolls. Here, at the perfect table for two. 

---

You on one side… And me on the other. There we are.
---

## BELLA:
What could be better? Oh, no…
---

## JACK:
Oysters! Look at that!
---

## BELLA:
…Jack, I’m going to be sick…
---

## JACK:
Oysters on the half-shell. You’re a sneaky little Pete, my darling!
---

## BELLA:
She did this. That conniving little Nancy did this!
---

## ELIZABETH:
I have your sweet rolls, ma’am.
---

## BELLA:
Set them here, Elizabeth.
---

## ELIZABETH:
What on earth?!
---

## BELLA:
And take those slimy things away!
---

## ELIZABETH:
Right away, ma’am.
---

## BELLA:
I can’t imagine how anyone could eat those things.
---

## JACK:
But that’s the trick, Bella. To imagine yourself as someone else. To don a character – like Mr. Booth does.
---

## BELLA:
You could have done that, Jack. I believe you could have been an actor of some renown.
---

## JACK:
Do you really think so?
---

## BELLA:
You are smart and charming. I’m sure you could persuade everyone that you are something you’re not.
---

## JACK:
That’s the goal, all right.
---

## BELLA:
And I would be there at the stage door every night – waiting amid the rush of your admirers.
---

## JACK:
Not every night!
---

## BELLA:
Absolutely – I’d be there to keep an eye on all those hussies who would be after you.
---

## JACK:
Oh, I didn’t know there would be hussies!
---

## BELLA:
I’m wise to all of them! – You will never escape from me! Oh – aren’t these rolls delicious?
---

## BELLA:
I know I am rambling on and on – but it’s because I’m happy. 

---

I can’t remember a time when I was so deliriously happy. Jack. Is something wrong?
---

## JACK:
Indeed there is.
---

## BELLA:
I think you’re joking with me.
---

## JACK:
Look there, at the wall.
---

## BELLA:
All right! – I am looking at the wall.
---

## JACK:
Don’t you see that something is missing?
---

## BELLA:
Oh, yes…the portrait.
---

## JACK:
The portrait of my father has been removed.
---

## BELLA:
Yes. Why is that?
---

## JACK:
Please retrieve it from where you have hidden it.
---

## BELLA:
I didn’t hide it.
---

## JACK:
You’re sure of that?
---

## BELLA:
Someone must have come in and moved it.
---

## JACK:
Someone other than you?
---

## BELLA:
Yes, of course.
---

## JACK:
Do you mean to say there are people in this house playing tricks on you?
---

## BELLA:
No – I didn’t say that –
---

## JACK:
It’s a simple question, Bella: where has the painting gone?
---

## BELLA:
I have no idea.
What more can I say? Do you want me to place my hand on a Bible and swear an oath?!
---

## JACK:
As you wish.
---

## BELLA:
No, Jack – you don’t need to call the servants in – we can solve this on our own –
---

## JACK:
Come in, Elizabeth. And please shut the door.
---

## ELIZABETH:
What is it, sir?
---

## JACK:
The painting of my father has been taken down.
---

## ELIZABETH:
So it has.
---

## JACK:
Was that portrait hanging in its place when you dusted the room this morning?
---

## ELIZABETH:
Yes, sir.
---

## JACK:
But now it is gone. Why is that?
---

## ELIZABETH:
I assume it is being cleaned, or perhaps re-framed.
---

## JACK:
You assume?
---

## ELIZABETH:
It’s your painting, sir. I expect you know where it is.
---

## JACK:
But I don’t, Elizabeth. It has been removed without my consent.
---

## ELIZABETH:
Perhaps there’s been a theft.
---

## JACK:
Nothing of the kind.
---

## ELIZABETH:
I should contact the police –
---

## JACK:
There is no need to involve the police. A painting has gone missing, and you claim to have no idea where it’s gone.
---

## ELIZABETH:
That’s correct.
---

## JACK:
Would you swear on it?
---

## ELIZABETH:
I have given you my word, sir.
---

## JACK:
Yes, I know. But my wife has said she would swear on the Holy Bible. Would you do the same?
---

## ELIZABETH:
I swear.
---

## JACK:
And would you kiss the Bible?
---

## JACK:
To settle the matter once and for all. Would you kiss the Bible as a sign of your truthfulness?
---

## ELIZABETH:
What has come over you, sir?!
---

## JACK:
I shall tell you, Elizabeth: I want the truth to be told in this home. Now, can you do that? Or are you lying to me?
---

## ELIZABETH:
No one dare call me a liar. Sir.
---

## JACK:
Thank you, Elizabeth. Please send Nancy in at once.
---

## BELLA:
Jack, please stop this. I will confess! I did it! I took down that portrait and I hid it away! There. Let that be the end of it –
---

## NANCY:
Elizabeth said you wanted me.
---

## JACK:
I’d like you to look at the wall behind you, Nancy. Do you notice anything missing?
---

## NANCY:
The painting is gone.
---

## JACK:
Yes.
---

## NANCY:
But I don’t know who’d want it. It’s awful.
---

## JACK:
I am not interested in your views on art, Nancy. I want to know if you took that portrait down from the wall.
---

## NANCY:
Did she accuse me of this?
---

## BELLA:
I did nothing of the kind.
---

## NANCY:
I never touched that painting.
---

## JACK:
I must have your solemn vow that you are telling the truth.
---

## NANCY:
I swear that I am.
---

## JACK:
And as further proof: I shall need you to kiss this Bible.
---

## NANCY:
Like that?
---

## JACK:
Thank you, Nancy. You may go.

---


Well, Bella – that settles it.
---

## BELLA:
Give me that Bible!
---

## JACK:
No – there’s no need –
---

## BELLA:
There! – I am kissing it! – Do you see?! – Are you happy now?! There is your evidence – there is your proof –
---

## JACK:
For God’s sake, Bella –
---

## BELLA:
I swear before Almighty God that I never touched that picture!
---

## JACK:
Then you are mad.
---

## BELLA:
What did you say?
---

## JACK:
You are mad, my darling – and you don’t know what you’ve done.
---

## BELLA:
No – Jack – don’t say that –
---

## JACK:
You poor thing.
---

## BELLA:
You promised.
---

## JACK:
You are mad like your mother before you.
---

## BELLA:
Promised you’d never say that again.
---

## JACK:
The time has come to face facts, Bella. I have done all that I can for you, but I’m not an expert – I’m not a doctor –
---

## BELLA:
But you are my husband!
---

## JACK:
– and because of that I am no longer equipped to care for you.
---

## BELLA:
Please, Jack – you must treat me with kindness. If I did take that picture down – I have no memory of it!
---

## JACK:
And the other items? My keys and cuff links and handkerchiefs –
---

## BELLA:
Yes! All those things! When they have gone missing – I did not know I had done it! 

---

These are innocent acts of mischief, nothing more!
---

## BELLA:
Let me try, Jack. I’m sure I can find the painting. It’s nothing that logic cannot solve.
---

## JACK:
Bella –
---

## BELLA:
Now: had it been taken out of the room, someone would have seen it come and go…so, it must be within these walls.
---

## JACK:
There’s no point in –
---

## BELLA:
It is rather large, so it can’t be in one of the drawers. It would be visible if placed under one of the chairs or tables.
---

## BELLA:
Thus, it would have to be placed vertically…it would have to be hidden… …here. And yes. Here it is! You see!
---

## JACK:
So you knew.
---

## BELLA:
No…
---

## JACK:
You knew all along.
---

## BELLA:
I reasoned it out! I used my own powers of logic. I did not hide it, Jack. I found it. There we are.
---

## BELLA:
Your beloved father looking down on us once again! All is back to normal. We are having our tea and our sweet rolls and everything is lovely.
---

## BELLA:
Won’t you sit with me? We can talk about the night we shall see Edwin Booth on Broadway. Jack? …Darling? …Where have you gone?
---

## JACK:
Only to get my coat. I have business to tend to.
---

## BELLA:
But why tonight? Can’t we –?
---

## JACK:
Here is your medicine.

---


And a blanket. For the chill in the room. Is there anything more you need?
---

## BELLA:
Jack…
---

## JACK:
I won’t be late.
---

## BELLA:
Be as late as you need. I’ll be fine.
---

## JACK:
Oh – I will be passing the grocer on my way. I might as well pay our bill. Where is it, dear? I gave you the grocery bill yesterday.
---

## BELLA:
Yes. It’s on my desk.

---


It should be right on top. I put it there this afternoon.
---

## JACK:
Are you sure it’s here? …I’m not seeing it… 

---

## BELLA: 
Yes, I’m sure it is there. Under the paperweight.
---

## JACK:
Perhaps you put it in one of the drawers?
---

## BELLA:
No – not in a drawer – it should be right on top –
---

## JACK:
It’s not here. Maybe you put it on my desk?
---

## BELLA:
No – I never go near your desk, you know that!
---

## JACK:
Calm yourself, Bella – you are getting excited –
---

## BELLA:
You are going to say I’ve taken it! Aren’t you?! You are going to accuse me of hiding the grocery bill – like you accuse me of everything else!
---

## JACK:
Please, Bella! Listen to me. I am worried about you. You need help. We both need help.
---

## BELLA:
Then we will help each other –
---

## JACK:
If only we could. But your fate is no longer in my hands. That power now belongs to the doctors at the asylum.
---

## BELLA:
What doctors?! I haven’t seen any doctors –
---

## JACK:
I’ve tried to convince them – but the doctors say I’ve been too lenient with you, too accommodating of your behavior. 

---

They may need to intervene.
---

## BELLA:
There must be something I can do.
---

## JACK:
Yes. While I am gone, you can find that bill from the grocer, and you can put it on my desk. Can you do that?
---

## BELLA:
And we are still going to the theatre, yes? We are going to see Mr. Booth on Broadway, and we will go backstage, and –
---

## JACK:
Oh, Bella. That will never happen now.
---

## ELIZABETH:
Madam! – I was knocking – 

---

## BELLA:
Not now, Elizabeth!
---

## ELIZABETH:
– There is someone here for you –
---

## BELLA:
– No – I couldn’t possibly see anyone –
---

## ELIZABETH:
Your hands – they are shaking so!
---

## BELLA:
My medicine – I must take my medicine –
---

## ELIZABETH:
No – no more of that – it’s not good for you –
---

## BELLA:
But Jack says –
---

## ELIZABETH:
– I don’t know why he’s making you take that.
---

## BELLA:
Because I am going mad, Elizabeth. That is the doctors’ diagnosis.
---

## ELIZABETH:
What doctors? You have not seen a single doctor!
---

## BELLA:
Jack’s going to have me committed.
---

## ELIZABETH:
No! I won’t listen to talk like that! Now: there is a gentleman at the door –
---

## BELLA:
Send him away –
---

## ELIZABETH:
– He is determined to see you.
---

## BELLA:
– No, I am not fit to be seen –
---

## ELIZABETH:
You are going to hold up, Madam – You are going to hold up and be strong –
---

## BELLA:
But Jack does not want me to have visitors –
---

## ELIZABETH:
That is not for your husband to decide! Listen to me: I will call this gentleman in and you will speak with him.
---

## BELLA:
But Elizabeth –
---

## ELIZABETH:
You must be brave!
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
The eyes – so vivid. The gaze so full of hunger.

---


I assume you knew the man depicted in that painting.
---

## BELLA:
No. That is my husband’s father. I never met him.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
You are Mrs. Manningham, I believe.
---

## BELLA:
Yes, but…
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
“Why” – you are rightly wondering – “is this age-ed carnival of a man standing in my home?!”
---

## BELLA:
You must be here to see my husband.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
The fact is: I am here to see you, and you alone. Might I just say: you are younger and more attractive than I could have imagined.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
I note that simply because it is a fact, and I am in the business of discovering facts.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
May I take off my coat?
---

## BELLA:
I believe you already have.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Well – look at that!
---

## BELLA:
Really – sir: you must say why you are here.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Oh, you are running ahead, Mrs. Manningham. I promise you: all will be answered in time. 

---

Please know you are perfectly safe with me.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
I’ve stationed your senior maid, Elizabeth, just outside the door. ELIZABETH – ARE YOU THERE? 

---

## ELIZABETH’S VOICE:
YES, SIR. RIGHT HERE.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
I’ve asked her to enter immediately should either of us so much as raise our voice.
---

## BELLA:
And yet you’ve not told me who you are.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Oh, just a plain police detective.
---

## BELLA:
Police?
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
And not one you would have heard of – since news of my exploits rarely traveled beyond Scotland Yard.
---

## BELLA:
Scotland Yard – in London?
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Had you been on my side of the Atlantic, you might have heard of the man who brought Sandham the Throttler to justice!
---

## BELLA:
That case was in the papers here!
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Well, Madam, you are looking at the man who gave Sandham the Throttler over to the authorities who throttled him! Rough is the name.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Sergeant Rough, Scotland Yard, twenty years in Her Majesty’s service. And now retired. I wonder if you’d agree to look into my eyes.
---

## BELLA:
But, why?
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Do you believe you are looking at someone to whom you can give your complete trust and faith?
---

## BELLA:
But you are a stranger to me.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
And you to me. Even still: in your eyes I see a woman who has traveled down a path of sorrow and doubt for a very long time.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
And in my eyes, I hope you’ll see a man who has come to help her.
---

## BELLA:
In what way?
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Mrs. Manningham, I told you I was in the business of discovering facts.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Well, here is another: by the look of things, I seem to have interrupted your tea.
---

## BELLA:
Oh – no – Jack and I were sitting here earlier – 

---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Just before he went out to his club?
---

## BELLA:
Yes. But how do you know that?
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
May I ask you something of the utmost importance?
---

## BELLA:
I suppose so, yes.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Would there be a bit of tea left for me?
---

## BELLA:
Oh, yes! – You must forgive my manners –
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
With a lump or two of sugar?
---

## BELLA:
– Of course – I’m sorry – I will call for Elizabeth –
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Oh, let’s not disturb the maid. We can do this on our own, can’t we?
---

## BELLA:
Yes! Of course we can! I will fetch you a clean cup.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
That’s splendid.
---

## BELLA:
Sergeant Rough, may I tell you something?
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Of course.
---

## BELLA:
I have never done this.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
And by this you mean?
---

## BELLA:
Been here, in this room. With a guest of my own.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Your husband would frown on that?
---

## BELLA:
I’m afraid so.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
And yet, he leaves you alone. Goes out to his club in the evenings.
---

## BELLA:
He has business dealings there. But how do you know that?
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
There is a leak, Mrs. Manningham. A leak in this house.
---

## BELLA:
I beg your pardon.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
I have in my employ a young man named Booker. This Mr. Booker fancies a young woman named Nancy – who I believe works for you as a maid.
---

## BELLA:
Yes, she does –
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Let me assure you that nothing happens in your house that Nancy does not tell Booker – and that Booker does not tell me.
---

## BELLA:
I knew it! I knew she talked about us! – And now that I have proof, I will have her dismissed at once!
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Oh, that is the last thing you should do! Before this night is out, I suspect Nancy will become a great ally of yours.
---

## BELLA:
What is this mystery? You seem determined to keep me in the dark!
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Because I am still quite in the dark myself! May I have just one more lump of sugar?

---


Now. This remarkable house: how did you find it?
---

## BELLA:
My husband found it.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
It must have cost him a pretty penny.
---

## BELLA:
It was my money, actually. As an only child, I had come into an inheritance.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
That’s a fine turn of events.
---

## BELLA:
In my case, no. My father died. My mother was sent away. My other relatives have stopped speaking to me.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
I’m sorry.
---

## BELLA:
But, my husband found this house, and he believed it would be a good investment.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
I’m sure he did. Tell me: when your husband is away, do you have free run of this house?
---

## BELLA:
Well, no – not the upper floor.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
When you say “upper floor”…?
---

## BELLA:
Above us here, on the second floor, are the bedrooms. But, above that, there is a third floor. It is locked up.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Why is that?
---

## BELLA:
When we first took the house, Jack said we wouldn’t need the upper floor. It is never used. For that reason – among others – I never go up there.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Who was it chose this house – you or your husband?
---

## BELLA:
Jack chose it.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
I see. And when, in fact, did you –?
---

## BELLA:
I hate this house. I always have.

---


Oh, that felt good. It felt so good to say that out loud.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
You implied there were other reasons you do not visit the upper floor.
---

## BELLA:
I’m not sure you will believe me.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
You would be amazed, Mrs. Manningham, at my capacity for belief.
---

## BELLA:
It’s when I am alone at night – like tonight…that I get the feeling that someone is walking around up there.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Have you told your husband this?
---

## BELLA:
No – he would blame it on my “overactive imagination.” But I hear noises nearly every night. Just around this time.
---

## BELLA:
And it is more than just footsteps – it is the sound of pounding and scraping, things being moved around.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Did it ever strike you, Mrs. Manningham, that it might be your own husband walking around up there?
---

## BELLA:
Yes. I had that very thought. I thought that maybe when Jack leaves this house in the evenings…he comes back here.
---

## BELLA:
And he enters the rooms on the upper floor. But how? And what is he doing up there?
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
What made you first think it was him?
---

## BELLA:
The light. The gas light. In this house, I can tell everything by the light of the gas. 

---

You see the lamps there. Right now they are burning full.
---

## BELLA:
But if an extra light was turned on – anywhere in the house – that flame would become smaller. And it would remain that way –
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
– until the other light was turned off!
---

## BELLA:
Yes!
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
– It’s a matter of pressure in the system –
---

## BELLA:
At first I tried to reason it out – rushing around to see if anyone had turned on a light in another room.
---

## BELLA:
But, then I began to realize…these lamps lower at the same time every night. Always about ten minutes after Jack leaves for his club.
---

## BELLA:
And that gave me the idea that it is Jack who enters those rooms on the upper floor – turns on the lights – and that is what makes these lamps grow dim.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Remarkable!
---

## BELLA:
And what’s more: I always know when he is coming home. Because when these gas lights brighten once again –
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
– that means he is finished upstairs!
---

## BELLA:
Yes! And not ten minutes later: I hear his key in the lock.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Mrs. Manningham, that is astounding!
---

## BELLA:
You don’t think I’m mad?
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
I think you would have made a fine detective!
---

## BELLA:
Certainly not! My mind is always playing tricks on me. Jack will give me things to look after, and then when he asks for them – they are gone.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
And they are never found?
---

## BELLA:
No – it is worse: they are found amid my things. In my closet, or my desk. And I have no memory of putting them there!
---

## BELLA:
Just tonight, the grocery bill went missing – and I have no idea why!
---

## BELLA:
I live forever now in a world of doubt – not knowing what’s real and what I have invented.
---

## BELLA:
Even now – even you, Sergeant Rough, standing before me in this room: are you really here? – 

---

Or have I invented you, as well? Are you only a dream?
---

## BELLA:
Has our entire conversation been nothing but a dream?!
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Be assured, Mrs. Manningham: you are wide awake. And I think you could do with a little medicine.
---

## BELLA:
I’ve had my medicine already. I detest it, but Jack makes me take it.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Oh, I am speaking of a different medicine. I may require a dose or two myself. 

---

Might you have two glasses? – Something like a tumbler would be best.
---

## BELLA:
Yes – of course – but –
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
The medicine I propose has been employed by humanity for ages.

---


One of its many cures is the temporary removal of dark fears and doubts.
---

## BELLA:
You are speaking of whiskey.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Good Scotch whiskey, Madam. Pure ambrosia. Liquid courage.

---


Just a small amount. Here we are –
---

## BELLA:
But I do not drink whiskey!
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
You underestimate yourself, Mrs. Manningham! You’ve no idea what you’re capable of. Not yet.

---


To health. And to courage.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
There. Was that so nasty?
---

## BELLA:
It was…not.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Good.
---

## BELLA:
Not nasty at all.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Excellent.
---

## BELLA:
In fact, I like it very much.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
I thought you might.
---

## BELLA:
Why have I never done this?
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
You’ll enjoy it even more if you are sitting down.
---

## BELLA:
Oh, that’s Jack’s chair. I would never sit in Jack’s chair.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Very well.

---


Now: I wonder if you ever heard of a woman named Alice Barlow?
---

## BELLA:
I don’t believe so.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Alice Barlow was an elderly widow who lived her whole life in New York City.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
She used her wealth to better the lives of the least of society’s members – the cabmen, the dock workers, the seamstresses.
---

## BELLA:
What a wonderful woman. And Sergeant Rough?
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Yes?
---

## BELLA:
Might I have little more?
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Alice Barlow knew there was a great deal of pain in the world…

---

but she believed her kindness to those less fortunate was a small contribution to the sum of the world’s happiness.
---

## BELLA:
And you knew her?
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
I had occasion to see her only once: 

---

That was the day her throat was cut and she lay dead on the floor of her home.
---

## BELLA:
Oh, how awful…
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
I saw that twenty-five years ago – and I have never forgotten it. I had left London and signed on with the New York police force.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
It was then, as a young officer, that I was assigned to the murder of Alice Barlow.
---

## BELLA:
But why was she killed?
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Alice Barlow had inherited what were known as the “Barlow rubies” – nine precious and priceless gems.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
It was well-known that she had hidden these rare gems somewhere in her home.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
When her body was discovered, only a few trinkets from the house had been taken – 

---

however the entire place had been turned upside-down, everything flung madly about.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
But the Barlow rubies were never found.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
The investigation determined that the killer – who was also never found – must have vanished with the priceless gems.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Years went by. I moved back to London. Caught on with Scotland Yard. But, I never stopped thinking about Alice Barlow.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
It was presumed she was killed after the robbery to assure her silence.
---

## BELLA:
But then how to explain the chaos inside the house?
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Exactly! I began to think: what if she was killed first? 

---

What if the only person who could have told this criminal where the rubies were hidden –
---

## BELLA:
– was the very woman he had just killed?!
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
YES!
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Can’t you picture it: the killer ransacking the place – growing more and more desperate – 

---

until he must finally escape empty-handed, leaving the blood and wreckage of the house behind?
---

## BELLA:
What became of the rubies?
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
I believe they are still waiting right where Alice Barlow hid them.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
And what’s more: I believe the killer of Alice Barlow never gave up trying to find those rubies in her home.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
That he waited for YEARS – and then circled back, renewing the search he began on that terrible night! 

---

THAT, Mrs. Manningham, is why I’ve come back.
---

## BELLA:
Come back?
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Don’t you see: I have been in this house before. I was standing right where you are now when I saw Alice Barlow lying dead on the floor.
---

## BELLA:
That can’t be true!
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
It all happened here. It was in this very room that I interviewed a young man named Sydney Power – who claimed to be a distant nephew.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
I spoke to young Mr. Power for only a few minutes, but I never forget a face.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
That is why just last week, as I walked down the street near this house, I was startled to see that very man – walking directly toward me.
---

## BELLA:
Twenty-five years later?
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
YES. And there was something more: there was a woman on his arm. That woman, Mrs. Manningham, was you.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
When I followed the two of you home, I was brought right back to the scene of the crime!
---

## BELLA:
No! – That’s impossible!
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Your husband is that man, Sydney Power! He murdered Alice Barlow in this house twenty-five years ago!
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Failing to find the Barlow rubies – he went abroad, waited years for the case to vanish from the news – and then he met you.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
With your money he gained access to this house. And having gained that, he renewed his search.
---

## BELLA:
Look at the lamps – Jack’s come back!
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
He is upstairs – searching once again!
---

## BELLA:
No, it can’t be –
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
And the lamps will brighten when he leaves the upper floor. That is perfect!
---

## BELLA:
Listen to me –
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
We shall know exactly how much time we have! The lamps shall be our warning.
---

## BELLA:
No more of your outlandish stories! YOU MUST LEAVE HERE AT ONCE!
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Every night this week I have watched your husband disappear into the alley – climb the fire escape to the roof – and enter the upper floor through a skylight.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Once there, he begins his nightly search – which you yourself have heard!
---

## BELLA:
But if that were true, I would surely find him out –
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Yes –
---

## BELLA:
– At some point I would catch him in the act!
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Unless he got rid of you. You are not going mad, Mrs. Manningham. You are slowly and systematically being driven out of your mind.
---

## BELLA:
No…
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
And once you are locked away in an asylum, Sydney Power can search this house with impunity!
---

## BELLA:
But that man is my husband!
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
That man is a rogue and a liar and a relentless creature of the night – haunting the Stage Doors for young actresses –
---

## BELLA:
ELIZABETH!
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
– prowling his way through the low resorts and shadows of the city.
---

## BELLA:
That’s not true – you are saying this to hurt me!
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
I am saying this to free you from obligation. Don’t you see: you hold all the power here. YOU ALONE can bring him down!
---

## ELIZABETH:
I’m here, ma’am! What is it?!

---


You called for me. What may I do for you?
---

## BELLA:
Nothing at all. I believe I can do this on my own.

---


What is it you need?
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
We need proof of his true identity. Evidence that links your Jack Manningham to my Sydney Power. Where does he keep his personal papers?
---

## BELLA:
That desk there – that is his –
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Excellent.
---

## BELLA:
But the main drawer, it is always locked.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Then we must have a look inside!
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Do you know: one of my great regrets is that I never became a professional burglar. I think it would have been a lovely occupation.
---

## BELLA:
Sergeant Rough –
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Working alone, with little tools, in a quiet room. Heavenly!
---

## BELLA:
– Jack will know we’ve gone through his things.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Not if we are clever. And there is nothing so clever as a key. Ha! – Not that one! Not that one, either! Would you mind if I took off my jacket?
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
I find I do my best work in my shirt sleeves. There we are. I bet you did not expect me to be wearing such a saucy shirt!
---

## BELLA:
Hurry, Sergeant Rough – he is just upstairs!
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
The keys have all failed us. I fear this lock will need to be picked.
---

## BELLA:
No – please –
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
And I will take great pleasure in that!
---

## BELLA:
The lamps! He is coming back! He is finished upstairs!
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
There is the warning we’ve been waiting for. Ring for Elizabeth at once.
---

## BELLA:
Jack will be here any moment.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Elizabeth: are you willing to help your mistress? Help her blindly – while asking no questions whatsoever?
---

## ELIZABETH:
Yes, sir. I am.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Good. Then, tell me this: if you were asked to hide an old police detective in your home, where would you put him?
---

## BELLA:
But you can’t hide in the house! – Jack will find you!
---

## ELIZABETH:
How about the Master’s wardrobe?
---

## BELLA:
But Jack uses that closet every night!
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Show it to me, at once.
---

## ELIZABETH:
It’s right here – through this door – it’s quite large. Goes all the way back.
---

## BELLA:
Elizabeth – this can’t be happening! I must be dreaming it.
---

## ELIZABETH:
Be strong, Ma’am. Listen to him, and do what he says –
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Perfect accommodation!

---


Now: we must remove all evidence of my presence. I shall get my coat and scarf. Do not forget our whiskey glasses –
---

## BELLA:
You must hide if you’re going to hide –
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
And my teacup, as well. Ah, yes. Here he comes! Right on time. You, Mrs. Manningham, must go upstairs this instant.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Elizabeth, you must invent something to tell your master.
---

## BELLA:
Tell him I had a headache and retired to my bed.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Yes! That’s perfect! And do not leave your room until I call for you. That is very important. Now – let’s turn down those lamps.
---

## BELLA:
But then what, Sergeant Rough? What is your plan?
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
There is no more plan! I’ve told you everything I know!
---

## BELLA:
That’s not enough!
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
It will have to be! You are up against the most awful moment of your life – and you must be STRONG.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Your entire future depends on what we do here in the next hour!
---

## BELLA:
I am trusting you, Sergeant Rough.
Hurry, Elizabeth. My husband is about to walk through that door.
---

## JACK:
Nancy! Elizabeth! – Where are you? Can you hear me?

---


Is no one here?!
---

---
---

## JACK:
Is no one here?!
---

## ELIZABETH:
Sir?
---

## JACK:
Elizabeth – there you are. I rang the bell.
---

## ELIZABETH:
I was seeing to Mrs. Manningham. She’s gone to bed with a terrible headache.
---

## JACK:
Is that so?
---

## ELIZABETH:
Yes, sir.
---

## JACK:
Then we will need to be quiet as cats. Can you do that, Elizabeth? Can you sneak about as quietly as a cat?
---

## ELIZABETH:
Well – I’m not sure, really.
---

## JACK:
Perhaps a little kitty-cat should have already cleared away our tea.
---

## ELIZABETH:
Oh, I was just about to do that, sir.
What would you like for supper?
---

## JACK:
I will have my supper out tonight. I’ve only come home to change my collar.
---

## ELIZABETH:
Should I get you a fresh one, sir? From your closet.
---

## JACK:
I think I am capable of doing that.
---

## ELIZABETH:
But it would be my pleasure! Why don’t you sit for a minute and I will –
---

## JACK:
Do you know the sort of collar I want to wear tonight?
---

## ELIZABETH:
Why, yes – I think I do!
---

## JACK:
You are a mind-reader then! I shall have to watch myself around you.
There we are. Is something wrong?
---

## ELIZABETH:
Oh, no, sir. Not at all.
---

## JACK:
Tell me, Elizabeth: what did you think of Mrs. Manningham tonight?
---

## ELIZABETH:
She seemed…unwell.
---

## JACK:
I doubt you can imagine how unwell she truly is. Just between us: I’m at my wit’s end.
---

## JACK:
I’ve tried kindness, patience, cunning – even harshness, at times, to bring her to her senses. But I’m afraid this malady runs in her family.
---

## JACK:
Her mother died in the madhouse, you know. What do you think of this necktie?
---

## ELIZABETH:
Oh – well – it’s –
---

## JACK:
I think it is all wrong.
---

## ELIZABETH:
No – it’s perfect, sir – you don’t need another!
---

## JACK:
Much better. The doctors will be coming to the house tomorrow morning, to examine our dear Bella.
---

## JACK:
I’ve fought the idea as long as possible, but now there is no avoiding it. Don’t you agree?
---

## ELIZABETH:
Oh, yes, sir –
---

## JACK:
And you will be expected to testify. You will be asked to tell the doctors what you have observed in this home.
Can I count on you for that?
---

## ELIZABETH:
I will help in any way I can.
---

## JACK:
Why are you holding my jacket?
---

## ELIZABETH:
Just making it ready for you, sir. Here we are.
---

## JACK:
You know, Elizabeth: at times you remind me of my mother. She was completely loyal to my father. As you are to me. I greatly admire that.
---

## ELIZABETH:
Always loyal to you, sir.
---

## JACK:
I’m going out to have my supper now. And after that, I might visit a club or two. Do you think that’s wrong?
---

## ELIZABETH:
Sir?
---

## JACK:
With my wife feeling ill, do you think it’s wrong of me to do that?
---

## ELIZABETH:
What I think, sir: is that you should get all the pleasure you can…while you can.
---

## JACK:
Words to live by. Good night, Elizabeth.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Well done, Elizabeth. Now, let’s return to our work.
---

## BELLA:
What did Jack want? Why did he come back?
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Only for a change of clothes.
---

## BELLA:
Wait – that tie you’re wearing belongs to Jack!
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Yes – and I rather fancy it! Goes nicely with my saucy shirt!

---


All right – let’s have another look at this bugger.
---

## BELLA:
But what if he comes home and catches us?
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
It’s the risk we’ve got to take. Keep watch at the window, Elizabeth.
---

## BELLA:
We should not be doing this…
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
The drawer is more stubborn than I expected. We are going to have to force it.
---

## BELLA:
Did you hear me? Jack will know we’ve gone through his things.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Yes, Mrs. Manningham! This is the point of no return! We must force this lock and gamble on finding something.
---

## BELLA:
But, what will I tell him when he discovers that –
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
I’ve no idea what you will tell him!
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Just as I’ve no idea what you will tell the doctors at the asylum when your husband orders you strapped to a bed for the rest of your life!
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Is that what you want?! Now: do we give up? Or do we gamble?
---

## BELLA:
Force it.
---

## BELLA:
Force it now!
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Here we go –
---

## BELLA:
But be quick about it –
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Well. That splintered quite badly. Let’s hope our gamble has paid off. It’s papers we are looking for.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Anything that will tie him to the name “Sydney Power.”
---

## BELLA:
That key there. That’s mine! He accused me of losing it.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
All part of his game.
---

## BELLA:
And that watch. Those bracelets. They are mine, as well!
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Yes – but we are looking for documents – identification –
---

## BELLA:
I didn’t lose them after all. It was him! He’s been hiding my things away!
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Please, Mrs. Manningham – you must allow me to do my work!
---

## BELLA:
And this! This is my brooch. It was a gift from Jack.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
We are looking for more than trinkets –
---

## BELLA:
It’s been missing for years. ages.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
– Aha! – Here are papers! – Deeper in the drawer…
---

## BELLA:
Is there a grocery bill there?
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
A what?
---

## BELLA:
He accused me tonight of hiding the grocery bill.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
I see nothing of the kind. Only some personal letters, and –
---

## BELLA:
Letters?
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Yes –
---

## BELLA:
They are all addressed to me!
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
I remind you we are looking for the name “Sydney Power” –
---

## ELIZABETH:
But who are they from?
---

## BELLA:
They are letters from my cousins. My aunts and uncles, as well!
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
There will be time to read your family correspondence later –
---

## BELLA:
I wrote to them every day – and I never heard back. Jack said they resented my inheritance.
---

## BELLA:
But Elizabeth – listen to this: “Dear Bella, we were overjoyed to hear from you! We hope you’ll come back for a visit very soon!”
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
There’s no proof here at all –
---

## BELLA:
They wanted to see me – but Jack hid their letters away!
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Nothing that identifies your husband as Sydney Power. We have lost our gamble, I’m afraid. The window, Elizabeth!
---

## ELIZABETH:
Yes, sir.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
You and I will put things back as best we can. I’ll need your letters – quickly – all of them.
---

## BELLA:
No – please – I cherish them –
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
You are the one who said we must leave no sign of our intrusion. The letters, please. There we are.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
And last, your brooch – It is a nice trinket, all right. When did he give you this?
---

## BELLA:
Soon after we were married. Even though I knew it was second-hand, I loved to wear it.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
There we are. We have covered our tracks, for now – – though I’m afraid our drawer is a bit worse for wear. Here, Elizabeth.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
This can be put back where it belongs.
---

## ELIZABETH:
What is it, sir?
---

## BELLA:
Sergeant Rough?
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Your brooch. How did you know it was second-hand?
---

## BELLA:
Oh – there’s an inscription inside. Just a few words…intended for someone other than me.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Can you show me?
---

## BELLA:
I was a bit heartsick, at first – to learn it was second-hand – but I liked the brooch so much that I said nothing.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
The inscription you mentioned – where is it?
---

## BELLA:
It’s sort of a trick. I only discovered it by accident. There’s a little pin in back.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Oh, I see it…
---

## BELLA:
You pull it gently toward the right. And that reveals a little hinge…
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Yes, look at that…
---

## BELLA:
…and that hinge allows it to open out, like a star.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
So it does…
---

## BELLA:
The inscription is hidden inside. It’s very small.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
“From your adoring husband. To my beloved A. B.” And these empty spaces here…what do they mean?
---

## BELLA:
Oh, there used to be beads in there.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Beads?
---

## BELLA:
Yes – but they kept falling out. Eventually I removed them all. No one could see them, anyway.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
And these beads…did you hold onto them by any chance?
---

## BELLA:
I put them in an old vase on the mantle. I never let them be disturbed.
---

## ELIZABETH:
Here they are!
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
There should be nine of them, total. Judging by the spaces in the brooch.
---

## BELLA:
I know they are only beads –

---


– but I thought they were so pretty. I meant to have them restored, but then the brooch went missing.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Mrs. Manningham – I must ask you something. Have you ever been embraced by an old police detective in his shirtsleeves?
---

## BELLA:
Well – no –
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
I should warn you: it is about to happen! The Barlow rubies have been found! Each and every one of them!
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Yes – that is the beauty of it!
---

## ELIZABETH:
They were in that old vase the whole time!
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
That is the cunning of our beloved “A. B.”!
---

## BELLA:
Alice Barlow!
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
She hid the rubies inside a common trinket she wore every day of her life.
---

## BELLA:
But what made you remember?
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
When I was first on the case, I studied portraits of her. In each portrait she was wearing that brooch.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Twenty-five years later, I still remembered that. Oh, am I not a wonderful man!
---

## ELIZABETH:
And you’ve had her brooch the whole time!
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Given to you second-hand, because Sydney Power could not resist a little common theft while he hunted the big game.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Well, it is I who am after the big game now!
---

## BELLA:
Are you leaving?
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Indeed I am!
---

## BELLA:
But why?
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Because I am going to move Heaven and Earth! And I am going to do it tonight, if I can. I shall need my coat and hat, Elizabeth.
---

## ELIZABETH:
Right away, sir.
---

## BELLA:
But where are you going?!
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
To see the Chief of Police! He said I must have new evidence to reopen this case. Well, look at the treasure trove we have found tonight!
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
The Barlow rubies will be safe with me. The brooch must be returned to its hiding spot. Exactly where we found it. Very good. Thank you, Elizabeth.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Now close the drawer, Mrs. Manningham. Did you hear me? You must close up the desk and go to your bed.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Under no circumstances are you to come downstairs while I am gone. Mrs. Manningham! – Do you hear me?
---

## ELIZABETH:
Ma’am – what is it?
---

## BELLA:
I’ve just had a terrible feeling. That something awful will happen if you leave. I’m afraid I will lose my courage.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Your courage shall prove unshakable. You must trust me on that.
Scene Two
---

## JACK:
Nancy? – Is that you? I can see you there in the hallway.
Are you just now coming in?
---

## NANCY:
Yes. Just like you.
---

## JACK:
But do you know what time it is?
---

## NANCY:
After eleven, I think.
---

## JACK:
I’ve just rung the bell, Nancy – because I am home, and I would like my shortbread and brandy.
---

## NANCY:
Doesn’t your wife usually leave that for you?
---

## JACK:
She does – but I’m told she went to bed with a headache.
---

## NANCY:
Once again.
---

## JACK:
Tell me, Nancy: do you recall a time when Mrs. Manningham did not go to bed with a headache?
---

## NANCY:
I do not.
---

## JACK:
I wonder if you’d be willing to attest to that fact.
---

## NANCY:
Would I kiss a Bible again, you mean?
---

## JACK:
Yes, exactly.
---

## NANCY:
Maybe I would.

---


Shortbread and brandy. As you wished.

---


You’re sure you don’t want more light?
---

## JACK:
I’m sure.
---

## NANCY:
Well, sir. Have your nightly needs been met?
---

## JACK:
You know, Nancy…you are given a great deal of latitude in this house. 

---

Permission to come and go as you please. It’s something that will get noticed.
---

## NANCY:
I don’t care who notices.
---

## JACK:
But we must keep up appearances, you and I. Like serving me while you are out of uniform.
---

## NANCY:
Shall I go change, sir?
---

## JACK:
No. Don’t do that.

---


You’ve brought two glasses. I will only need one.
---

## NANCY:
My apologies.
---

## JACK:
Where were you tonight?
---

## NANCY:
Out with friends.
---

## JACK:
You know, when you say “out with friends” I can’t help but think you were meeting a gentleman.
---

## NANCY:
No – nothing like that.
---

## JACK:
You weren’t seeing that young Mr. Booker?
---

## NANCY:
He’s not a gentleman. He’s just a boy – like all the rest of them. 

---

They make me laugh – they fill my time – but they don’t know what a woman wants.
---

## JACK:
But you’re only still a girl.
---

## NANCY:
Is that what you think?
---

## JACK:
Would you like some brandy?
---

## NANCY:
Maybe I would.
---

## JACK:
That is a very fetching dress.

---


Here is to keeping up appearances.
---

## NANCY:
How were your oysters?
---

## JACK:
They were taken away before I could enjoy them. You must try one sometime.
---

## NANCY:
Oh, I tried one. I liked it. It was like having a tongue in my mouth. 

---

I bet you don’t kiss like a boy. I bet you kiss like a man. Am I right?
---

## NANCY:
I wonder what you ask of all your girls. What you expect them to do.
---

## JACK:
What are you saying?
---

## NANCY:
I know what I’d do for you.
---

## JACK:
Yes…and what is that?
---

## NANCY:
I’d keep your secrets. You’d like that, wouldn’t you?
---

## JACK:
What secrets are you talking about?!
---

## NANCY:
I know you, Jack! I know exactly where you go when you go out on the town.
---

## JACK:
Oh, is that so?
---

## NANCY:
I know about all your actresses and dancers – your nimble little debutantes –
---

## JACK:
You are deluded, Nancy!
---

## NANCY:
Am I? I know all about your double life. And I know you’ll do anything to not be found out. Especially by your wife.
---

## NANCY:
It’s her money you’re living on, isn’t it?
---

## JACK:
For now. But that will change.
---

## NANCY:
What does that mean?
---

## JACK:
You know everything, Nancy! Yes – I go out and meet girls. That is my crime and you’ve found me out!
---

## NANCY:
That is not your crime.
---

## JACK:
Oh, really? Then what is?
---

## NANCY:
You are driving her mad. I’ve watched you do it.

---


But when the doctors arrive tomorrow morning…you will expect me to say otherwise. Won’t you, Jack?
---

## JACK:
Yes. Yes, I will.
---

## NANCY:
It will cost you.
---

## JACK:
Please tell my wife that I must see her.

---


Bella…
---

## NANCY:
She won’t leave her room. Says she’s not feeling well.
---

## JACK:
I told you to bring her down here!
---

## NANCY:
The door is locked. She must know your plan.
---

## JACK:
Quiet! – Let me think –
---

## NANCY:
Are those her letters?
---

## NANCY:
Look at that. All the little things you steal from her. You hide them in that drawer. And she never suspects.
---

## JACK:
Take this note to my wife. Slip it under the door.
---

## NANCY:
But what is it? What are you doing?
---

## JACK:
We are smoking her out, Nancy. Now, hurry –
---

## NANCY:
Don’t forget: I know your secrets.
---

## JACK:
Good evening, Bella.

---


Come and sit.

---


Elizabeth said you had a headache. Are you feeling better now?

---


Please join me. I have a chair for you.
---

## BELLA:
And letters. Your note said you have letters for me. From my family.
---

## JACK:
Come down. I want to talk to you about something.
---

## BELLA:
Your note said I could read them. You said it would be a nice thing.
---

## JACK:
Your chair is there.
---

## BELLA:
Where are the letters, Jack? I want to see them, please. I want to hold them in my hand.
---

## JACK:
Bella?
---

## BELLA:
Yes?
---

## JACK:
You are not sitting in the chair I indicated.
---

## BELLA:
Show me the letters.
---

## JACK:
There is something we must talk about first. To do that, you need to sit where I asked.
---

## BELLA:
My family didn’t want me to marry you. But I did…and I have…and here we are…
---

## JACK:
Why are you sitting over there? Are you afraid of me?
---

## BELLA:
I am not afraid of you. It’s the strangest thing. I am not afraid of you at all.
---

## JACK:
Then you have a great deal of courage.
---

## BELLA:
Yes. I’ve been told that.
---

## JACK:
Well. Since you are so courageous, won’t you sit where I’ve told you to sit?
---

## BELLA:
And then you’ll give me my letters?
---

## JACK:
Yes, of course. Do you know what you remind me of, Bella? A sleepwalker.
---

## JACK:
The way you move around this house in a daze – your body adrift, your mind wandering.
---

## BELLA:
My mind is not wandering.
---

## JACK:
I was told you had gone to bed.
---

## BELLA:
That’s true.
---

## JACK:
Then why are you still fully dressed?
---

## BELLA:
I don’t know. But I slept, Jack. I slept so deeply. I have never slept like that before.
---

## JACK:
And you are radiant. Suddenly there is color in your cheeks. Like you’ve had some kind of excitement since I left.
---

## BELLA:
No. Nothing like that.
---

## JACK:
I asked you to find the grocery bill and place it on my desk. Did you do that?
---

## BELLA:
I did not.
---

## JACK:
Do you remember what I said would happen if you failed to do that? What the consequences would be?
---

## BELLA:
You said you would have me locked up.
---

## JACK:
And did you believe me?
---

## BELLA:
Yes.
---

## JACK:
Why?
---

## BELLA:
Because you have trained me to believe you.
---

## JACK:
Did you open my desk?
---

## BELLA:
No – I would never do that. You know I don’t go near your desk.
---

## JACK:
Then how do you explain this?
---

## BELLA:
Please, Jack –
---

## JACK:
Come and look. I want you to see what you’ve done.
---

## BELLA:
– I want to sleep again. I want to sleep like I did before.
---

## JACK:
Of course you do.
---

## BELLA:
I’m tired, Jack.
---

## JACK:
Yes, I know.
---

## BELLA:
I’m suddenly so tired.
---

## JACK:
Your mind is tired. So tired that it can no longer work at all. That’s what I wanted to talk to you about.
---

## JACK:
It seems you no longer think, Bella. You only dream.

---


You can’t help it – you are not aware of it – you have no power over it –
---

## BELLA:
No…
---

## JACK:
– but you dream incessantly. It seems you move about in your sleep, conspiring against me when I’m gone.
---

## BELLA:
No…
---

## JACK:
You have done it again tonight.
---

## BELLA:
I swear to you I haven’t…
---

## JACK:
In your nightly wandering, you have broken into my desk.
---

## BELLA:
You are saying I have dreamt it?
---

## JACK:
That is your pattern, Bella: you commit crimes against me…and then you claim to be unaware of them.
---

## BELLA:
I have dreamt all that has happened tonight?
---

## JACK:
“All that has happened?” What does that mean?
---

## BELLA:
I can’t have dreamt the whiskey and the saucy shirt –
---

## JACK:
The what?
---

## BELLA:
– the man who nabbed Sandham the Throttler –
---

## JACK:
You are making no sense –
---

## BELLA:
It can’t be true, Jack! Please tell me I have not dreamt it – not dreamt everything that happened tonight!
---

## JACK:
I must know, Bella! I must know what happened in this dream of yours.
---

## BELLA:
I dreamt –
---

## JACK:
Yes? Go on.
---

## BELLA:
I can’t. It can’t have happened.
---

## JACK:
Try, Bella…
---

## BELLA:
I dreamt that a man…came here, to our house.
---

## JACK:
Who was it?
---

## BELLA:
Please let me go to my bed, Jack –
---

## JACK:
No – you must tell me this first! Who is this man you’re speaking of?!
---

## BELLA:
He had waited for you to be gone… then he came to speak to me. He stood right there by the door…
---

## JACK:
But what did he want?
---

## BELLA:
It was the strangest thing: he wanted to be kind to me. I dreamt he came here to help me…
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Was I, perhaps, the man of your dreams?
---

## BELLA:
Oh my…
---

## JACK:
Who are you? – Who let you in?!
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
I am a ghost. I can appear anywhere I wish.
---

## JACK:
What business do you have with us?
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
None at all – until my associates arrive. I expect them momentarily.
---

## JACK:
Go to your room, Bella.
---

## BELLA:
But this man…
---

## JACK:
You wanted to sleep, remember? Do that. We will finish this later.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Sweet dreams…
You won’t finish it later. It is finished already.
---

## JACK:
Tell me your name and what you want.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
As a ghost I have no name – JACK. Listen to me –
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
– but I am able to hover over a house.
---

## JACK:
I will call the police and have you thrown out of here.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
The police! – What a good idea! If only I’d thought of that.

---


Look there: my friends have appeared. See the light – the way it dims.
---

## JACK:
That is only the gas in the lamps –
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Oh, no – these are the ghostly spirits who have come to protect me. Eerie, isn’t it? Being in the dark.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
I was in the dark about you for a long time, Mr. Manningham. But the Spirits of Justice have come to serve your reckoning.
---

## JACK:
Whoever you are, you’re making no sense –
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
I’m nothing but an old man seeing ghosts. And I see them everywhere – especially in this room. 

---

I see an old woman sitting in her chair.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
That chair – right where you stand. And I see another ghost. A young man. Well-bred, well-groomed – but he has murder in his eyes.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
In his hands, he holds a weapon.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
The old woman sees him – but it is too late! He cuts her throat to stop her screaming!
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
And he stands there – this young man – this Sydney Power – he stands there with the blood of Alice Barlow on his hands. 

---

She lies dead on the floor.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Right there! Desperate now, he tears the house apart – looking for his hidden treasure – but he finds nothing.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
And twenty-five years later – he tries again –
---

## JACK:
No! – It’s not true!
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
– but JUSTICE has now found what HE never could find! The Barlow rubies!
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Hidden inside a simple trinket – one that you filched from this house years ago and pawned off on your wife as a gift.
---

## JACK:
That’s impossible…
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
You killed one woman for these rubies. You sought to drive another one mad.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
But your malevolence has gained you nothing but a date with your executioner!
---

## JACK:
You’ve got NO PROOF –
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
COME ON IN, FELLAS.
---

## JACK:
NO PROOF AT ALL!
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
As you can see: my associates have arrived.
---

## JACK:
You fool! – You bastard!
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
I’m sorry. Come again?
---

## JACK:
You dirty LIMEY BASTARD!
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Sydney Reginald Power. You are charged in the murder of Mrs. Alice Barlow.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Anything you say may be taken down in writing and used as evidence at your trial. Come quietly, now. We needn’t wake your wife.
---

## BELLA:
What has happened? – Why are the police here?
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Our work is done. You needn’t see this man again.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Here we go, fellas.
---

## BELLA:
But wait – I must speak to him.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
There’s no need –
---

## BELLA:
I must tell him about my dream.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
There will be another time for that –
---

## BELLA:
But I need to speak to him now.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Alright then – there he is: say what you need to say!
---

## BELLA:
I must speak to him alone.
Please…you can’t imagine how many things I need to say to him…
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Very well. Tie him fast to that chair.

---


Tighter. Like this.
---

## JACK:
Aauaugh!
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Three minutes. Not a moment more. We will be just outside the door.
---

## BELLA:
I don’t want you to listen.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
You are on your own, Mrs. Manningham.
---

## JACK:
Bella… say something… are you there, Bella? …I want to know you’re there…

---


Bella, please – we haven’t much time…

---


…BELLA, BELLA…SMILE FOR YOUR FELLA…
---

## BELLA:
We are here.
---

## JACK:
BELLA…
---

## BELLA:
Together.
---

## JACK:
…BELLA…
---

## BELLA:
In our home. And now I know the truth. The truth is…it was all a dream.
---

## BELLA:
What have they done to you, Jack?
---

## JACK:
It’s nothing – it’s all right –
---

## BELLA:
What has happened?
---

## JACK:
It was a dream, remember? – Nothing more! And you are so clever, my darling –
---

## BELLA:
Yes, but –
---

## JACK:
– You are such a clever girl! So smart to get them out of the room. 

---

Now, listen to me: I need something to cut the rope –
---

## BELLA:
But they are right outside the door –
---

## JACK:
If you free me, I can go upstairs and out the skylight on the upper floor –
---

## BELLA:
The rope is too strong –
---

## JACK:
There is a razor in my closet. It is in a wooden case.
---

## BELLA:
A razor – yes –
---

## JACK:
Hurry – on the shelf to the right –
---

## BELLA:
– Yes – I’ll get the razor, Jack – I’ll be quick –

---


## VOICE OF SERGEANT ROUGH:
MRS. MANNINGHAM? EVERYTHING ALRIGHT?
---

## BELLA:
JUST ANOTHER MINUTE!
---

## JACK:
Good – yes – you shall save us both, Bella! – Now, open it and take out the razor –

---


The razor, Bella…
---

## BELLA:
Oh, my. It’s here, Jack! The grocery bill. I’ve found it!
---

## JACK:
Yes, now –
---

## BELLA:
You see, my darling – I didn’t lose it after all! I told you I didn’t lose the grocery bill!
---

## JACK:
Cut me loose, Bella –

---


You must hurry –

---


Bella – what is it?
---

## BELLA:
How did the grocery bill get inside your razor case?
---

## JACK:
Bella, please – it’s nothing – BELLA. I have never opened this case.
---

## JACK:
– It was my mistake –
---

## BELLA:
I never go in your closet.
---

## JACK:
– I must have forgot that I –
---

## BELLA:
I could not have put this bill in there.
---

## JACK:
– Bella, you must listen – 

---

## BELLA:
It was you. It was you all along.
---

## JACK:
No – Bella –
---

## BELLA:
It’s true, isn’t it?! Tell me the truth!
---

## JACK:
– The razor, Bella –
---

## BELLA:
I want the truth to be told in this home.
---

## JACK:
– Use the razor to free me!
---

## BELLA:
What razor, Jack? I see no razor. I think it’s just your “overactive imagination.”
---

## JACK:
Stop this, Bella – they are coming for me –
---

## BELLA:
–I think you may be going mad!
---

## JACK:
– They will be back in a moment – BELLA. Oh, I know all about that!
---

## JACK:
Take the razor and cut the ropes!
---

## BELLA:
But I can’t FIND the razor, Jack! You know how I’m always LOSING THINGS.

---


Where could that RAZOR BE?!
---

## JACK:
BELLA – PLEASE –
---

## BELLA:
Could the razor be in your desk?!

---


NO – I DON’T SEE IT. 

---

## VOICE OF SERGEANT ROUGH:
MRS. MANNINGHAM?
---

## BELLA:
Maybe it is hidden in your chair?! NO – I CAN’T FIND IT.
---

## BELLA:
Maybe you keep it behind this painting – Your beloved father – the one who raised you to be the man you are today!
---

## JACK:
NO! BELLA, STOP –

---


## VOICE OF SERGEANT ROUGH:
MRS. MANNINGHAM – IT’S TIME –
---

## BELLA:
I KNOW WHAT IT’S LIKE TO BE BOUND WITH ROPES. In a room – in a house – in a marriage!
---

## JACK:
You must HELP ME, Bella!
---

## BELLA:
How can I help you?! I’m nothing but a perfect little silly, REMEMBER? Just a sleepwalking lunatic with a busy little mind!
---

## JACK:
Bella, PLEASE –
---

## BELLA:
You were right, Jack: I have been driven mad. And here’s how I know: because I have failed to HATE YOU. 

---

I pitied and protected you.
---

## BELLA:
I believed you were my husband and my hopes and my future. And that is MADNESS, Jack. But it is changing. 

---

It is changing right this instant –
---

## BELLA:
– because I am no longer dreaming. I have never been so awake in my own life!

---


SERGEANT ROUGH! COME TAKE HIM AWAY!
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
You are safe, Mrs. Manningham. He will never trouble you again Get him on his feet – He will be locked up, awaiting trial.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
But we may still need testimony. From you, Mrs. Manningham – and from the other women in the house.
---

## JACK:
They won’t tell you anything! These women are loyal to me. Aren’t you, Elizabeth?
---

## ELIZABETH:
You may count on me – Sergeant Rough.
---

## JACK:
No – don’t believe her – she’s lying – 

---

## ELIZABETH:
No one dare call me a liar.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
What about you, Nancy?
---

## JACK:
Yes, Nancy – tell them! You saw it all! Tell them how she stole from me, hid my things away –
---

## NANCY:
You’re right, Jack. I saw it all.
---

## JACK:
Thank you.
---

## NANCY:
I watched you drive her mad.
---

## JACK:
NO –
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
You will testify against your master?
---

## NANCY:
He was never my master. He was just a man who And then he tried to kiss me –
---

## JACK:
Nancy – don’t do this –
---

## NANCY:
– Kiss me to shut me up – kiss me because I knew his secrets – because I’d watched him hide things from his wife.
---

## JACK:
Don’t listen to her. She’s deluded!
---

## NANCY:
Am I, Jack? Am I deluded? Just like your wife and Elizabeth and all the girls downtown? How does that work, Jack?! 

---

How can we ALL be so deluded?
---

## JACK:
You foolish little –
---

## NANCY:
Sergeant Rough: it would be my pleasure to watch him hang.
---

## JACK:
You’ve got nothing on me!
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Quiet!
---

## JACK:
Nothing but trinkets. Not a shred of evidence that ties me to Sydney Power!
---

## BELLA:
That portrait, Sergeant Rough…on the back of it there is a name stenciled.
---

## BELLA:
I had always thought it was the name of the artist… …but now I understand: it is the name of the painting’s subject.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
“Reginald Power.” Father of Sydney Reginald Power. There is our proof.
---

## BELLA:
But the letters from my family? They are not in the drawer.
---

## JACK:
I’ve hidden your letters, Bella. You’ll need to tear this house apart to find them.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Get him out of here.
---

## JACK:
You’ll be sorry, Bella!
---

## JACK:
YOU WILL NEVER FORGET ME!
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Let me get you a chair.
---

## BELLA:
Jack’s right, isn’t he? That he won’t go away.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Not easily, no.
---

## BELLA:
He will always be here…haunting this house… 

---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
Nancy – we will need something from my coat in the hallway.
---

## BELLA:
And two glass tumblers, as well.
---

## NANCY:
Right away, sir.
---

## SERGEANT ROUGH:
I am sorry, you know. I fear I have put you through the worst night imaginable.
---

## BELLA:
I won’t remember it that way. I believe I will remember it as the first night of my life.
