## FONSIA:
Oh, I…I didn’t think anybody was out here.

---

## WELLER:
I’m sorry I startled you.

---

## FONSIA:
Oh, it wasn’t you…it was just…my mind was a thousand miles
away.

---

## WELLER:
They keep them locked.

---

## FONSIA:
Oh…

---

## WELLER:
You’re rather new here, aren’t you?

---

## FONSIA:
Three weeks.

---

## WELLER:
It takes some adjustment.

---

## FONSIA:
How long have you been here?

---

## WELLER:
Couple of months.

---

## FONSIA:
Well, you’re kinda new here, too.

---

## WELLER:
In a way. Of course, it’s not the first time I’ve lived in.
They’re all pretty much alike.

---

## FONSIA:
I came here to Bentley because they’re supposed to have
constant care.

---

## WELLER:
What’s wrong with you - if you don’t mind my asking?

---

## FONSIA:
Oh, my…Lord, no, I don’t mind. I’ve got chronic diabetes.

---

## WELLER:
Diabetes mellitus.

---

## FONSIA:
Is there something wrong with you? I mean, are you sick?

---

## WELLER:
Oh my, I should say so. I have one of the most advanced cases
of old age in the history of medical science. 

---

The mortality rate’s
incredible.


---

## FONSIA:
I just thought there might be something you were getting
treatment for.

---

## WELLER:
No. You don’t need anything special to qualify for Bently.
Old age is sufficient.

---

## FONSIA:
Have you ever lived at the Presbyterian Home?

---

## WELLER:
No.

---

## FONSIA:
That’s the place I really wanted to go to.

---

## WELLER:
Why didn’t you?

---

## FONSIA:
Well, they have a rather unusual financial set-up.

---

## WELLER:
What’s that?

---

## FONSIA:
You have to give them all your money.

---

## WELLER:
That’s the place. That’s the goddamn place. That’s the place
where you have to give them all your money. 

---

The Presbyterian Home…Christ, what a racket.

---

Think of all the poor bastards out there right
now, thinking they’re working for themselves, when really they’re
working for the Presbyterian Home.

---

## FONSIA:
They don’t have to go there.

---

## WELLER:
Oh. Hell no. They don’t have to go there. 

---

They don’t have to
go anywhere if they don’t want to…


---

That’s a damn lie. You do have to go somewhere. 

---

If you live long
enough, sooner or later you end up in one of these places.

---

## FONSIA:
I guess you’re right.
Course, if you were rich enough…

---

## WELLER:
Don’t be deluded by money, either. I’ve seen some very
wealthy people in old age homes. 

---

Loneliness-it’s as simple as that.

---

## FONSIA:
That’s why I wanted to go to the Presbyterian Home. 

---

I have
friends over there I’ve known all my life.

---

## WELLER:
Then why didn’t you give them all your money?


---

## FONSIA:
I couldn’t bring myself to do that.

---

## WELLER:
Who the hell could? It’s unreasonable to expect a person to
turn over everything they have. 

---

I don’t care how nice the place is.
You’re entitled to some personal property. 

---

Even the welfare
department lets you keep twenty-five-hundred dollars.

---

## FONSIA:
You might be right. I’m sure they have their side of it, too.


---

It’s just a matter of opinion, I guess.

---

## WELLER:
It’s not a matter of opinion. A fact is a fact.
Do you play cards?

---

## FONSIA:
Oh, it’s been years since I’ve played cards. 

---

I used to love
to play…I could sit up playing rummy or pinochle till two o’clock in
the morning. 

---

If my mother’d ever known I was doing that, she’s a
killed me. 

---

We were raised “old school” Presbyterian, you know. 

---

And we
considered card playing a sin.

---

## WELLER:
The only sin in card playing is drawing to an inside
straight. And even that's not a sin if you fill it.

---

## FONSIA:
That's poker you're talking about, isn't it?

---

## WELLER:
What? Oh, the inside straight. Yes, that's poker.

---

## FONSIA:
I never did see much sense to that. 

---

For one thing, I could
never keep straight what beats what.

---

## WELLER:
Did you ever play gin?

---

## FONSIA:
Is gin and rummy the same? Seems to me they called it gin
rummy.

---

## WELLER:
It's the same principle. I keep score on what's known as the
Hollywood basis. 

---

Here, sit down over here and I'll show you.

---


Just let me get another chair…and something to keep score on …
and we'll be all set.

---


There. By the way, I'm Weller Martin.


---

## FONSIA:
I'm Fonsia Dorsey.

---

## WELLER:
Pleased to meet you, Fonsia. 

---

Now, the first thing we do …
I
think you're going to enjoy this…is deal the cards…

---

ten for me
and eleven for you. 

---

One, one. Two, two. Three, three. Four, four.
Five, five. Six, six. Seven, seven. Eight, eight. Nine, nine. Ten,
ten. 

---

And eleven for you. 

---

Now, the reason I'm giving you eleven is
because you have to discard one to start the game.

---

## FONSIA:
All the same kind go together …like kings and eights?

---

## WELLER:
That's right-or a sequence in the same suit…like the
eight, nine, ten of diamonds, or the king, queen, jack of hearts. 

---

But
it has to be at least three in a row.

---

## FONSIA:
Do I lay them down as soon as I get them?

---

## WELLER:
No…uh-uh. Hold on until everything you have in your hand
goes together, except one card. 

---

Then you discard that card and say
"gin."

---

## FONSIA:
Oh. Well, that's a little different. We used to play that you
laid them down as soon as you got them. 

---

You know, three of a kind or
whatever.

---

## WELLER:
Well, this is the accepted way. You go anywhere in the world
and this is the way that gin will be played.

---

## FONSIA:
Oh, I accept it.

---

## WELLER:
Good.

---

## FONSIA:
I mean, I like the idea. You kind of surprise the other
person when you get gin.

---

## WELLER:
That's right. Oh …and there's another way of going out.
That's by knocking.

---

## FONSIA:
Knocking?


---

## WELLER:
Now, all that means is, if all the cards you have in your
hand that don't match up add up to less than ten points, you can
knock.

---

## FONSIA:
Uh-huh.

---

## WELLER:
Did I say that right? Here, I'll show you. Well, your cards
are all matched up, except this six and this two. 

---

You can knock, if
you want to. You'd say, "I knock with eight points." 

---

Now, if I have
more than eight points, you win. If I have less than eight points…
I win. 

---

Do you understand that?

---

## FONSIA:
I think so…but I think I'll stick to the gin part of the
game at first.

---

## WELLER:
That's all right. You think you've got it now?

---

## FONSIA:
I think so.

---

## WELLER:
Good. Then, let's play.

---

## WELLER:
Fonsia…Weller. Fonsia…Weller.

---

Oh, don't worry. I'll keep
score all the time. 

---

Some people play to 150 points, but we'll just
play to 100. Still bona fide, only faster.

---


Here, give me those to shuffle up and we'll start all over again.

---

## FONSIA:
This is exciting! I'm actually enjoying myself. If you'd told
me 15 minutes ago that ..

---

## WELLER:
One, one. Two, two. Three, three. Four, four. Five, five.
Six, six. Seven, seven. 

---

Eight, eight. Nine, nine. Ten, ten. And
eleven for you.

---

## FONSIA:
..fifteen minutes ago that I'd be sitting here playing gin
rummy with someone.

---

## WELLER:
No, no, no. I can see all your cards. You have to keep them
up…like this.


---

## FONSIA:
Oh. Oh, you're right. I'm sorry.

---

## WELLER:
Now it's your first play, so you're going to want to discard
one.

---

## FONSIA:
And I keep them all in my hand- even if they go together…

---

## WELLER:
Yes. You keep them in your hand. And you keep them up.

---

## FONSIA:
Oh, I'm sorry. I did it again, didn't I?

---

## WELLER:
I'll tell you what - I'll just sit over here. How about that?

---

## FONSIA:
Oh, well…

---

## WELLER:
No harm done. No harm done.

---

## WELLER:
There we are.

---

## FONSIA:
I thought this was going to be an awful day.

---

## WELLER:
Visitors' day.

---

## FONSIA:
Um-hum.

---

## WELLER:
Do you have any family?

---

## FONSIA:
Oh my, yes. Of course. I have a son almost forty-five years
old …Larry.

---

## WELLER:
Mr. Dorsey passed on?

---

## FONSIA:
We were only married four years. We were divorced when Larry
was two.

---

## WELLER:
Oh, I see.


---

## FONSIA:
Actually, Walter did pass on not too long ago. Then I have a
sister, Hattie. 

---

She lives in Ottawa. I haven't seen her in fifteen
years.

---

## WELLER:
Your son live here in town?

---

## FONSIA:
No. Ah…he and his wife make their home in Denver.

---

## WELLER:
Denver! Well, I guess you don't see much of him, either.

---

## FONSIA:
No. It's been more than a year since he's been home.

---

## FONSIA:
And then I have two lovely grandchildren, both boys. Steven's
twelve …and Larry Junior …

---

Oh my Lord, Larry Junior must be
sixteen. Almost a man.

---

## WELLER:
They grow up quickly.

---

## FONSIA:
Do you have any children?

---

## WELLER:
Yes, I have…

---

## FONSIA:
Wait a minute. Oh, I am sorry, Weller. I think I'm sitting
here with gin in my hand already. 

---

Let's see, there's four of the
kings, three nines, and the five, six, seven of spades. 

---

I've got the
eight, too. I guess I just discard that.

---

## WELLER:
That's right. Very good. Very good. Now, you get twenty-five
for gin. 

---

I'm stuck with the eight and nine of hearts, so that's
seventeen more. So you're forty-two points to the good.

---


Fonsia, forty-two points in the first game.

---

## FONSIA:
Oh, I am sorry. I get to talking and I forget what I'm doing.

---

## WELLER:
You played that hand very well.


---

## FONSIA:
Beginner's luck, I guess.

---

## WELLER:
No, really. A lot of people would have discarded those two
kings right away. 

---

But you held onto them and filled them out.

---

## FONSIA:
I didn't realize there was that much strategy to it.

---

## WELLER:
There most certainly is. Anyone who tells you that gin is
nothing but luck doesn't know what the game is all about.

---

## FONSIA:
Oh, I was just about to ask you…

---

## WELLER:
One, one. Two, two. Three, three. Four, four. Five, five.
Six, six. Seven, seven. 

---

Eight, eight. Nine, nine. Ten, ten. Eleven
for you.

---

## FONSIA:
…to ask you about your children.

---

## WELLER:
I have three children…all grown, of course. Two sons and
a daughter.

---

## FONSIA:
Do you hear from them much?

---

## WELLER:
No. Actually, we've lost touch over the years.

---

## FONSIA:
That's awful. .. I mean, to lose touch that way.

---

## WELLER:
That happened many years ago. I'm also divorced. 

---

Their mother
didn't exactly encourage a close relationship between us. She
moved-she and the children-to another city. 

---

I had a business
established so I couldn't follow them. 

---

Eventually, she remarried, and
that was more or less the end of that.

---

## FONSIA:
How dreadful.


---

## WELLER:
Well, in those days the courts gave the woman a great deal
of power in a divorce settlement. 

---

There was very little I could do
about it.

---

## FONSIA:
Well, I'm sorry that happened to you, Weller. 

---

Now, that's
exactly what some men deserve. 

---

Seems like there's no justice. Now
that would have suited the one I had just right.

---

## WELLER:
It doesn't suit anyone just right.

---

## FONSIA:
Oh, I don't mean you, Weller. Lord no. I'm talking about the
man I married.

---

## WELLER:
I know. And I'm saying I wouldn't wish it on him, either.

---

## FONSIA:
Well, if you knew the hell I'd been through, you'd change
your tune mighty fast on that. 

---

Gin!

---

## WELLER:
So it is. So it is. I'm stuck with…twenty-three. No more
lessons for you.

---

## FONSIA:
That was lucky. I got everything I needed right away.

---

## WELLER:
You certainly did.

---

## FONSIA:
It's pleasant out here…in a way. The rooms are small,
though. 

---

Trying to get all your worldly possessions in a little
ten-foot-square box…makes you realize—

---

## WELLER:
One, one. Two, two. Three, three. Four, four. Five, five.
Six, six. Seven, seven. 

---

Eight, eight. Nine, nine. Ten, ten. And
eleven for you. Makes you realize what?

---

## FONSIA:
Just makes you realize.

---

## FONSIA:
Oh! I must be losing my mind.

---

There. What'd you do with all the things you had? You must have had a
lot of things.

---

## WELLER:
I sold them.

---

## FONSIA:
It's hard to part with things you've had so many years.

---

## WELLER:
Does the food around here give you diarrhea?

---

## FONSIA:
Weller!

---

## WELLER:
That's a legitimate question.

---

## FONSIA:
Not that I've noticed.

---

## WELLER:
You'd notice.

---

## FONSIA:
This is a mess.

---

## WELLER:
It must be better than this.

---

## FONSIA:
What did you do for a living?

---

## WELLER:
I was in business.

---

## FONSIA:
I always wanted Larry to go to work for the Gas and Electric
Company. 

---

The pay's regular and they treat their people so good. But
not him.

---

## WELLER:
I was a professional. I owned my own business.

---

## FONSIA:
Oh. I see…

---

## WELLER:
I had a marketing and research firm.

---

## FONSIA:
My. And so what kind of work did you do?


---

## WELLER:
Well, basically I told people how to run their business. 

---

If a
company had a product it wanted to sell—

---

I'd tell them who to sell it to-where to sell it—and how much to
charge for it.

---

## FONSIA:
That's something I could never figure out.

---

## WELLER:
What's that?

---

## FONSIA:
How much to charge for something.

---

## WELLER:
What were you selling?

---

## FONSIA:
Nothing. But I'd see something I liked…like a lamp. 

---

And
I'd look at the price tag and it would cost ten dollars. 

---

And then I'd
see another lamp just like it and it'd cost over a hundred. 

---

There was
just no way of telling.

---

## WELLER:
Well, that'll happen sometimes. 

---

I remember when I was just
getting started in business I wanted a job from this particular
company. 

---

I was sitting in a room with a group of their executives,
and finally the president turned to me and said, "How much is this
going to cost us?" 

---

Well, I was afraid to ask for much money in those
days. 

---

I thought the job was worth about five hundred-but I cut it
back to four. 

---

I was so nervous I just said the word "four." 

---

Then the
president turned to one of the other men in the room and he said,
"Does four thousand sound in line to you, Harry?" 

---

And he said,
''Yeah. That sounds about right to me."

---

## FONSIA:
Weller, you're making that up.

---

## WELLER:
As God is my judge, he said, ''Yeah. That sounds about right
to me."

---

## FONSIA:
Did you tell him you meant four hundred?

---

## WELLER:
What?


---

## FONSIA:
Well, if it was only worth five hundred.

---

## WELLER:
It was worth whatever he was willing to pay.

---

## FONSIA:
Finally! Gin.

---

## WELLER:
Goddamnit. I knew you were keeping jacks. Now what'd I do
that for? I gave it right to you. 

---

Talking too damn much.

---

## FONSIA:
You know, I never heard my father say a curse word in his
life.

---

## WELLER:
Obviously you never played gin with him ..

---

## FONSIA:
I should hope not. Papa would never have·played cards.

---

He didn't smoke, drink or run around either.

---

## WELLER:
Admirable. Minor virtues, but admirable nevertheless. You
know, I've been thinking more and more lately about my father. 

---

Now
there was a man who never settled for checker-playing in the park.


---

After he retired, he still went to the office every morning until the
day he died at the age of eighty-three. 

---

Of course, he owned his own company so he could do that. 

---

Thank God he had better luck with his business partners than I did.

---

## FONSIA:
Did you have bad luck?

---

[Choir Signing "Day By Day" Off Stage]

---


## WELLER:
One, one. Two, two. Three, three. Four, four. Five, five.
Six, six. Seven, seven. 

---

Eight, eight. Nine, nine. Ten, ten. Eleven.
What the hell are they doing in there now?

---

## FONSIA:
Oh, that's probably the Songfest.

---

## WELLER:
I don't understand all this "entertainment."


---

## FONSIA:
That's a group of singers from the Grace Avenue Methodist
Church choir. Some of them sang professionally.

---

## WELLER:
I don't mean who is singing. I'm talking about this constant
need to entertain us. 

---

Sometimes I get the idea that they feel like
if they don't have a choir up there, or if they don't have a goddamn
magician up there doing tricks or something, 

---

then we're all going to
drop dead right in front of their eyes. En masse. 

---

Then they're going to feel guilty as all hell, because deep down, 

---

they know that the Grace Avenue Methodist Church choir could've kept us alive-at least for another night.

---

## FONSIA:
I thought the magician was pretty good.

---

## WELLER:
He poured milked all over the floor.

---

## FONSIA:
He made it disappear. I know it was a trick. But when he
poured it in the newspaper it did disappear.

---

## WELLER:
It went all over the floor. I was in the front row, I saw it.

---

## FONSIA:
Well…you couldn't see it from three or four rows back.

---

## WELLER:
That's why magicians like to play old age homes. 

---

Half the
audience is shaking so goddamn bad they can't focus, and the other
half's asleep. 

---

I'd better pay attention to what I'm doing here.

---

## FONSIA:
They have dance lessons every Monday night after dinner.

---

## WELLER:
Yeah, that's great too, isn't it? Dance lessons in a place
where half the people can't even get out of a chair.

---

## FONSIA:
I used to love to dance. Did you ever dance?

---

## WELLER:
Of course I did. At one time I was known as a very fine
dancer, as a matter of fact.

---

## FONSIA:
They play one song that I just love.


---

## WELLER:
I hope it's not the same one they play all the time. It must
be the only song they have. I get so sick of hearing it I close the
door.

---

## FONSIA:
But there's one part that's just so beautiful.

---

## WELLER:
Give me big band music. Now that's something you can dance
to.

---

## FONSIA:
Oh, I love that too. Maybe -

---

## WELLER:
You'd never catch me in there. Not with that bunch of
amateurs. Shuffling around…

---

## WELLER:
Now what are you looking for?…

---

## FONSIA:
Well, I'll tell you…

---

## WELLER:
No - don't tell me!

---

## FONSIA:
All right. Maybe I wasn't really going to tell you anyway.

---

## WELLER:
It's one of these two cards, I know that much. 

---

And I have a
feeling that the one I discard is going to be the one you want.
Well…here goes nothing.

---

## FONSIA:
You were right, Weller. Gin.

---

## WELLER:
Good God, Fonsia!

---

[Transition Jam Blues Music]

---


## FONSIA:
Weller?

---

## WELLER:
Ally, ally, in free…

---

## FONSIA:
What?

---

## WELLER:
You didn't find me.


---

## FONSIA:
Weller, have you gone crazy?

---

## WELLER:
I must admit that's a very appealing thought at times.


---

Unfortunately, this time I've done nothing more bizarre than select a
book…from the bottom shelf.

---

## FONSIA:
For a minute there, I thought you'd lost your mind.

---

## WELLER:
No. Although this place inspires a certain looniness.

---

## FONSIA:
This is practically the first time I've seen you to talk to
all week.

---

## WELLER:
Since I met my Waterloo at gin.

---

## FONSIA:
That was fun.

---

## WELLER:
Perhaps you'll grant me a rematch this afternoon.

---

## FONSIA:
I'd love to.

---

## WELLER:
Listen to them in there. Every visitors' day it's bedlam
around here.

---

## FONSIA:
Thank God they don't come out here.

---

## WELLER:
Oh. A couple of them stumble out here every now and then. 

---

A few weeks ago, Gladys Mayes' daughter and son-in-law brought her out here on the porch.

---

## FONSIA:
Isn't that a tribe?

---

## WELLER:
They didn't have the children with them. But they talk so
loud. Like the old lady's deaf. 

---

Hell, there's nothing wrong with her hearing.

---

When she's out here alone, she tells me not to make so much
noise shuffling the cards.

---

## FONSIA:
She's thin as a rail.

---

## WELLER:
They brought a sandwich out here to her…tried to get her
to eat it.

---

## FONSIA:
She won't eat a bite. I don't know what keeps her alive.

---

## WELLER:
They had a coloring book, too. Wanted her to occupy herself
coloring.

---

## FONSIA:
Poor soul. She sits to the window all day. Coloring would be
something for her to do.

---

## WELLER:
Oh, she'd have no part of it. Then they started talking about
me…as though I wasn't even there! 

---

Like I was a piece of furniture or something. At one point the daughter said, "See, that nice man amuses himself playing cards."

---

I couldn't believe it! I looked at her …then in that loud voice she said, "Don't we, sir."

---

## FONSIA:
What did you say?

---

## WELLER:
I didn't answer. I was dumbfounded. Here this woman is
defining my life…in one sentence! Or at least she thinks she is…
and I'm supposed to agree with her. That nice man amuses himself
playing cards.

---

## FONSIA:
Oh no, Weller. I don't think she meant it that way. She
probably just wanted to show Gladys that there are things to do other
than stare out of the window.

---

## WELLER:
Why use me as the model retiree, for Christsake?

---

## FONSIA:
Weller, she wasn't talking about your life. My Lord, look at
all the things you've done.

---

## WELLER:
No…but she was talking about my life the way it is now.
I'm still alive, damnit.


---

## FONSIA:
Well, I should hope to tell you.

---

## WELLER:
Still, I don't know. Maybe I am a little jumpy. I just don't
know how to act with people anymore. 

---

I'm unsure of myself…rusty. There's nobody to have a decent conversation with around here anyway.


---

You're the only one I talk to.

---

## FONSIA:
I know. It's awful. You'd think there'd be somebody you'd like to talk to in a place that has as many people as they have here.

---

## WELLER:
Half of them are catatonic, for Christsake. 

---

And sometimes the ones who do talk make you appreciate the ones who don't.

---

## FONSIA:
The complaining?

---

## WELLER:
Yes.

---

## FONSIA:
Did you ever hear so many aches and pains in your life? (mimicking) "My Lord child, my back is killing me."

---

## WELLER:
I know her. Or, "I can't see as far as from here to that door." What are you going to do?

---

It's either that or listen to the help talk to you like a child.

---

## FONSIA:
Isn't it the truth? You know, I never take my medicine. Oh no, I take "our" medicine.

---

## WELLER:
I say to hell with them. To hell with all of them.

---

## FONSIA:
That's what I say, too.

---

## WELLER:
Fonsia Dorsey! Your father would roll over in his grave.

---

## FONSIA:
I didn't say it, Weller. You said it.

---

## WELLER:
Do you know what, Mrs. Dorsey? It's almost three o'clock and we haven't amused ourselves yet.


---

## FONSIA:
Oh my goodness …I think I'm feeling faint.

---

## WELLER:
I will amuse you immediately. At our age that could only mean one thing-I'll get the cards.

---

## FONSIA:
Oh, Weller.

---

## WELLER:
A couple of hands of gin, Mrs. Dorsey, and you’ll feel as
good as new.

---


Why don't you try that chair this time?

---

## FONSIA:
Oh, all right. Now, I hope I remember how this goes.

---

## WELLER:
From the way you played last time, I don't think you're going to have any trouble whatsoever. Fonsia, Weller…Fonsia, Weller Fonsia, Weller.

---

## FONSIA:
You know, my family's never called me anything but Fonsie.

---

## WELLER:
Fonsie?

---

## FONSIA:
Yes.

---

## WELLER:
Why would they change Fonsia to Fonsie?

---

## FONSIA:
Beats me.

---

## WELLER:
F-O-N-S-I-A right?

---

## FONSIA:
Yes …you spelled it right.

---

## WELLER:
Fonsia, Fonsie. That's an unusual name.

---

## FONSIA:
I know. I don't have any idea where they got it.


---

## WELLER:
Which do you prefer?

---

## FONSIA:
It don't make any difference to me.

---

## WELLER:
All right…I'll just call you whichever comes to mind
first. How's that?

---

## FONSIA:
That'll be fine.

---

## WELLER:
One, one. Two, two. Three, three…

---

## FONSIA:
Somebody told me "fons" means "source" in Latin, one time,
but -

---

## WELLER:
Four, four…

---

## FONSIA:
I don't know whether that's really -

---

## WELLER:
Five, five. Six, six. Seven, seven. Eight, eight. Nine, nine.
Ten, ten. And eleven for you.

---

## FONSIA:
Now why do I get eleven and you only get ten? I swear I've
forgotten.

---

## WELLER:
That's because I dealt and you'll make the first play…which
will be a discard. Get you cards organized.

---

## WELLER:
All right, now go ahead and discard. O.K., now the game is
underway. You have ten cards and I have ten cards.

---

## FONSIA:
I swear this game relaxes me.

---

## WELLER:
Gin's a very relaxing game. I used to play for hours on
business trips. 

---

I had it all figured out- San Francisco to
Chicago…two Hollywoods.

---



Los Angeles to New York…four Hollywoods. New York to Los
Angeles…five Hollywoods! Headwinds. 

---

You always get headwinds
flying west.

---

## FONSIA:
Well, now. All that time you were playing gin then didn't
seem like you were frittering your life away. 

---

Why should it be any different now?

---

## WELLER:
Well, now. That's a good question. I don't know.

---

## FONSIA:
We don't want to talk about that now, anyway.

---

## WELLER:
Have you played?

---

## FONSIA:
No. I'mjust trying to figure this out.

---

## WELLER:
Well, come on. Play a card.

---

## FONSIA:
All right. I'll knock with three.

---

## WELLER:
You told me you'd never played this game before.

---

## FONSIA:
You explained the part about knocking last week.

---

## WELLER:
Yes, and if I remember correctly, you were rather hazy about
it.

---

## FONSIA:
No, I understood it. I just said I'd stick to the gin part of
the game at first.

---

## WELLER:
Well, I don't think we have to worry about your memory
anymore.

---

## FONSIA:
That was right, wasn't it?


---

## WELLER:
Exceedingly. Ten …twenty…thirty, forty, forty-three, forty six forty-eight!

---

Minus your three gives you forty-five.

---

## FONSIA:
This chair is killing my back. Oh, I sound like Mrs. Leala in there now.

---

## WELLER:
It doesn't seem to be hurting your gin game any.

---

## FONSIA:
I think I'll get that pillow over there and put it behind my back. My soul. 

---

Would you look at that. I can't get over how you shuffle those cards.

---

## WELLER:
It's not that difficult.

---

## FONSIA:
Lord save us - if I tried to do that, the cards would be flying every which way.

---

## WELLER:
One, one. Two, two. Three, three. Four, four. Five, five. Six, six. Seven, seven. 

---

Eight, eight. Nine, nine. Ten, ten. Eleven. What a mess.

---

## FONSIA:
Do you like stewed tomatoes?

---

## WELLER:
No.

---

## FONSIA:
I have never talked to anyone who did.

---

## WELLER:
They serve them often enough around here.

---

## FONSIA:
I can't understand that. With all the wonderful vegetables there are in this world.

---

## WELLER:
Dietitians are not noted for their imaginations.


---

## FONSIA:
Honestly, I think I could do better than that Mrs. Gib… Gibren, Jibran…what is her name?

---

## WELLER:
Gibran.

---

## FONSIA:
Gibran. Gin!

---

## WELLER:
For God's sake, Fonsia, Ijust dealt the cards.

---

## FONSIA:
I know. I got everything I needed right away.

---

## WELLER:
That seems to happen quite a lot to you.

---


Twenty, forty, forty-two…plus twenty-five for gin …gives you
sixty-seven.

---


That puts you out in the first game and gives you a sixty-seven leg
on the second. Goddamn!

---

## FONSIA:
You didn't get any points at all in that game, did you?

---

## WELLER:
No. No, Fonsia, I didn't get any points at all in that game.

---

## FONSIA:
That's too bad.

---

## WELLER:
It's been two weeks now that I haven't won a game.

---

## FONSIA:
Well, I’m sure you’ll win one soon.

---

## WELLER:
I'd say the percentages are definitely starting to favor me.
One, one. Two, two. Three, three. 

---

Four, four. Five, five. Six, six.
Seven, seven. Eight, eight. Nine, nine. Ten, ten. Eleven.


---

## FONSIA:
Goodness. Ijust had the dizziest feeling in my head.

---

## WELLER:
Are you all right?

---

## FONSIA:
Yes. It's gone now. I think it's those pills they're giving
me. I don't think they hit me right.

---

## WELLER:
Do you know what they're giving you?

---

## FONSIA:
I'm not real sure. Seems like it's a different prescription.

---

## WELLER:
You'd better have your doctor check it. I mean your own
doctor-not one of these welfare quacks.

---

## FONSIA:
I'm not here on welfare.

---

## WELLER:
I didn't say that you were. I just said you better have
somebody check that medicine…that's all.

---

## FONSIA:
l didn't mean to jump at you.

---

## WELLER:
Play a card.

---


When you got dizzy just now…did everything seem kind of unreal.
distorted?

---

## FONSIA:
No. Just a dizziness, like I was going to fall off the chair
there for a minute.

---

## WELLER:
Sometimes I'll be sitting in my room…or even out here…and everything will take on a dreamlike quality. 

---

People, the room, everything…like it wasn't really happening.

---

At first I could snap out of it almost immediately. But then, a couple of times, it hit me and I couldn't shake it.

---

This feeling of sheer terror came over me. God, I didn't know what to do. I'd sit there panic stricken, for no reason at all. 

---

People around me would go about their business. I don't think they even knew I was having a problem. And then it would pass.


---

## FONSIA:
That isn't a thing in this world but nerves.

---

## WELLER:
Whose discard?…Is it mine?

---

## FONSIA:
I believe so.

---

## WELLER:
I tell you, it was one of the worst feelings I've ever had in
my life.

---

## FONSIA:
I went through something like that years ago with my divorce.

---

## WELLER:
How'd you get over it?

---

## FONSIA:
Time.

---

## WELLER:
Just time?

---

## FONSIA:
Just time.

---

## WELLER:
Play a card. Well, are you going to play one?

---

## FONSIA:
All right.

---

## WELLER:
I should knock while I've got the chance. You're probably sitting over there with gin already.

---

## FONSIA:
Not quite.

---

## WELLER:
Nothing.
Nothing.
Nothing!


---

## FONSIA:
There it is. Gin!

---

## WELLER:
Goddamnit! Ijust don't know what to say. 

---

I'm stuck with one. You're the luckiest person I've ever seen play gin in my life.

---

## FONSIA:
You could've knocked.

---

## WELLER:
Hindsight's twenty-twenty.

---

## FONSIA:
You would've really gotten me. I was waiting for that queen. I thought I'd never get it.

---

## WELLER:
What?

---

## FONSIA:
I said I thought I'd never get that queen.

---

## WELLER:
Do you mean to tell me that you held queens throughout that
entire hand?

---

## FONSIA:
That's what I'm saying. I had these two queens, so if you had knocked, you would have beaten me. 

---

Now do you see?

---

## WELLER:
Fonsia- that is dumb! That is just dumb gin. Holding a face
card that long. I just can't believe it. 

---

One, one. Two, two. Three,
three. Four, four. Five, five. Six, six. Seven, seven. 

---

Eight, eight.
Nine, nine. Ten, ten. Eleven.

---

## FONSIA:
I won the game, didn't I?

---

## WELLER:
Oh, for God's sake, don't try to relate how you play gin to
the fact that you've won a few games.

---

## FONSIA:
What do you relate it to?


---

## WELLER:
To one of the most incredible runs of luck that I've ever
seen in my life.

---

## FONSIA:
Lord, Weller. I can't help it. Don't shout at me for mercy
sake.

---

## WELLER:
I'm sorry I raised my voice. It's frustration…nothing
more. Just frustration.

---

## FONSIA:
Have you had any of your things turn up missing since you've
been here?

---

## WELLER:
You mean stolen? Damn right I have. A three hundred-dollar
watch.

---

## FONSIA:
My Lord! I never heard that! Did you call the police?

---

## WELLER:
Sure I called the police. They came out here, took my name
and address, and said, "Oh, it happens all the time."

---

## FONSIA:
That's awful. You'd think they could do more than that.

---

## WELLER:
Well, it'd be pretty naive to expect them to come out here
and "solve the case." What are they going to do? Run around
fingerprinting everybody?

---

## FONSIA:
I guess you're right. They've stolen just about everything
they can lay their hands on…but you can't prove a thing.

---

## WELLER:
Of course not. If they paid anything, they might get some
decent help around here. But no…they're too cheap for that.

---

## FONSIA:
Now, Weller. Don't get mad at me…all I've done is sit
here and play the cards the same as you.

---

## WELLER:
Have you got gin again?


---

## FONSIA:
Yes.

---

## WELLER:
Jesus Christ! Do you have to win all the goddamn time? I mean
it! Can't you lose just once?

---

## FONSIA:
Honestly I'm not trying to do this.

---

## WELLER:
Oh, you're not even trying. How reassuring. Oh hell, now I've
forgotten what I was stuck with. 

---

It was a bundle. I'll just call it fifty. Whatever it was, puts you out in the second game.

---

Let's see… fifty would make it seventy-six…plus twenty-five for gin…seventy-six and twenty-five…Goddamn, wait a minute - it couldn't have been fifty. 

---

Must'a been forty. Gives you…ninety-one. Christ, I've never seen anything like it. You're incredible.

---

## FONSIA:
Weller. I don't want to go through this every time I win. I'd
sooner not play.

---

## WELLER:
But look at that. Go to hell.

---

## FONSIA:
I can't help it.

---

## WELLER:
Oh, I get it. You can't help it if I don't know how to play
gin…is that it? Well, let me tell you…

---

## FONSIA:
Weller, I'm going to quit if you keep it up.

---

## WELLER:
Aw no! You're not going to quit on me now.

---

## FONSIA:
Would you like to play cards if someone were shouting at you
all the time?

---

## WELLER:
All right. I'll try to watch my temper.

---


One, one. Two, two. Three, three. Four, four. Five, five. Six, six.


---

Seven,seven. Eight, eight. Nine, nine. Ten, ten. Eleven. But I’ll tell you something, Fonsia. It’s not just me. 

---

This is enough to drive anybody up the wall. Finally, a decent hand.

---

## FONSIA:
I’ve got a good one, too.

---

## WELLER:
You’ve always got a good one.

---

## FONSIA:
You take it too seriously, Weller. Lord, it’s only a game. Oh Lord, Weller.

---

You’re getting so red in the face, I’m afraid something’s going to happen to you.

---

## WELLER:
I get that way sometimes. Look, you’ve got diabetes - I’ve got something else - play a card. 

---

That won’t help.

---

## FONSIA:
I don’t want you to have a stroke right in front of me.

---

## WELLER:
I’ll worry about the stroke. You just worry about your cards.
No help.

---


Any five, any six or the seven clubs. Shit!

---

## FONSIA:
I've got gin!

---

## WELLER:
I don't believe it! Let me see that.
Aw, bullshit! 

---

BULLSHIT!
Jesus Christ. 

---

LOOK AT THAT SHIT!

---

## FONSIA:
Weller!


---

## WELLER:
Jesus Christ Almighty!!

---


INTERMISSION

---

## WELLER:
Never mind. She's probably out here.
Fonsia. Fonsie. 

---

She might be out in the garden. 

---

Fonsie. Fonsie, is
that you out there?

---

## FONSIA:
What is it, Weller?

---

## WELLER:
I wanted to talk to you. It's getting pretty dark out there.
You'd better come in.

---

## FONSIA:
I'll be in, in a little while. Why don't you just go on.

---

## WELLER:
I'll just sit here until you're ready to come in.

---

## FONSIA:
Weller, I just want to be alone for a while - out here…not
in my room.

---

## WELLER:
I didn't mean to disturb you, Fonsia. Honestly, I don't mind
sitting here…waiting.

---

## FONSIA:
No. You're right. It is dark out there now. It was so pretty
before, with all the spring flowers.

---

## WELLER:
Fonsia, I'll get right to the point. I owe you an apology.

---

## FONSIA:
Yes, you do.

---

## WELLER:
All right. Fonsia, I am embarrassed by my own behavior
yesterday and I sincerely apologize.


---

## FONSIA:
I can't _tell whether you're joking or whether you really
mean it.

---

## WELLER:
Of course I mean it. What do you want me to say? 

---

That I behaved like a complete ass? I'm sorry that I upset you, and …I'm just sorry, that's all.

---

## FONSIA:
You frightened me. I don't think you realize how much your
temper affects people.

---

## WELLER:
I'm sure it can be rather awesome at times - but, it's
nothing to be afraid of.

---

## FONSIA:
I don't think I'm so much afraid of what you're going to do
to me. 

---

I just don't know what's going to happen next. When you threw
that table-

---

## WELLER:
Oh, that was nothing. It wasn't directed at·you, anyway.

---

## FONSIA:
It still frightened me.

---

## WELLER:
Fonsie, let's be realistic about this. 

---

Except for the couple of times that I lost my temper, I think we've thoroughly enjoyed each other's company.

---

## FONSIA:
I enjoy your company, Weller…but you can't play gin.

---

## WELLER:
What? What do you mean I can't play gin. Lord, woman, I was
playing gin…

---

## FONSIA:
No, no. No, Weller. I didn't mean you can't play gin. I mean
you can't play without losing your temper.

---

## WELLER:
Jesus. Next thing you know, you'll be thinking you're some
sort of expert, for Christsake.


---

## FONSIA:
My lands, no. Lord knows I'm no expert. I just play like an
expert.

---

## WELLER:
Oh God. Now she's done it.

---

## FONSIA:
Oh, Weller. I was only teasing.

---

## WELLER:
Goddamnit, where are those cards?

---

## FONSIA:
As the Lord is my savior, Weller, I was only teasing you.

---

## WELLER:
Lots of people tease like that. They say exactly what the
hell they mean - then they say, "I was only kidding."
Where's my score pad? 

---

You can't keep anything around this place!

---

## FONSIA:
Now, Weller, I'm not going to play any gin with you.

---

## WELLER:
Oh, come on, Fonsia, for God's sake.
There it is.

---

## FONSIA:
I mean it.

---

## WELLER:
All right then, don't play. 

---

Go on back in there with all
those glassy-eyed old bastards.
Now where's the card table? 

---

Damn it! The card table's gone.

---

## FONSIA:
You shouldn't talk that way about them - you're part of this
thing here, too, you know.

---

## WELLER:
Yeah. Well if that's the case, I'm the part of it that's
breathing. 

---

Don't kid yourself, this isn't anything more than a warehouse for the intellectually and emotionally dead.

---

Nothing more
than a place to store them until their bodies quit.

---

## FONSIA:
God, you're cynical.

---

## WELLER:
It's not cynical. It's a fact, that's all.

---

## FONSIA:
Well, I'm sure glad I don't look at life that way. It's just
the mercy of God that we're able to get around a little better than
they are. 

---

They're just sick, that's all.

---

## WELLER:
They're not half as sick as the ones who put them here. 

---

And
they're not a third as sick as this bunch that's supposed to be
taking care of them.

---

## FONSIA:
Which side of this are you on, anyway? Sometimes I think
you're just looking for a fight.

---

## WELLER:
I'm not looking for a fight - I'm just looking for this
Goddamned card table. Damn it! Where'd they put it?!

---

## FONSIA:
And you've got a horrible temper and a sarcastic streak…

---

## WELLER:
So what? If I were you I wouldn't be talking about anybody
else's shortcomings.

---

## FONSIA:
What's that supposed to mean?

---

## WELLER:
Well neither one of us is winning any popularity contests out
here on visitors' day.

---

## FONSIA:
Oh, I see. No one visits me, so I'm an evil person.

---

## WELLER:
Ya ever hear of Ty Cobb?

---

## FONSIA:
He played baseball.


---

## WELLER:
That's right. Ty Cobb played baseball. He played baseball for
twenty-four years. 

---

You know how many of his teammates showed up for
his funeral? Three! 

---

Kinda makes you think that Ty Cobb may have been
something less than a warm, loving human being, doesn't it?

---

## FONSIA:
Maybe.

---

## WELLER:
Well sir, he's three ahead of us on visitors.

---

## FONSIA:
What are you driving at, Weller?

---

## WELLER:
Why doesn't your son visit you?

---

## FONSIA:
I told you. He lives in Denver. I thought you understood
that.

---

## WELLER:
Then why aren't you in an old age home in Denver? 

---

Or you'd
think at least he'd come here to see that you're comfortable and that
it's a decent-

---

## FONSIA:
I don't want to talk about this anymore. Dance class is ori
tonight, I think I'll go in there with them.

---

## WELLER:
No. Now, wait a minute. You don't want to go in there.

---

## FONSIA:
Why not?

---

## WELLER:
Those people can't dance. Half of them are shuffling around
on walkers, for God's sake.

---

## FONSIA:
And they're all jerks too, I guess.

---

## WELLER:
I never said that. They just can't dance.
There it is! What the hell's it doing over there?


---

## FONSIA:
Well that's what you say about everybody else. I know that's
what you called the Sunshine Ladies.

---

[Barry White Waltz Music Off Stage]

---


## WELLER:
I did not. Now, I may have said that about that bunch that
came out here looking for substitute grandparents. 

---

What'd they call
that?

---

## FONSIA:
Extended family.

---

## WELLER:
That's it! Unitarians. Wanted to psychoanalyze everybody.

---

## FONSIA:
I think they're playing that song I was telling you about.
The one I like so much.

---

## WELLER:
I hear it.

---

## FONSIA:
Maybe I will go in a minute.

---

## WELLER:
All right, damnit, then go ahead. I don't see how you can
stand it in there. 

---

The same damn empty look face after face. You
ought to see them on the days they change the bed linens.

---

Maybe you have. All lined up in their wheelchairs, up and down the halls - like rows of wrinkled pumpkin heads.

---

## FONSIA:
I've seen them.

---

## WELLER:
Jesus Christ! What did they do with this??

---

## FONSIA:
Weller, I wish you wouldn't take the Lord's name so much.

---

## WELLER:
Finally! Goddamnit. ..

---

## FONSIA:
Don't you think it's nice? The music…

---

## WELLER:
It's all right.

---



It goes on too long.

---

## FONSIA:
I thought,you said you liked to dance.

---

## WELLER:
I said "at one time."

---

## FONSIA:
Oh, the cane. I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking.

---

## WELLER:
It's not the cane. I could dance if I wanted to. I just don't
want to.

---


See what I'm talking about. They just keep playing it. And it's so
sappy.

---

## FONSIA:
Oh, I think it's pretty.

---

## WELLER:
Yeah, it's just beautiful.

---

## WELLER:
All right! If you insist. Jesus…

---

## FONSIA:
Oh, you are a good dancer, Weller.

---

## WELLER:
I was.

---

## FONSIA:
You still are.

---

## WELLER:
I'm sorry…my leg. I've got to sit down.

---

## FONSIA:
Oh …are you all right?

---

## WELLER:
Yeah, I'm all right. Damned knee.

---

## FONSIA:
Are you sure?


---

## WELLER:
Yes, I'm sure. I used to dance all night.

---

## FONSIA:
So did I.

---

[Twist Music Off Stage]

---


## WELLER:
I hate that dance class.

---

## FONSIA:
I'll close the door.

---

## WELLER:
Thank you. Well…as long as you're not going in, we might
as well play a little gin.

---

## FONSIA:
I knew that was coming.

---

## WELLER:
Well. What else is there to do?

---

## FONSIA:
Not much, I guess.

---

## WELLER:
Come on - we'11 just play a few hands.

---

## FONSIA:
All right. You're just going to pester me till I do, anyway.

---

## WELLER:
Your chair's right over there. 

---

And would you mind getting the
score pad and pencil? I put them down over there. Thank you.

---

## FONSIA:
I'm so tired of the TV, And all Mrs. Leala wants to talk
about is her funeral arrangements.

---

## WELLER:
You won't find a hotter topic of conversation-I don't care
who you talk to. Not around here.

---

## FONSIA:
My mother was that way. As far as I can remember, funerals
were the only social life she had'. 

---

Well, if this isn't the pot
calling the kettle black. 

---

Here I sit talking about the same thing
they are.


---

## WELLER:
That's what happens when you get too far away from playing
gin. Atrophy. 

---

Next thing you know, you'11 be staring out of the
window all day long.

---

## FONSIA:
Weller, you're imposs-

---

## WELLER:
One, one. Two, two. Three, three. Four, four. Five, five.
Six, six. Seven, seven. 

---

Eight, eight. Nine, nine. Ten, ten. And
eleven for you.

---

## FONSIA:
Now, if I win, don't you shout at me.

---

## WELLER:
Fonsia, I fully expect you to win, and I promise to do my
level best not to rant and rave about it.

---

## FONSIA:
Well, now. I'm going to hold you to that.

---

## WELLER:
I swear, Fonsie, you get yourself upset about the silliest
things.

---

## FONSIA:
Well…

---

## WELLER:
Well, you do.

---

## FONSIA:
Sometimes, I guess. You know, something used to worry me sick
when I was working.

---

## WELLER:
What's that?

---

## FONSIA:
Now, this really is silly. I was always afraid I was going
to misspell a word.

---

## WELLER:
Now there's a novel fear for you.

---

## FONSIA:
It's the truth. I had to work after I divorced Walter. I
worked as an apartment manager. 

---

Course, I didn't have any education
to speak of.


---

## WELLER:
Well, you've got a good mind.

---

## FONSIA:
Still, I was always afraid they'd find out.

---

## WELLER:
Find out what?

---

## FONSIA:
Well, I put down that I had graduated high school.

---

## WELLER:
For the Lord's sake. Who cares whether you graduated from
high school or not. 

---

My God. How old are you, anyway?

---

## FONSIA:
Seventy-one.

---

## WELLER:
Seventy-one. And you're afraid that some one's going to find
out that fifty years ago you didn't graduate with your class? 

---

My God, Fonsia.

---

## FONSIA:
Weller …

---

## WELLER:
You've got gin.

---

## FONSIA:
Yes.

---

## WELLER:
I knew it. I knew it. I'm stuck with eight.

---


You know, when you get gin, you're supposed to put the discard face
down.

---

## FONSIA:
Oh, I'm sorry.

---

## WELLER:
It's no big deal. It's just the way the game is played,
that's all. 

---

Let's see, eight plus twenty-five gives you thirty-three.
And, of course, I get my customary goose-egg.

---

## FONSIA:
Weller, I can't help it. I'm sorry.


---

## WELLER:
Don't be sorry for me, for Christsake.

---

## FONSIA:
I wish you could win one.

---

## WELLER:
You play your best, damnit. I'm not going to have you trying
to lose just to appease poor Weller. 

---

I'm one of the best damn gin
players you'll ever see…

---


One, one. Two, two. Three, three. Four, four. Five, five. Six, six.
Seven, seven. Eight, eight. Nine, nine. 

---

Ten, ten. Eleven…and I sure as hell don't need any help from you.

---

## FONSIA:
All right, Weller. Transferred.

---

## WELLER:
What?

---

## FONSIA:
Transferred!

---

## WELLER:
What the hell are you talking about?

---

## FONSIA:
How many "r's" are there in the word "transferred?"

---

## WELLER:
Transferred…two.

---

## FONSIA:
Hah!

---

## WELLER:
Three? What the hell.

---

## FONSIA:
Three!

---

## WELLER:
Three.

---

## FONSIA:
There are three "r's" in the word "transferred." I had to look that word up every time I spelled it for twenty-five years.


---

Course, you get a lot of people transferred in the apartment
business.


---

## WELLER:
You're not paying any mind to what you're doing.

---

## FONSIA:
Yes, I am too.

---

## WELLER:
You just gave me the jack of hearts.

---

## FONSIA:
Well, I can't use it.

---

## WELLER:
I know. But I picked up a jack not more than thirty seconds
ago. 

---

You knew I was keeping jacks. Now, why'd you give me another
one?

---

## FONSIA:
Because I'm not keeping jacks!

---

## WELLER:
Well, I got the gin.

---


So you'll be pleased to know that your little plan worked.

---

## FONSIA:
What plan? In the name of the Lord.

---

## WELLER:
I told you not to lose on purpose, by God, and I meant it. I
don't need you to let me win.

---

## FONSIA:
I am not letting you win. Oh, I wish you could see yourself
right now, Weller.

---

## WELLER:
Where are you going?

---

## FONSIA:
If you could see yourself, you wouldn't act this way.

---

## WELLER:
I said, where do you think you're going?

---

## FONSIA:
It's late, Weller. I think we should go in.


---

## WELLER:
You sit right back down over there, Fonsia. 

---

We're nowhere
near quitting. In fact, we're just getting started.

---

## FONSIA:
Besides, you said you wouldn't get this way.

---

## WELLER:
I'm not getting any way. 

---

All I'm asking you to do is play the
cards the way you normally would and try to win.

---

## FONSIA:
Weller, I don't like this. I think you should try to see one
of the doctors when they come by.

---

## WELLER:
Hand me those cards over there.

---

## FONSIA:
Maybe the doctor could give you some pills.

---

## WELLER:
I'll worry about the doctors. You just play your cards and
play them right.

---


Fonsia, I'm going to get to the bottom of this. 

---

No. We're going to
get to the bottom of this because you're going to help me. 

---

What we're going to do is…we're going to find out exactly what force is at work here.

---

There's a reason that you constantly draw precisely the
card you need-and you do, come hell or high water, and I'm going to
find out what that force is. 

---

One, one. Two, two. Three,
three. Four, four. Five, five. Six, six. Seven, seven. 

---

Eight, eight.
Nine, nine. Ten, ten. Eleven.

---

## FONSIA:
Weller, I'm not feeling well.

---

## WELLER:
Play your cards, damnit! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Please play
your cards.

---

## FONSIA:
This is ridiculous.

---

## WELLER:
I don't care if it's ridiculous or not. Discard. 

---

All right.
Now I'll discard and Fonsia'll pick it up, won't you?

---

She did. I told you she would. Didn't I tell you she would.

---

## FONSIA:
Weller, who are you talking to?

---

## WELLER:
To myself. To me and my little man.

---


You see, there's a little man sitting right there. 

---

Now, I'll discard
and it's going to be the exact card that Fonsia wants.

---


What did I tell you! Christi She controls my mind.

---

## FONSIA:
Oh, Lord.

---

## WELLER:
This time I'll trick her. I'm going to discard this card…
and, no. 

---

At the last moment I change my mind and discard this card.
And she doesn't take it. 

---

By God, I think I've found the answer.
You've been reading my mind, haven't you, Fonsia? 

---

What are you? Some
sort of witch? No, that's not it. I know what it is. 

---

Divine
intervention. That's what it is. 

---

Divine intervention.

---

## FONSIA:
Weller, stop it.

---

## WELLER:
Well, it is, isn't it?

---

## FONSIA:
It's late. I think we should go in.

---

## WELLER:
You've got it, haven't you? You've got gin.

---

## FONSIA:
No, Weller. I don't have gin.

---

## WELLER:
You've got to say so when you get it, now. 

---

I'll be damned if
I want you sitting over there with gin in your hand just waiting for
me to go out.

---

## FONSIA:
Believe me, I'll tell you. I need one more card. And when I
get it, I'll tell you.


---

## WELLER:
Well, sir. You won't be getting anymore help from me.

---

## FONSIA:
Well, I got it. There it is- gin. Now can we quit?

---

## WELLER:
Who gave you that card? I want to know who gave you that
card!

---

God gave you that card, didn't he? Didn't God give you that card?

---

## FONSIA:
Yes, Weller. God gave me that card.

---

## WELLER:
Don't you patronize me, you bitch.

---

## FONSIA:
Just who do you think you're talking to, MAN.

---

## WELLER:
All right, all right. I shouldn't have called you that.

---

## FONSIA:
I'll not sit here and have you call me names.

---

## WELLER:
No. No. Don't go. I said I was sorry. Now that ought to be
enough.

---

## FONSIA:
I've had enough of this whole thing.

---

## WELLER:
I said, don't go.

---

## FONSIA:
I'm going to call one of the nurses.

---

## WELLER:
Nol Nol Wait a minute. What would you want to do that for?
Call one of the nurses. 

---

What are you going to tell the nurse? …
"I'm being held hostage by a maniac who's forcing me to play gin?"

---

## FONSIA:
Well, I ought to tell her something.


---

## WELLER:
One more hand. I promise. Just one more hand.

---

## FONSIA:
This is so upsetting.

---

## WELLER:
If I can just get these damned cards straightened up. What
the hell's the score? 

---

Fonsia-a thousand…ten thousand. Oh, screw
it.

---


Look. We'll play this one more hand.Just this one, and then we'll
quit. Come on, Fonsie. I promise. 

---

This will be the last hand.
One, one. Two, two. Three, three. 

---

Four, four…Five, five. Six, six.
Seven, seven. Eight, eight. Nine, nine. Ten, ten. Eleven.

---

## FONSIA:
I hope this is quick.

---

## WELLER:
You mean I didn't deal you a perfect hand? I must be slipping.

---

## FONSIA:
Just play your cards, Weller.

---

## WELLER:
“Just play your cards, Weller." My, aren't we getting tough.

---

## FONSIA:
Not tough. Just tired. Very tired.

---

## WELLER:
Well, all you have to do …Goddamnit. 

---

All you have to do is
win this one real quick and we can go in.

---


Son-of-a-bitch. I'm talking about the cards.

---

## FONSIA:
No, you're not.

---

## WELLER:
Aw, for Christsake, come on. Goddamnit.


---

## FONSIA:
Every second breath you draw has to be a curse word, doesn't
it.

---

## WELLER:
Shit! Say it! You've got it, goddamnit. Say it!
SAY IT!

---

## FONSIA:
Gin.

---

## WELLER:
Oh, for Christsake, you can say it louder than that. I can
hardly even hear you!

---

## FONSIA:
GIN, GODDAMNIT! GIN!

---

## WELLER:
All right! Now we can go in.

---

[Transiton D&E Music]

## FONSIA:
Mrs. Mayes just told me my sister Hattie was out here on the porch - came to see me.

---

## WELLER:
I thought you said she lived in Ottawa.

---

## FONSIA:
I did.

---

## WELLER:
Well sir, no one's been out here.

---

## FONSIA:
I didn't expect there would be.

---

## WELLER:
How've you been?

---

## FONSIA:
Mrs. Mayes isn't all that clever, you know.

---

## WELLER:
Oh, you can't pay any attention to anything she says. 

---

She
doesn't even know what's going on half the time.

---

## FONSIA:
Oh, she got the message straight all right.


---

## WELLER:
What am I supposed to say?

---

## FONSIA:
She said, "Mr. Martin told me to tell you that your sister's
waiting on the porch."

---

## WELLER:
Oh, I didn't tell her any such thing.

---

## FONSIA:
Who the Harry do you think you're kidding, Weller? 

---

Do you
suppose I'd believe that? 

---

A sister I haven't seen for fifteen years-I
would come out here looking for her?

---

## WELLER:
Well, you didn't believe it-so what the hell are you
complaining about?

---

## FONSIA:
It's disgusting that you would go that far just to get me out
here.

---

## WELLER:
I don't give a damn if you never come out here.

---

## FONSIA:
Oh, yes you do. I know why you want me out here. 

---

It's that
blasted card game. You just can't get that off your mind.

---

## WELLER:
I haven't asked you to play all week, have I?

---

## FONSIA:
I haven't talked to you all week.

---

## WELLER:
So what! I could've asked you to play- if I was so all fired
hot about it.

---

## FONSIA:
It's been on your mind…I can tell that.

---

## WELLER:
What's so strange about that? Does that make me some sort of
nut?

---

## FONSIA:
You just can't drop it. It was a game, Weller. You lost. It's
over. So forget it.


---

## WELLER:
Well…suppose I do want to play you again.

---

## FONSIA:
Nothing doing. The minute you lost, it'd be the same thing
all over again. I may be old, but I'm not crazy.

---

## WELLER:
I'm not crazy, either.

---

## FONSIA:
I've never seen a man get so wild over a game of cards in my
life. It's not natural, Weller. 

---

There's something wrong.

---

## WELLER:
Oh, I know all about how you think there's something wrong
with me. 

---

They called me down to the office last Tuesday to tell me
they were thinking of having a psychiatrist come out here and talk
to me. 

---

Do you know what they could do if he says there's something
wrong with my mind? They could have me committed to the State Mental
Hospital. 

---

The very fact that you complained makes me a troublemaker.

---

## FONSIA:
You could need help and not know it. There's such a thing as
that, you know. All I was trying to do was help you.

---

## WELLER:
Goddamnit, I don't need your help. And don't you go judging
me.

---

## FONSIA:
All right…suit yourself. I just felt as long as you've got
some money, it wouldn't hurt to have you talk to someone who might be
able…

---

## WELLER:
Got some money? Who told you I had money?

---

## FONSIA:
Well, you did. You had your own business and you did well, I
thought. 

---

Flying around the country, I just assumed…

---

## WELLER:
Oh hell, I did do well. You're right. I built that Goddamn
business. 

---

And if I'd had a little better luck with my business partners, I'd probably still have it.

---

Christ, I was literally thrown out of my own business.

---

## FONSIA:
How could they do that? Didn't you get anything?


---

## WELLER:
It's too complicated. Yes, I had some money. 

---

I had over a
hundred thousand dollars. But I made the mistake of getting sick.


---

Then I made the mistake of getting well. I stayed at Belair
Convalescent two and-a-half years after my heart attack. 

---

Then I had a relapse-had to go to the hospital for four days and those bastards at Belair wouldn't hold my bed.

---

I didn't have any money left so they didn't have to take me back. I was placed here. Placed!

---

By some lowly, brainless bastard at the welfare department.

---

And now you're trying to have me declared some sort of personality problem around here.

---

## FONSIA:
Maybe I shouldn't have said anything. No, if I didn't say something, the next thing you know they'd find one of us out here on the floor.

---

## WELLER:
Oh, Fonsia, don't be ridiculous.

---

## FONSIA:
You may think it's ridiculous but I'm the one that's getting
shouted at and pushed around. 

---

And the way you look at me when you get
like that. I don't know what you might do.

---

## WELLER:
What do you think I'm going to do? Hit you over the head?

---

## FONSIA:
I just don't know

---

## WELLER:
You just don't know. Good God, you make harsh judgments,
Fonsia. 

---

I'm a potential murderer. I'm crazy, I'm vulgar. 

---

According to
you I'm a hopeless sinner for taking the Lord's name all the time.

---


I'm dishonest in business…

---

## FONSIA:
I never said that.

---

## WELLER:
What?

---

## FONSIA:
That you were dishonest in business.

---

## WELLER:
The hell you didn't. Remember the guy who paid me four
thousand …


---

## FONSIA:
No, you said yourself it was only worth five hundred.

---

## WELLER:
I said it was worth whatever he was willing to pay.

---

## FONSIA:
Well, you're the one who has to live with it.

---

## WELLER:
You know what's wrong with most of the people in the world
today? They have a mother who's just like you.

---

## FONSIA:
That is the most insulting remark I have ever heard in my
life.

---

## WELLER:
God. I'll bet your son has had a hard time of it.

---

## FONSIA:
Weller, that's personal and it's none of your business.

---

## WELLER:
I know why Larry doesn't visit you. I know why now…

---

## FONSIA:
Weller…

---

## WELLER:
It doesn't have a damn thing to do with Denver, or distance,
or job or anything else like that. 

---

I know what it is now. 

---

You've made
him feel like the lowest piece of crap on earth for so long he can't
stand the sight of you. 

---

He hates you.

---

## FONSIA:
That's not true! And I won't have you talk to me like that!

---

## WELLER:
He's never done anything right, has he? He's never done a
thing in this world to please you, has he?

---

## FONSIA:
Stop it, Weller. I'm warning you.

---

## WELLER:
He doesn't even live in Denver, does he?

---

## FONSIA:
Well, that is the craziest thing I have ever heard in my
life.


---

## WELLER:
You are guilty of lying. Fonsia is a liar, because your son
lives right here in town…and you know it.

---

## FONSIA:
He does not hate me. He doesn't hate me.

---

## WELLER:
Then why doesn't he visit you? Why does he totally ignore his
own mother?

---

## FONSIA:
He …he just doesn't bother, I guess. He just doesn't
bother. How did you know he lives here?

---

## WELLER:
I didn't. I was guessing.

---

## FONSIA:
Guessing?

---

## WELLER:
Yes. Guessing.

---

## FONSIA:
Guessing! You bastard! You bastard! I hate you…

---

## WELLER:
Fonsie. Fonsie. Fonsie. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Lord, it's getting cold out here. 

---

It's getting darker, too. That
storm's coming closer.

---

## FONSIA:
Weller…I did lie to you. I'm on welfare, too.

---

## WELLER:
I guess we just lived too long, Fonsia.

---

## FONSIA:
I had a little money. 

---

But with the hospital bills and trying
to look after myself…plus I still had that little house on Ash
Street I was trying to run. 

---

Of course, you can't expect your
children to give up their lives. 

---

But I fixed his wagon on that
house, by God. That went straight to the Presbytery.

---

## WELLER:
Oh. Well, I didn't mean all that I said before.


---

## FONSIA:
They can do whatever they want with it. But it's one thing he
won't get.

---

## WELLER:
Here comes the rain.

---

## FONSIA:
I know who he takes after. His father was as rotten as they
come. 

---

I did hope that Larry'd be differ nt. And after all I did for
him, what's he up and do about five years ago but try and look up
his father! 

---

"Over my dead body," I told him. ''You do that and
you've seen the last of me!" 

---

Sometimes I think he does hate me. I
don't know.

---

## WELLER:
You're just getting yourself all upset, Fonsia. There isn't a
thing in the world you can do.

---

## FONSIA:
I know. I shouldn't get this way.

---

## WELLER:
Try to relax yourself. You're only doing yourself harm. 

---

What
you need is to get your mind off him.

---


I hope that didn't hit the home! No. 

---

I guess it just hit a power line
or something.

---


What the hell is that? The roof's leaking again! They were supposed
to have renovated this place five years ago, and look at that! The
Goddamn roof leaks.

---


The walls are so damn thin you can punch your finger right through
them. The heat doesn't work. 

---

This is a Goddamn slum. That's what it
is. A Goddamn slum. It's falling apart.

---


Look at that! There's a perfect example of exactly what I'm talking
about. 

---

That switch is on there at damned near a forty-five-degree
angle.

---


I don't know how drunk a man would have to be to think that's
straight up and down.


---

## FONSIA:
I know it's so.

---

## WELLER:
I guess it's going to rain all afternoon.

---

## FONSIA:
I think so…

---

## WELLER:
Well, come on. I'll play you a hand of gin.

---

## FONSIA:
You know, Weller. You can be such an enjoyable person to be
with. 

---

You've got a wonderful sense of humor …If it wasn't for that
damned gin game.

---

## WELLER:
My goodness, Fonsia. Such language.

---

## FONSIA:
Weller, I've played all the cards I'm going to play.

---

## WELLER:
I'm not going to argue with you, Fonsia. We're playing gin.

---

## FONSIA:
That's it, Weller. You're not going to drop this gin game
business, and I'm not going to play. 

---

So there's no reason for us to
sit here and argue about it. I'll just go on in.

---

## WELLER:
You stay right where you are.

---

## FONSIA:
It's the only thing I know to do.

---

## WELLER:
What do you mean, it's the only thing you know to do? You
came out here, didn't you?

---

## FONSIA:
Yes, I did. But certainly not to play gin. All I wanted-

---

## WELLER:
All you wanted was to manipulate me. We've been playing your
game…now we're going to play mine.


---

## FONSIA:
I'm not even going to get into this with you, Weller.

---

## WELLER:
The hell you're not. You knew your sister Hattie wasn't out
here. 

---

You saw through my little plan to get you out here and you came
out anyway. You can't tell me you didn't enjoy beating me game after
game. 

---

Watching me get angrier and angrier.

---

## FONSIA:
Taking a chance on Lord knows what kind of violence.

---

## WELLER:
Don't be ridiculous.

---

## FONSIA:
I don't think I am being ridiculous when I say that. 

---

When you
lose that temper of yours, I think you're capable of anything.

---

## WELLER:
Will you get off that, for Christsake, and come back over
here and sit down.

---

## FONSIA:
No, Weller. I'm going in.

---

## WELLER:
I'm not going to let you go in there. You'll tell them I'm
crazy.

---

## FONSIA:
Let me go! Take your hands off me!

---

## WELLER:
Quiet, for Christsake, they'll hear you!

---

## FONSIA:
I hope they do.

---

## WELLER:
You do, don't you? You'd love to get in there and tell them
I've been out here shouting at you again. 

---

That'd do the trick.
Vindictive! That's what you are. Vindictive! 

---

Screwed your own son out
of that house just to get even with him-for God knows what reason.

---

## FONSIA:
That's my business, Goddamnit! And you can just shut up about
it. Who do you think you are, anyway. 

---

Maybe I had good reason for
what I did. You just don't know the situation. 

---

All you care about in this world is that damned gin game. You're the one who's so vindictive.

---

Saying anything to me,just because I won’t play.

---

## WELLER:
Sit down! Sit down!

---

## FONSIA:
Goddamn you! All right! Goddamn you.

---

## WELLER:
We'll play one hand and you play to win, Goddamnit!

---

## FONSIA:
Don't you worry about that, mister!

---

## WELLER:
All right. This is it! This is the game!

---

## FONSIA:
Deal!

---

## WELLER:
One.
One! One. Two, two. Three, three. Four, four. Five, five. Six, six.

---

## WELLER:
ONSIA ….Seven, seven. Eight, eight. Nine, nine. Ten, ten.
Eleven.

---

## WELLER:
I'm going to beat you this hand…By God, I'm going to beat
you.

---

## FONSIA:
I don't know what makes you think it's going to be
any different this time.

---

## WELLER:
Don't you get smart with me.

---

[Choir Singing "Here I Am Lord" Off Stage]

---


## FONSIA:
I'm not getting smart. It's the truth. 

---

If you played this
game so well, you would have beaten me long ago.

---

## WELLER:
Shut up, Goddamnit! I'll show you who's going to win. You
just concentrate on your cards.

---

## FONSIA:
It's your discard.

---

## WELLER:
I know it's my discard.


---

## FONSIA:
I hope you do lose. I hope you lose so badly…God.

---

## WELLER:
Jesus Christ, another choir. That's all we need is another
choir.

---


Why don't you pick up my discard and gin on me? You can't do it, can
you? 

---

It's going to take more than luck this time.

---

## FONSIA:
You have to be the victim of bad luck, don't you, Weller.

---

## WELLER:
Play a card.

---

## FONSIA:
Because if it wasn't bad luck, it'd have to be something
else, wouldn't it?

---

## WELLER:
I said, play a card.

---

## FONSIA:
It'd have to be something like maybe you think you play this
game a whole lot better than you really play it.

---

## WELLER:
Goddamnit, Fonsia. You're asking for it.

---

## FONSIA:
If it hadn't been bad luck with your business partners, then
it would've had to been bad judgment

---

…or worse yet maybe they were
simply better businessmen than you were.

---

## WELLER:
You shut your fucking mouth! You don't know the first thing
about it.

---

## FONSIA:
Don't you use that word in my presence!

---

## WELLER:
I'll use any fucking word I please.

---

## FONSIA:
You're just like the one I got. A filthy foul mouth. 

---

There I
was with a two-year-old baby listening to such filth.

---

## WELLER:
I'm sure he had a damned good reason for using it.


---

## FONSIA:
I fixed his wagon. He came home one night with half a load
on, and I had everything he owned right on the street. 

---

I mean, right on the street! And that was the end of that!

---

## WELLER:
I would've knocked your damned teeth in.

---

## FONSIA:
Yes. And I would have had you in jail so fast it would have
made your head spin.

---

## WELLER:
Bullshit!

---

## FONSIA:
Don't you think I wouldn't. Besides, Walter was too much of a
coward to do that anyway.

---

## WELLER:
You don't have too many kind things to say about the men in
your life, do you?

---

## FONSIA:
I'll admit it. When it comes to men, I've been very unlucky.

---

## WELLER:
You've been what?

---

## FONSIA:
I haven't had much success.

---

## WELLER:
You've been unlucky!

---

## FONSIA:
All right!

---

## WELLER:
Sounds like you've been having the same kind of bad luck
you've been telling me about. 

---

It had to be bad luck, because if it
wasn't bad luck, it would've had to been the fact that maybe it was
you! 

---

That maybe you're a rigid, self-righteous, vicious…

---

## FONSIA:
All right! You made your point. Just be quiet and play the
cards.

---

## WELLER:
You want this one. This is one of the ones you want. And I'm
going to have to give it to you, too. Damnit!


---

## FONSIA:
Well, that was stupid. You gave me a (queen) three plays ago.
I'll take it.

---

## WELLER:
I didn't have any choice, idiot!

---

## FONSIA:
Don't you call me an idiot. Don't you ever call me an idiot,
you…you
fuck!

---


I have never said that word in my life.

---

## WELLER:
Play a card.

---

## FONSIA:
All right! God damn you.

---

## WELLER:
Now! Now, we'll see who's stupid. One card. One card. Now,
we'll see who's an idiot.

---

## FONSIA:
Shut your mouth.

---

## WELLER:
Be it. Be it. Be it. Goddamn. So close.

---

## FONSIA:
Gin.

---

## WELLER:
Gin?

---

## FONSIA:
Gin!

---

## WELLER:
Gin. GIN!

---

## FONSIA:
Don't hit me, Weller! For God's sake!
Nurse! Nurse!


---

## WELLER:
Gin! Gin! Gin! Gin! Gin! Gin! Gin!

---


(Weller Screams)

---

## FONSIA:
Weller…

---

[Choir Singing "Here I Am Lord" Crescendos]

---

## FONSIA:
Oh, no.
