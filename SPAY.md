## HARPER:
Are you thirsty? You’re probably dehydrated.
---
## NOAH:
Naw, nope. Just achey, I’m fine.
---
## HARPER:
I read that you’d get dehydrated.
---
## NOAH:
I don’t feel thirsty.
---
template: overlap
## HARPER:
Dehydrated and thirsty are different.

## NOAH:
Don’t feel dehydrated neither.
---
## HARPER:
Either.
---
## NOAH:
What?
---
## HARPER:
Not neither.
---
## NOAH:
Oh my Lord Harper.
---
template: overlap
## HARPER:
Just, siddown and I’ll tend to you in a minute.

## NOAH:
Don’t need tending to.
---
## HARPER:
Ohhhkay.
---
## HARPER:
Are you cold?
---
## NOAH:
Did you read I’d get cold?
---
## HARPER:
You’re shaking, I can see you shaking, 
---
you were shaking the whole way home.
---
## NOAH:
Yeah well it’s not cause I’m cold 
---
it’s like a thousand degrees in here.
---
## HARPER:
Didn’t know, which is why I asked.
---
## NOAH:
Which is why I’m sayin no.
---
## HARPER:
Great.
---
## NOAH:
Yeah, great.
---
## HARPER:
This is really how you’re gonna act right now?
---
## NOAH:
I’m probably just dehydrated.
---
## HARPER:
Really, Noah? 
---
This is how you treat me after these past eighteen hours? 
---
After I spend the night at Memorial,
---
awake the whole time by the way,
---
to make sure you’re still alive?
--- 
## NOAH:
Okay okay okay I’m sorry but everything hurts, 
---
I feel like crap, I didn’t ask you for any of–
---
## HARPER:
You’re the one who wanted to come to my home, 
---
wanted to have a talk.
---
## NOAH:
I did, 
I do, 
---
my mind’s just everywhere and I need a minute–
---
## HARPER:
Well, take your minute on the couch and drink some water. 
---
We’re talking here, I’m not hauling you over to Jackson’s.
---
## NOAH:
He can come by later, pick me up.
---
## HARPER:
Wasn’t he gonna “come by” the hospital at some point?
---
## NOAH:
He got busy.
---
## HARPER:
Busy, oh.
---
## NOAH:
I know. That you’re mad.
---
## HARPER:
Good start.
---
## NOAH:
Quit talking to me like I’m some kind of lowlife–
---
## HARPER:
Oh, you’re gonna get people in this town calling you a lowlife, 
---
people in this town who know a
whole lot of lowlives 
---
and even maybe are lowlives but still managed to not overdose 
---
in front of a bunch of children 
---
at a kindergarten baseball game.
---
## NOAH:
I know. I know. 
---
I know I know I know I’m sorry.
---
## HARPER:
Oh you’re sorry? 
---
Oh good. Oh that helps.
---
## NOAH:
Can we just. Start this over. 
---
We don’t have to talk about the game right away.
---
## HARPER:
The game’s all anyone’s gonna want to talk about, 
---
even in Williamson, you really outdid yourself with–
---
## NOAH:
I know I fucked up.
---
## HARPER:
Do not curse in my home, a child lives here.
---
## NOAH:
Benny’s not home. Wait where’s Benny?
---
## HARPER:
Now you ask where’s Benny.
---
He’s at the McMann’s, they took him after the game. 
---
Slept without his special blanket, 
---
so he’ll be a mess today.
---
## NOAH:
I’m sorry you had to send him away.
---
## HARPER:
Wouldn’t be safe to have him here, so.
---
## NOAH:
Benny’ll always be safe around me.
---

## HARPER:
[laughs]

## NOAH:
Don’t laugh I’m serious.
---
## HARPER:
A public park with a bunch of six-year-olds 
---
playing a game of–
---
## NOAH:
I wasn’t planning to.
---
## HARPER:
Well. Spontaneous or otherwise, 
---
what you do affects people, Noah, 
---
here I am waiting to see if
you live through the night 
---
and I’ve got voicemails from the principal saying we need to talk
---
and there’s a headline about you 
---
on the Daily’s website getting shared all over the Internet
---
and none of that even matters compared to the fact that: 
---
Because of you. 
---
A whole team of children. Is traumatized.
---
These kids are surviving, 
---
this is a survival town is where we’re at, Noah. 
---
I got three kids whose parents died this year. 
---
I’ve got kids who come in hungry 
---
and kids who wear the same clothes each day, 
---
but the school can give them this one small thing, 
---
this game, this afternoon where
they’re safe and they’re happy 
---
and they’ve got grown-ups paying attention to them, 
---
cheering them on. And then–
---
## NOAH:
I know.
---
## HARPER:
You almost died. 
---
You looked dead, 
---
those kids thought they watched you die.
---
## NOAH:
I was never gonna–
---
## HARPER:
I’m sure you’ve never actually watched an overdose, Noah, 
---
but it’s not a pretty sight, all
---
twitching and slumped over the bleachers 
---
with your eyes rolled back in your head–
---
## NOAH:
Stop.
---
## HARPER:
The looks people gave me, 
---
like I was– contaminated, somehow–
---
## NOAH:
Look, sorry if I embarrassed you, 
---
is that what you want me to–?
---
## HARPER:
Embarrassed is the last thing on my mind. 
---
Had to call an ambulance, 
---
I don’t even know what that bill’s gonna look like 
---
but what I do know’s a kindergarten teacher salary 
---
won’t be paying it off anytime soon, 
---
that’s for dang sure–
---
## NOAH:
I was fine by the time they got there!
---
## HARPER:
You used in front of Benny.
---
My, our Benny.
---
## NOAH:
I didn’t. 
Think he’d be there.
---
## HARPER:
He wants to join the school team when he gets to kindergarten, 
---
I bring him to all the games, 
---
don’t you ask him about anything?
---
## NOAH:
Oh do not start with me on Benny 
---
you give me a Sunday a month.
---
## HARPER:
I give you more than you have proven you can handle.
---
## NOAH:
I am his I am his mother.
---
## HARPER:
We’re not playing that game.
---
## NOAH:
You act like he ain’t mine, like–
---
## HARPER:
I act as his guardian, 
---
you made me his guardian.
---
I have to make hard decisions for his own good, 
---
and I’ve been lenient this far, 
---
but I can’t keep living on promises you don’t keep.
---
## NOAH:
What’re you even–
---
## HARPER:
I thought about it in the ambulance 
---
and the hospital 
---
and the whole way back 
---
and I can’t have you around Benny anymore, 
---
I will not be our mother 
---
and I will not raise a child around a junkie.
---
## NOAH:
Okay okay Jesus, I get it, 
---
it won’t happen again.
---
## HARPER:
I’m serious. 
---
I’m cutting you off.
---
## NOAH:
You can’t do that. 
---
Wait you can’t do that.
---
## HARPER:
I can 
---
and I think Child Protective Services can legally enforce that. 
---
Kinship adoptions can become closed adoptions real quick, 
---
and they do, all the time.
---
## NOAH:
But it was just it was one time 
---
it was one mistake 
---
I’ve followed your rules 
---
I’ve been good clean 
---
every time I seen him for the last year–
---
## HARPER:
He’s not a baby anymore, 
---
he remembers everything he sees here on out.
---
## NOAH:
I know how old he is.
---
## HARPER:
He asked if Auntie Noah was sick again. 
---
He asked if he could give you his special blanket 
---
to help you get better.
---
## NOAH:
I’m an hour out of the hospital 
---
I still got the stupid bracelet on 
---
and you’re gonna tell me you’re takin my kid away from me?
---
## HARPER:
Noah.
---
## NOAH:
You don’t get it 
---
look at me in the face 
---
I am telling you I’m gonna get clean for real 
---
it’ll be
different this time. 
---
I’ve been good with Sunday dinners 
---
I ain’t missed one since last year, 
---
I’ve done everything you told me to and–
---
Look at me, Harps.
---
## NOAH:
If I don’t get to see him grow 
---
I don’t know what I’ll do with myself.
---
Please. I mean it this time, I’ll change, 
---
I’ll be better, I’ll do anything.
---
## HARPER:
Prove it.
---
## NOAH:
Prove it?
---
## HARPER:
You mean it this time, give me action items, 
---
make a list. Now.
---
## NOAH:
Does that mean you’ll let me–
---
## HARPER:
List, now.
---
## NOAH:
I’ll… up my hours at Waffle House. 
---
I’ll send you my schedule so you always know where I am.
---
## HARPER:
Good, fine. What else?
---
## NOAH:
I’ll I’ll look into methadone clinics.
---
## HARPER:
Would Williamson Comp take you back?
---
## NOAH:
There’s a new one in Chattaroy if they won’t.
---
## HARPER:
I’ll look into it, what else?
---
## NOAH:
I’ll ask around about Suboxone.
---
## HARPER:
You’ll see Dr. Kierney about Suboxone, nothing illegal.
---
## NOAH:
Haven’t seen Dr. Kierney since I was sixteen.
---
## HARPER:
You’ll see him now.
---
## NOAH:
Yeah sure okay.
---
## HARPER:
You’ll move back in with me and Benny, 
---
at least for a while. 
---
You’ll stay here, on the couch,
---
there’ll be rules but you’ll stay here 
---
so I can take care of you. 
---
You’re gonna let me take care of you.
---
## NOAH:
I can play with Benny?
---
## HARPER:
With my supervision. What else?
---
## NOAH:
I don’t– I can’t think of.
---
## HARPER:
If you’re going to keep the relationship you’ve got with Benny, I need more from you. 
---
I need it to be harder for you to make a mistake, 
---
to even have the option to use–
---
## NOAH:
I could break up with Jackson. I WILL.
---
## NOAH:
I mean. If I’m already staying here for a while.
---
## HARPER:
Yeah?
---
## NOAH:
Son of a bitch didn’t even show up at the hospital. 
---
Had tubes in my nose to breathe and shit
---
and he didn’t even show.
---
## HARPER:
The cursing’s gotta stop.
---
## NOAH:
Sorry.
---
## HARPER:
You’ll break up with Jackson.
---
## NOAH:
Says he loves me and didn’t even show.
---
## HARPER:
You’ll break up with Jackson?
---
## NOAH:
Yeah. 
Yes.
---
## HARPER:
You won’t buy from Jackson?
---
## NOAH:
Wouldn’t be able to get it for free anymore, so.
---
## HARPER:
Is that supposed to be a joke?
---
## NOAH:
I can still be funny.
---
I can still– I’m me, okay?
---
## HARPER:
You’re alright.
---
## NOAH:
I know it’s bad. 
---
I know I messed up.
---
## HARPER:
I know you know.
---
## NOAH:
I was clean for nine months, remember? 
---
I did it, I could do it again.
---
## HARPER:
I know you could. 
---
It’s why I push you hard.
---
## NOAH:
You called me a junkie. 
---
You think I’m a junkie?
---
## HARPER:
No. I think you have a disease.
---
## NOAH:
Don’t know if I’d rather be a junkie or diseased.
---
## HARPER:
Drink your water.
---
---
## NOAH:
[yelps]
---
## NOAH:
God-damned motherfucker son of a bitch.

Hi, baby.

You saw my face, now you can go.

## JACKSON:
Did you think you could just up and leave me without talking about it? 
---
You disappear for two days

and I don’t knock on no doors asking questions?

## NOAH:
You disappeared at the game.

## JACKSON:
You know how much product I had on me, baby,

## NOAH:
I was damn near dead.

## JACKSON:
You wasn’t gonna–

Harper was there,

no way you die under Harper’s watch.

## NOAH:
You knew Harper was there?
---
## JACKSON:
–It ain’t that big of a park. We waved.
---
## NOAH:
I don’t remember.
---
## JACKSON:
You were floating ten feet high, time we got there.
---
## NOAH:
And you let me do more?!
---
## JACKSON:
I don’t let you do nothing, 
---
you pay for the product 
---
and you’re a grown-ass adult can do 
---
what she wants!

## NOAH:
I’m a grown-ass adult dating your childish self and you let me OD.

## JACKSON:
You think I’m a scientist or something?

Shoot, baby, I didn’t know you’d tweak out like that.
---
## NOAH:
Gee, Jackson, you know how to say just what a girl wants to hear.
---
## JACKSON:
Baby, I’m all tripped-up nerves and Red Bull brain right now, 
---
I can’t help sayin the wrong things. 
---
I shouldn’t’ve left the game, that’s why you’re mad. 
---
I get it now.
---
## NOAH:
You up and left, 
---
I up and left, we’re even.
---
## JACKSON:
I don’t wanna be even, 
---
I want you to gimme a kiss and come home.
---
## NOAH:
I’m staying with Harper now.
---
## JACKSON:
Why’d you wanna do a thing like that?
---
## NOAH:
She wants me to.
---
## JACKSON:
And you?
---
## NOAH:
Don’t matter.
---
## JACKSON:
Matters to me if you’re dumping me or your sister is.
---
## NOAH:
I am.
---
## JACKSON:
Why?
---
## NOAH:
Don’t gotta tell you why.
---
## JACKSON:
She treats you like a kid, 
---
like she’s your momma and she’s–

## NOAH:
She’s scared for me. Bout how bad it’s got.
---
## JACKSON:
What, cause a’the game?
---
## NOAH:
Benny was there.
---
## JACKSON:
I know, I said we waved!
---
## NOAH:
You knew he was there?

## JACKSON:
I mean Harper does her damnedest to keep me hid from him

but I still know what the boy
looks like.

He’s got your smile, your ears,

Get out.

Wait what?

We both saw’m!

## NOAH:
I barely knew where the hell I was.

## JACKSON:
You knew and you didn’t care 
---
so don’t go around acting all high and mighty 
---
like I’m the reason you’re–
---
## NOAH:
I wouldn’t be hooked if it weren’t for you.
---
## JACKSON:
We ain’t doin this.
---
## NOAH:
Cause you know I’m right, that’s why.

## JACKSON:
Baby, I met you, you were hooked!
---
## NOAH:
I was takin my mom’s Oxy, it wasn’t–

## JACKSON:
You wanted it 
---
so you got it from me, 
---
that my fault? 
---
We’re talkin about Williamson here, 
---
I’m not the only one could sell shit t’you, 
---
only difference is mine’s pure.
---
## NOAH:
Well, I can’t date my dealer anymore 
---
I need to be done with all this.
---
## JACKSON:
All this?
---
It’s me, baby. 
---
I’m your Jackson.
---
## NOAH:
Stoppit.
---
## JACKSON:
I’m your big spoon. 
---
It’s me you’re talkin to, 
---
look at me.
---
## NOAH:
I can’t, 
---
I can’t do all this, 
---
I’m not in good sorts enough to–
---
## JACKSON:
Harper doesn’t know how to make you happy, 
---
you barely know how, 
---
I’ve been workin at it for four years.
---
## NOAH:
On-off, it’s more like three.
---
## JACKSON:
Since we was sixteen years old, 
---
doesn’t that mean somethin to you?
---
## NOAH:
Please, quit, 
---
this ain’t what I

## JACKSON:
Ain’t what you want, 
---
exactly. 
---
Noah look at me, hold my hands, 
---
look in these eyes and tell me you don’t wanna be together anymore. 
---
If that’s what you really want.
---
## NOAH:
I don’t have to do that.
---
## JACKSON:
Shit, you’re freezing.
---
## NOAH:
I’m fine.
---
## JACKSON:
You’re shakin, baby.
---
## NOAH:
I’m, fine.
---
## JACKSON:
You tryin to kick it cold-turkey, honeybee?
---
## NOAH:
I’m doin it. 
---
I get clean and I can be a real part of Benny’s life way I oughtta be. 
---
If I don’t quit she won’t let me see him.
---
## JACKSON:
Can’t not let you see him, he’s yours.
---
## NOAH:
Law says he’s not, gave that up, 
---
you was there when I gave that up.
---
## JACKSON:
You were high as a kite when you gave that up.
---
## NOAH:
That’s the whole point, Jackson.
---
## JACKSON:
What I’m sayin’s maybe it didn’t count when you gave him up 
---
if you weren’t all there to do it.
---
Weren’t sound of mind and all that.
---
Maybe you could take him back if it comes to that.
---
## NOAH:
You really think so?
---
## JACKSON:
I know a kid should be raised by his momma. 
---
Should see her, ‘t least. Very least.
---
## NOAH:
He should see me.
---
## JACKSON:
Should have a dad too. 
---
A better one than his no-show lousy piece of shit dirtbag–
---
## NOAH:
Jackson.
--
## JACKSON:
I could be his dad!
---
## NOAH:
You could maybe. 
---
Maybe you could yeah.
---
## JACKSON:
She won’t let you see him if you don’t break up with me?
---
## NOAH:
If I don’t get clean and you’re a part of that.
---
## JACKSON:
I don’t do it I just sell it!
---
## NOAH:
She kinda thinks that’s worse!
---
## JACKSON:
So I won’t sell it to you no more if that’s what you want! 
---
You, not Harper, screw Harper, 
---
if you want I’ll cut you off here’n now.

## NOAH:
Be nice, 
---
it’s her home we’re in.
---
## JACKSON:
This was both a y’all’s home once, 
---
things had turned out a little different, 
---
this coulda been yours still. 
---
Coulda been you and me round that dinner table. 
---
So screw Harper and her home, I love you. 
---
Clean, high as a damn cloud, I don’t give a shit 
---
but you wanna quit, we can make it happen. 
---
We could have a couple kids of our own, then. 
---
Could buy our own house off Cisco Drive. 
---
You and me and a house full of kids runnin around, 
---
makin a mess.
---
## NOAH:
And a dog?
---
## JACKSON:
Sure a dog!
---
## NOAH:
And you with your own autoshop.
---
## JACKSON:
I’ll wait til Napa goes under and buy the whole damn thing from the bastards.
---
## NOAH:
They deserve it, way they treated you.
---
## JACKSON:
And you could be manager of your own Waffle House.
---
## NOAH:
I don’t– want to manage my own Waffle house, 
---
is that what you think I want with my life?
---
Jesus, Jackson–
---
## JACKSON:
Your own whatever! You can do anything you want, baby!
---
Look a’me. You’re smart.
---
## NOAH:
Didn’t finish high school.
---
## JACKSON:
And you’re still this smart? Lookatchoo!
---
## NOAH:
Jackson…

## JACKSON:
And you’re pretty. 
---
Pretty like a movie star.

## NOAH:

---
## JACKSON:
And you’re good with kids. 
---
You’re great with kids, 
---
my nephews like you better’n they like me.
---
## NOAH:
Your nephews don’t like you very much.
---
## JACKSON:
I know but they love you!
---
## NOAH:
So what’re you saying?
---
## JACKSON:
I’m sayin you’re great at something.
---
## JACKSON:
So we could start our future in some kinda direction.
---
## NOAH:
What about Harper, 
---
what about Benny?
---
## JACKSON:
Benny too.

Picture him’n me outside playin ball.
---
Can’t you see our own little house? 
---
And everyone else stayin out’ve our damn business 
---
and letting us be happy? 
---
Can’t you see us happy?
---
## JACKSON:
Gimme a chance to make us happy, honeybee.

## NOAH:
I was ending it, I was going to, 
---
I was doing it and and he convinced me it wasn’t a good idea.
---
He wants me to get clean too.
---
## JACKSON:
If it’s what she wants, 
---
I aim to help her.
---
## NOAH:
He won’t sell to me no more. 
---
Any more.
---
## JACKSON:
She’s gonna move back in with me.
---
## NOAH:
That we hadn’t talked about, 
---
that I’m not sure about–
---
## JACKSON:
Long-term, at least.
---
## NOAH:
Once I’ve quit for good.
---
## JACKSON:
Main thing is we’re gonna do it together.
---
## NOAH:
He’s gonna help me, Harps.
---
He wants the same thing you do.
---
## HARPER:
I’m gonna give you a count of ten, Jackson, 
---
because I am feeling patient today, 
---
and then I’m going to go out back and unlock the shed, 
---
and I am going to come back in here with my rifle
---
and I am going to shoot you in the foot 
---
because I am licensed to carry in West Virginia 
---
and the law says I can shoot an intruder 
---
and you are an intruder in my home. 

## JACKSON:
I’m not no intruder she let me in!
---
## NOAH:
Harper oh my God it’s not an intruder it’s Jackson.

## JACKSON:
She let me– Noah your sister’s insane.
---
I will not be rude to you,
---
because I was not raised to be rude, 
---
and I will not aim to kill, 
---
but I will shoot you if you stay here 
---
because I do not allow drug dealers in my home, 
---
and certainly not my sister’s drug dealer, is that clear?
---
## HARPER:
Ten.
---
## NOAH:
We all want the same thing, Harps, stoppit.
---
## HARPER:
Nine.
---
## JACKSON:
I ain’t gonna sell to her.
---
## HARPER:
Eight.
---
## NOAH:
We wanna start a life together.
---
## HARPER:
Seven.
---
## NOAH:
I can’t very well start a life off fresh like this, can I?
---
## HARPER:
Six.
---
## NOAH:
Jackson and me are gonna get married.
---
## HARPER:
Five.
---
## JACKSON:
Eventually, not right away.
---
## HARPER:
Four.
---
## NOAH:
When I get clean we’re gonna get married and–
---
## HARPER:
Three.
---
## NOAH:
And Jackson’s gonna get to know Benny and–
---
## HARPER:
Over my dead body, two.
---
## JACKSON:
You’re gonna need me if you want her clean.
---
## JACKSON:
You need someone on your side who knows the drug, 
---
not just her.
---
I could teach you bout it! 
---
I can tell you what her eyes look like when she’s used an hour ago,
---
the way she gets when she needs it, 
---
I know what signs to look out for and when, 
---
I know the places she does it. 
---
That’s some use t’this, ain’t it?
---
Could help you help her better, couldn’t I?
---
## NOAH:
You want me to get better, right?
---
## HARPER:
Yes.
---
## NOAH:
So no gun.
---
## JACKSON:
She was gonna shoot me.
---
## HARPER:
Shut up.
---
## NOAH:
We can make a plan.
---
## HARPER:
Had a plan. 
---
Step number one of the plan was to break up with Jackson.
---
## NOAH:
Us three can make a new plan. 
---
Better this way. 
---
Between the two of y’all you know me all the way, 
---
I couldn’t hide nothing from both of you.
---
## JACKSON:
She has a point.
---
## HARPER:
Shut up.
---
## HARPER:
Noah stays here, that’s not changing.
---
## JACKSON:
If that’s what she wants.
---
## HARPER:
Noah stays here.
---
## NOAH:
Okay.
---
## JACKSON:
Fine.
---
## HARPER:
I don’t want Jackson under the same roof as Benny.
---
## NOAH:
Then where’ll I see him?
---
## HARPER:
He can– come here once a week, 
---
at a time I agree to, 
---
when Benny isn’t home and when I am.
---
## JACKSON:
She ain’t a kid!
---
## HARPER:
This is for now, and I’m being generous.
---
## NOAH:
Yes okay.
---
## JACKSON:
Noah!
---
## NOAH:
Better than breaking up.
---
## HARPER:
If I hear you have drugs on you when you come here.
---
If I hear you offer to sell to Noah ever again.
---
If I hear you do business in my home.
---
## JACKSON:
Whatever, okay.
---
## HARPER:
I will take that rifle and I will shoot you. 
---
And not in the foot. 
---
Do I make myself clear?

## AUBREY:
Is Noah Attridge there?
---
## AUBREY:
Is this the residence of Noah Attridge?
---
## HARPER:
–Is Noah in trouble?
---
## AUBREY:
Oh, no, no no,
---
You’re not in any trouble, 
---
but I am hoping to have a conversation with–
---
## HARPER:
How did you get this address?
---
## AUBREY:
Y’know, I just asked. 
---
People around here– well, you’ve got a small town. 
---
Small town charm!
---
Do people say that, about Williamson?
---
## HARPER:
They do not.
---
## AUBREY:
Well–
---
Listen, I know you’ve been in some trouble as of late 
---
but I’m not here to judge, and I’m not here to–
---
## HARPER:
Some trouble?
---
## AUBREY:
I mean, you must have seen the article, 
---
the, it was trending for a couple days there–
---
## HARPER:
In this small town of ours, 
---
when we knock on a stranger’s door, 
---
we get to the point around why.
---
## AUBREY:
I’m doing a lousy job of this, I’m sorry, 
---
I drove about six hours to get here, to be honest, 
---
so I’m all over the place, and on top of that I’m new-ish to the job, 
---
to the fieldwork side of things, 
---
but I’ll get to my point, I’m sure you’re very busy, 
---
but– I’m Aubrey. 
---
I work for an organization called Project Protection, 
---
and we work with women suffering from addiction. 
---
We look to give them more options. 
---
We know it can feel like there are little to no options.
---
Noah, I’m here to tell you– 
---
to promise you– that you have options.
---
## HARPER:
I’m not Noah.
---
## AUBREY:
Honey, you can–
---
Anything you say to me is confidential, strictly. 
---
You can be real with me.
---
## HARPER:
Oh, I can be real with you?
---
## AUBREY:
One hundred percent.
---
## HARPER:
Oh, good. 
---
Noah’s my sister, that was my sister in the article, not me, 
---
and she’s not here. And I do not use.
---
## AUBREY:
Your sister. 
---
Oh! The article didn’t mention–
---
## HARPER:
What specific business are you here for, Aubrey?
---
## AUBREY:
Like I said, I provide resources for–
---
Listen, this might be more of a private conversation, 
---
would I be able to– come in, if I’m not intruding too much?
---
## HARPER:
Shoes off. House rule.
---
## AUBREY:
Sure, sure. 
---
Thank you, really.
---
She steps in past Harper and takes in the home.
---
## AUBREY:
You’ve got a very nice–
---
## HARPER:
I think I’d like to understand why you drove six hours to 
---
“provide resources” for my sister.
---
## AUBREY:
Honestly, I– usually, 
---
I stick to a two-hour radius max for work, 
---
but that article, the whole story, it touched me. 
---
Really. 
---
I feel drawn to, more than anything, 
---
to helping young women in crisis. 
---
I read the article and I thought– 
---
respectfully– this person needs help. 
---
From someone who gets it, who cares.
---
## HARPER:
Right.
---
Here’s the thing– respectfully– 
---
you don’t know my sister. 
---
You don’t know anything about our lives beyond–
---
## AUBREY:
No, you’re right, no, 
---
but that story made me think about people in my own life who’ve struggled, 
---
who’ve needed help and haven’t asked for it –
---
it made me think about my daughter, actually, and–
---
Like I said, I’m new to the fieldwork. 
---
I don’t know if it’s inappropriate, 
---
telling you all of this,
---
but my daughter is an addict. 
---
So I have a personal connection to all this. 
---
And for the last few
years, I’ve tried to do something about it. 
---
I started volunteering at a shelter for homeless addicts, but it… 
---
it didn’t feel like we were giving those people futures. 
---
We weren’t breaking
the cycle, we were just delaying it a little. 
---
And that was best-case scenario. 
---
I wanted to do more. So this is me trying to more. 
---
Doing it poorly, I guess. 
---
They would’ve sent someone with
more experience, 
---
and someone, well, a bit closer by, 
---
but I told them, I want this case, I feel connected to–
---
## HARPER:
My sister is a case?
---
## AUBREY:
Well, so, only if she chooses to be. 
---
I’m just here to offer help to your sister. 
---
I can’t imagine it’s been easy for anyone involved, 
---
especially with– well, the article mentioned she has a child––
---
## HARPER:
Benny?
---
## AUBREY:
Is that–? Gosh, what a sweet name.
---
## HARPER:
Benny is not in my sister’s custody. 
---
He’s in mine. So he doesn’t need help.
---
## AUBREY:
Oh, I’m sure he’s– 
---
I mean, if he’s in your– that’s great. 
---
So good of you, really. 
---
But I know that children of drug addicts can have their own range of difficulties, 
---
regardless of who’s taking
care of them. 
---
Does he, say– experience any symptoms of NAS?
---
Sorry, that’s neonatal abstinence syndrome–
---
## HARPER:
No, I know what NAS is, 
---
he yeah, he had it.
---
## AUBREY:
And what does that look like now?
---
I know most kids with NAS can barely go fifteen seconds without losing focus, so.
---
## HARPER:
...He has ADHD.
---
## AUBREY:
Trouble sleeping? 
---
Hard times with goodbyes, even temporary ones? 
---
Seizures, occasionally?
---
## HARPER:
Uh. All of those, yes.
---
## AUBREY:
It’s brutal, right? How old was your sister when he was born? 
---
If you don’t mind me asking.
---
## HARPER:
Honestly, I still don’t entirely understand what you’re here for.
---
## AUBREY:
You don’t trust me, I get it, 
---
I’m a stranger from out of town and I just showed up out of the blue and–
---
I’m sorry, what’s your name?
---
## HARPER:
–Harper.
---
## AUBREY:
Harper. 
---
Harper, listen, 
---
I’m already bending some confidentiality requirements 
---
to talk to you with your sister not present, 
---
which is–my fault, not yours– 
---
so I’m gonna save the nitty-gritty of all this 
---
for when I get the chance to talk to Noah, 
---
but the short story is that I work to help women 
---
in circumstances outside of their control regain that control. 
---
We would work together,
---
based on your sister’s needs. 
---
I’m just someone looking to help.
---
And in the meantime, 
---
the least I can do is listen. 
---
I know there have been times in my life 
---
when I really could’ve used someone, 
---
someone who understood, 
---
to just listen.
---
## AUBREY:
I can. Put on my shoes and go, if.
---
## HARPER:
She was fifteen. 
---
Almost sixteen. When Benny was born.
---
## AUBREY:
Oh, young, gosh. 
---
And you’ve been taking care of them both ever since?
---
## HARPER:
I’ve… 
---
I’ve had custody since Benny was six months old, 
---
I mean officially, but Noah was never–
---
I mean she was still a kid, when he–
---
## AUBREY:
Of course.
---
## HARPER:
She had high school, she had–
---
## AUBREY:
Fifteen.
---
## HARPER:
Right. 
---
But she moved out at seventeen, so. 
---
She’s taken care of herself since then.
---
## AUBREY:
Independent! Wow.
---
## HARPER:
Well, it wasn’t– entirely her decision, 
---
she’d relapsed, after this long period of– 
---
her longest, I guess, of sobriety, and I couldn’t have her around–
---
## AUBREY:
Benny, right, of course.
---
## HARPER:
So she’s lived with her boyfriend, mostly, since. 
---
Till now.
---
## AUBREY:
That period of sobriety, how long was–?
---
## HARPER:
Nine months, almost ten. 
---
Our mom had just OD’d, so– wake-up call, all that.
---
## AUBREY:
Your mother was a user.
---
## HARPER:
Of OxyContin, not– 
---
but yeah.
---
## AUBREY:
These generational cycles. Hard to break.
---
## HARPER:
I don’t know about cycles. 
---
She got in a car crash, 
---
never stopped taking what they gave her afterward. 
---
Noah, she’d take pills with her friends 
---
like some kids take whiskey from their parents’ liquor cabinets, 
---
it wasn’t like they were the same.
---
## AUBREY:
You’ve had to take care of a lot of people.
---
Aubrey’s gaze lands on a nearby framed picture of Benny.
---
## AUBREY:
Is this–?
---
## HARPER:
That’s him.
---
## AUBREY:
Oh he is precious.
---
Oh look at those cheeks. That smile.
---
## HARPER:
He’s got my sister’s smile.
---
## AUBREY:
You two have the same eyes, though. 
---
Wow, it’s striking.
---
## HARPER:
I don’t know.
---
## AUBREY:
He’s lucky to have you. 
---
You seem like a great mom.
---
## HARPER:
Well, guardian.
---
## AUBREY:
Guardian, right, sorry. 
---
Just– do you plan to transfer care back to your sister at any point?
---
## HARPER:
I, no.
---
## AUBREY:
And you said you’ve raised him all by yourself?
---
## HARPER:
I have.
---
## AUBREY:
Huh. Sounds like a mom to me.
---
## HARPER:
Just to be clear– Benny’s not a burden. 
---
To me or to Noah. 
---
And Noah, actually, she’s decided
---
she wants to get clean.
---
## AUBREY:
Oh! That must be a recent development.
---
## HARPER:
Yeah, it’s only been a few days, but–
---
## AUBREY:
Right, since the– sorry, you said she’s out of the house?
---
## HARPER:
Well, right now, she’s at work.
---
## AUBREY:
Stop me if I’m overstepping, but, 
---
I assume you’re checking her location every ten, fifteen
minutes?
---
## HARPER:
I’m not, she doesn’t have a smartphone.
---
## AUBREY:
A tracker, then?
---
## HARPER:
I wouldn’t even know where to get one of those, 
---
not in Williamson.
---
## AUBREY:
Do you have her boss’s number?
---
## HARPER:
I– no.
---
## AUBREY:
Huh. Have you been checking her arms every night, 
---
her legs, her feet, her belly, even? 
---
Her pupils?
---
## HARPER:
No, okay, no, but this isn’t the first time we’ve done this. 
---
The last time she promised to get clean, she did. 
---
For nine months, like I said.
---
## AUBREY:
But at some point she’d been clean for nine months 
---
and she still slipped up, right? 
---
And then it was zero days. 
---
And now it’s been a few days. 
---
It’s a hill you don’t stop climbing, unfortunately.
---
I’m not here to scare you 
---
and say your sister’ definitely out there getting high right now, 
---
or planning to. 
---
I’m just saying you’d have no way of knowing if she was.
---
## HARPER:
Look, you don’t know my sister.
---
## AUBREY:
Of course. 
---
But addiction is more formulaic than you’d think. 
---
Addicts’ behavior may seem
random, 
---
but in some ways, it’s not at all.
---
She probably said that this time would be different, right? 
---
Accused you of not trusting her, believing in her? 
---
Made you feel like if you gave up on her, 
---
there’d be no point in her trying to get clean at all.
---
I’ve heard all the lines. 
---
Heard them, believed them, heard them again.
---
Maybe I’m wrong, but.
---
## HARPER:
I should get her boss’s number.
---
## AUBREY:
Just a suggestion. 
---
I have more, if you’re open to hearing them.

Well, you’re not gonna be helping out by getting sick everywhere, so–

## NOAH:
It’ll pass. Only threw up once today.

## HARPER:
You sure you can work, feeling like this?
---
## NOAH:
Work helps. Keeps me too busy to think about it.
---
## HARPER:
About the nausea?
---
## NOAH:
About drugs.
---
## HARPER:
I was gonna offer you an aspirin for your stomach 
---
but maybe that’s not a good idea.

## NOAH:
It’s heroin I want, Harper, 
---
I don’t think aspirin’s gonna be an issue.

Y’know I’ve never done a single drug in my life?
---
## NOAH:
Well, good, I’ve got you beat at one thing.
---
## HARPER:
Psh. You’ve beat me at plenty.
---
## NOAH:
Like what?
---
## HARPER:
You always had more friends!
---
## NOAH:
That don’t count.
---
## HARPER:
It counts, it counts.
---
Mom liked you better.
---
## NOAH:
That ain’t true.
---
## HARPER:
Don’t play dumb, you were her baby.
---
## NOAH:
I don’t know.
---
## HARPER:
You do so know.
---
## NOAH:
Maybe a little bit.
---
But I always thought she liked your daddy better.
---
## HARPER:
She hated yours and mine, the both of em.
---
## NOAH:
Hated yours less though!
---
## HARPER:
…Maybe a little bit.
---
## NOAH:
Uh huh.
---
I felt bad for her. I think that’s why I could never get mad. 
---
I just felt so bad for her.
---
## HARPER:
I didn’t. Made every decision got her where she was.
---
## NOAH:
Here we go with the…
---
## HARPER:
What?
---
## NOAH:
You can just. Be a lil judgy is all.
---
## HARPER:
Excuse me!
---
## NOAH:
That can’t be news t’you.
---
## HARPER:
If I was judgy I would’ve–
---
## NOAH:
What?
---
## HARPER:
Well! Said a lot to you that I haven’t!
---
## NOAH:
Ohoho, hold up.
---
## HARPER:
No, we’re not doin this,
---
## NOAH:
What’ve you held back from sayin to me?
---
## HARPER:
I’m just saying.

That if I were looking for things to judge

I’d have no shortage of those things but I’m not looking!

## NOAH:
Buuuullllshiiiiit.

## HARPER:
Noah–!
---
## NOAH:
Bullcrap, sorry!
---
## NOAH:
I think you don’t know how to dress as good as you could.
---
## HARPER:
What?
---
## NOAH:
That’s something I judge about you. 
---
I’ve held back from saying it.
---
## HARPER:
I don’t like this. I don’t wanna fight.
---
## NOAH:
It’s not fighting! It’s a game!
---
## HARPER:
I don’t like games.
---
## NOAH:
Oh I know! 
---
You know I took out Candy Land t’play with Benny 
---
and he said he’d never played
before?
---
## HARPER:
We’re missing some pieces. 
---
Pieces you lost, if I remember–
---
## NOAH:
What do you play, then? 
---
Kid’s gotta have fun sometime!
---
## HARPER:
You can make jokes about my clothes 
---
but not about how I raise Benny.
---
## NOAH:
You’re so serious.
---
## HARPER:
There’s a puzzle I think, in the back of the closet. 
---
You can do that with him.
---
## NOAH:
That what y’all do?
---
## HARPER:
No, he hasn’t seen it yet,
---
## NOAH:
It’s new?
---
## HARPER:
Yeah, it’s not a big deal. 
---
Like you said, I don’t like games anyway.
---
## NOAH:
Look at you bein all nice.
---
## HARPER:
Quit.
---
## NOAH:
My biiig sister, takin care of me.
---
## HARPER:
Okay, okay.
---
## NOAH:
I should go lie down before my stomach gets all… yeah.
---
## HARPER:
You have bad taste in men.
---
## NOAH:
What?
---
## HARPER:
I was– the game, I was trying to play–
---
## NOAH:
You got no taste in men and no friends 
---
cause you’re always here or at work.
---
## HARPER:
You… act less smart than you really are 
---
so people don’t take you as seriously as they could.
---
## NOAH:
You’re bossy.
---
## HARPER:
I am not! Am I?
---
## NOAH:
Oh my Lord, Harps, yes.
---
## HARPER:
You curse too much.
---
## NOAH:
You can’t take a joke. 
---
You’ve never been able to take a joke.
---
## HARPER:
Alright, we’re done.
---
## NOAH:
(What’d I say.)
---
## HARPER:
By the way, I have friends.
---
## NOAH:
Okay, I just don’t know them!
---
## HARPER:
I work with them! 
---
It’s tame, maybe, but it’s good, 
---
we joke about our least favorite students in the teacher’s lounge 
---
and Lori Holden brings homemade apple cake 
---
and it’s y’know it’s pretty
bad 
---
but we all eat it anyway. 
---
I don’t need to go out and make a fool of myself to have fun. 
---
Not that– I’m not saying that’s what you do.
---
Okay now that I’m listening for it maybe I’m. 
---
A little judgy.
---
## NOAH:
You could stand to go out was all I meant.
---
## HARPER:
Go out? What town do you live in?
---
## NOAH:
There’s Dandy’s!
---
## HARPER:
Dandy’s. Gross.

## NOAH:
I just don’t want you to be lonely!

## HARPER:
I don’t have enough free time on my hands to get lonely.

## NOAH:
Yeah.
---
I get pretty lonely.
---
## HARPER:
You do?
---
## NOAH:
Yeah.
---
## HARPER:
I’m sorry.
---
## NOAH:
Naw. Just.
---
You know. I got too many dead friends.
---
## HARPER:
I know.
---
## NOAH:
Less lonely stayin here though. 
---
If you’d let me spend more time with Benny and you I’d barely be–
---
## HARPER:
We’ll work up to it.
---
## NOAH:
Right.
---
## HARPER:
Maybe a change could help.
---
## NOAH:
Change’a what?
---
## HARPER:
Something. Job, maybe.
---
## NOAH:
Cause Williamson’s got so many of those.
---
## HARPER:
Place, then.
---
## NOAH:
You tryna get rid of me?
---
## HARPER:
No, I just want you to think about your future.
---
## NOAH:
Actually. 
---
Jackson and me, we always talked about. 
---
If I ever stayed clean and all that, 
---
we always wanted to start a family. 
---
We got a list of baby names on his phone and everything.
---
So that could be a change.
---
## HARPER:
Like kids, having kids?
---
## NOAH:
Yup. Brothers and sisters for Benny, so.
---
## HARPER:
–Oh.
---
## NOAH:
What does oh mean.
---
## HARPER:
It’s just quick, 
---
it’s just kinda soon I guess to hear you say–
---
## NOAH:
You’re the one said I needed a change, needed to think about my future.
---
## HARPER:
I meant I could help you look for a new job, 
---
or take a class at Southern Tech, not–!
---
## NOAH:
We don’t want the same stuff, Harp!
---
## HARPER:
Obviously not, but–
---
## NOAH:
Just cause you think what I want is dumb doesn’t mean it’s dumb to me.
---
## NOAH:
Remember when Benny was born?
---
## HARPER:
Of course I do.
---
## NOAH:
It all happened so fast. 
---
Those first few months, the agreements we made. 
---
Always thought I’d get him back, y’know, at some point. 
---
When I was old enough, or.
---
---
## HARPER:
Fast or not, you agreed it was the best thing, 
---
you signed the custody papers.
---
## NOAH:
Well, I wasn’t right of mind when I signed them.
---
## HARPER:
And doesn’t that just go to show why you didn’t get him back?
---
## NOAH:
I’m right of mind now!
---
## HARPER:
For now you are, yes.
---
template: overlap
## NOAH:
You think I won’t–

## HARPER:
I don’t think anything.
---
template: overlap
## NOAH:
For now you said, you don’t think I’ll be able to–

## HARPER:
I think it’s been four days, Noah!
---
## NOAH:
Fine.
---
## HARPER:
It’s just–
---
## NOAH:
I SAID FINE LET’S DROP IT.
---
template: noise

---
## NOAH:
I didn’t mean to.
---
## NOAH:
I can help, I can–
---
## HARPER:
You stay put, I’ll tend to him.
---
## NOAH:
I’m sorry, I didn’t–
---
## HARPER:
Noah.
---
## NOAH:
I’m fine, go.
---
Please go.

## AUBREY:
I was so glad you called. 
---
Any excuse to get out of that motel, really, 
---
is a [ha] welcome one.
---
I think I’m the only guest, as a matter of fact.
---
## NOAH:
That motel’s haunted as shit.
---
## HARPER:
Cursing jar, Noah.
---
## NOAH:
I’m Noah.
---
## AUBREY:
Hi! Aubrey! It’s nice to–
---
## NOAH:
Oh you’re not from here.
---
## AUBREY:
People keep saying that.
---
## NOAH:
Who is she?
---
## HARPER:
She’s someone who’s here to help.
---
## AUBREY:
Can I sit at the table with you?
---
## NOAH:
Ain’t my house.
---
## HARPER:
Of course you can, I’ll, uh.
---
You want something to eat, drink? We’ve got water or tea.
---
## AUBREY:
Herbal?
---
## HARPER:
–Sweet.
---
## AUBREY:
I’m good, thanks, we can just, sit and chat.
---
## NOAH:
What’d’you mean she’s here to help?
---
## HARPER:
Let’s be polite, Noah.
---
## NOAH:
I’m just askin.
---
## AUBREY:
And it’s a reasonable question! 
---
I came by the other day to, 
---
well, I was looking for you, but I found Harper, 
---
and we talked and talked and– I hope it was useful–
---
## HARPER:
It was, very.
---
## AUBREY:
–and I asked her if I could meet with you 
---
and she said she’d think about it and–
---
## NOAH:
Lucky me.
---
## HARPER:
She works with addicts.
---
## AUBREY:
Female addicts.
---
## NOAH:
Cat’s out of the bag, huh.
---
## AUBREY:
Oh, she didn’t, uh. 
---
I read an article, a couple, actually, about the uh–
---
## NOAH:
Great.
---
## AUBREY:
But I could’ve– and please don’t take this in a bad way–
---
## NOAH:
I’m listenin.
---
## AUBREY:
I could’ve recognized you as an addict without the article.
---
## NOAH:
Gee, Harps, you got some sweet friends.
---
## AUBREY:
It must sound– sorry– I’m just,
---
between personal experience and my field of work, 
---
I know how to recognize–
---
## NOAH:
What exactly is that field?
---
## AUBREY:
I’m a representative for Project Protection.
---
## NOAH:
I never heard of y’all.
---
## AUBREY:
We work with female addicts 
who have had 
---
or are considering having more children.
---
## HARPER:
She wants to help provide resources for us.
---
## NOAH:
Like money?
---
## AUBREY:
There is a cash incentive aspect to what we do, yes.
---
## NOAH:
Cash, nice.
---
## HARPER:
Do we need to apply for some kind of loan or–
---
## AUBREY:
No no, no application necessary,
---
## NOAH:
Free cash!
---
## HARPER:
I thought you were offering subsidized Narcan 
---
or– I don’t know, rehab services–
---
## AUBREY:
Right, no, we’re– 
---
that stuff is all great, believe me, but– 
---
we stay a little more focused in our mission.
---
## NOAH:
What’s your “mission?”
---
## AUBREY:
[deep breath]
---
## AUBREY:
As of this month, 
---
we’ve successfully provided 
7,695 addicts with permanent birth control, 
---
and through the considerable generosity of donors worldwide,
---
we are equipped with the resources to compensate them 
---
for the operation in question.
---
## HARPER:
Permanent birth control? 
---
Are you saying you– what, sterilize people?
---
## NOAH:
You can go to hell, and you can go with her.
---
## HARPER:
Wait, I didn’t– this is news to me, Noah.
---
## NOAH:
Like hell it is, 

I tell you me and Jackson wanna start a family when I’ve been clean for a while
---
and you call up your friend and say hey come on over 
---
and fix her like a goddamn dog.
---
## AUBREY:
Harper and I did not discuss the specifics of my organization.
---
## HARPER:
I called her because I realized I might– 

need someone else, someone with experience to help me help you better– 
---
I didn’t know.
---
## AUBREY:
Listen, I know how it sounds at first. 
---
Believe me, I do.
---
## HARPER:
It sounds like you pay addicts to get sterilized.
---
## AUBREY:
See, I don’t– personally, 
---
I don’t like to use that word.
---
## NOAH:
How is that even legal?
---
## HARPER:
It’s bribery.
---
## AUBREY:
It– no, actually– the cash incentive just makes it more attractive, 
---
but it’s all voluntary.
---
## NOAH:
How do y’all know I wouldn’t go and use your cash incentive to re-up?
---
## AUBREY:
We don’t. 
---
All parts of the process rely on the free will of our clients. 
---
It would be coercive, otherwise.
---
## HARPER:
It’s coercive as is. 
---
They’re addicts, they’re not thinking straight.
---
## NOAH:
I can talk for myself. I’m getting clean, 
---
you tell her that?
---
## AUBREY:
She did, and I think it’s great you’re trying.
---
And–I know this all sounds a little intense. 

When you first hear it. 

But the reality is that we
live in a country that isn’t yet equipped 
---
to properly care for those suffering from addiction, 
---
let alone to help those in the path of, ah. 
---
Destruction’s not exactly the right word–
---
## HARPER:
This is not sounding any less intense.
---
## AUBREY:
And, and, most people don’t know this, 
---
addiction is 50% attributed to genetic predisposition,okay? 
---
The children of addicts are eight times more likely to develop an addiction of their own so, 
---
so it’s one part of the problem we can address.
---
## HARPER:
One part of the–
---
## AUBREY:
It’s not the only solution, 
---
it’s not a perfect solution, maybe, 
---
but it’s a solution. To kids being raised with disadvantages 
---
they had no part in causing. 
---
Harper, you yourself said Benny has challenges.
---
## HARPER:
I’m gonna ask you to keep Benny out of this.
---
Sorry to waste your time, but we’re not interested.
---
## AUBREY:
Harper mentioned on the phone that you’re dating your drug dealer.
---
## HARPER:
I–
---
## NOAH:
Harper!
---
## AUBREY:
I want you to think about how exactly you’re going to get clean and start a family with him,
---
while he still has the product. 
---
While he’s still in the world you’re trying to get out of, right?
---
## NOAH:
You don’t know.
---
## AUBREY:
With due respect, my–
---
My daughter is a heroin addict. I do know.
---
## NOAH:
She get the operation then?
---
## AUBREY:
She did not.
---
## NOAH:
So she could be out there with more kids’n me, then.
---
## AUBREY:
My daughter is dead.
---
But, no, she did not get it before.
---
But she was also– clean, for five years, before she. 
---
It’s reserved for active users, so.
---
## NOAH:
Seems kinda fucked 
---
to only offer it to someone who you know’s not thinking straight.
---
## AUBREY:
And to me I guess it seems shortsighted and selfish 
---
to expose a fetus to opioids and raise that child in an unsafe environment.
------
## NOAH:
Benny’s safe.

## AUBREY:
And you haven’t raised him.
---
With all due respect.
---
---
## AUBREY:
This has all the information, the statistics of our business.
---
Six thousand of our clients’ living children 
---
are out of their custody, in foster care. 
---
That’s two times the population of this whole town.
---
Then, there’s eight hundred stillborns. 
---
Five hundred babies dying shortly after birth.
---
In an ideal world, we’d be able to do more for everyone involved. 
---
It’s just that right now no
one’s being helped, so.
---
She waits for a reaction and gets none.
---
## AUBREY:
The pamphlet also describes the financial compensation you’d receive. 
---
The um, the money.
---
## NOAH:
I know. What compensation means.
---
## AUBREY:
Just think about it.
---
## NOAH:
Go to hell.
---
## HARPER:
You’ll be done at nine?
---
## NOAH:
Yep.
---
I’m not just tryin. 
---
I’m doin it. 
---
Been doin it five days. 
---
You don’t know.
---
## AUBREY:
–I wish you the best of luck.
---
template: noise

---
## HARPER:
You need to leave too.
---
## AUBREY:
Harper, I want to help.
---
## HARPER:
I’m actually good, thanks.
---
## AUBREY:
You’re just going to keep being put in the same position, otherwise. 
---
Raising her kids, kids with
challenges.
---
## HARPER:
I told you Benny is not a burden.
---
## AUBREY:
And I heard you, I hear you. 
---
But what about six Bennys? 

And what about when she relapses and you’re having to take care of her, too?
---
Your sister’s choices shouldn’t always have to be your responsibility. 
---
That’s all I’m saying.
---
---
## AUBREY:
It seems like you’d do pretty much anything for your family. 
---
I get it, I’m the same way. 
---
But don’t think you’re doing her a favor by expecting her to change overnight.
---
My Charlotte relapsed after five years. Five– years, and I still wonder what I could’ve–
---
It never ends, so.
---
---
## AUBREY:
For when you change your mind, okay?
---
---
## HARPER:
You’re home late.
---
## NOAH:
Walked home.
---
## HARPER:
I could’ve given you a ride.
---
## NOAH:
No need.
---
## HARPER:
Well, I had to stay up and wait.
---
## NOAH:
Didn’t have to.
---
## HARPER:
I need to know you’re home and safe.
---
## NOAH:
I walk home from work plenty. 
---
Ain’t been murdered yet.
---
## HARPER:
You seemed upset when you left, I was worried–
---
## NOAH:
Worried I’d what?
---
## HARPER:
Noah.
---
## NOAH:
You treat me like I’m a bomb about to go off. Y
---
ou think that helps? It don’t help.
---
## HARPER:
Just– give me a call next time you’re walking home.
---
## NOAH:
Great. 
---
Gimme a call next time you wanna get my tubes tied for cash.
---
## HARPER:
I told you, I didn’t know what Aubrey–
---
## NOAH:
Stupid name.
---
## HARPER:
I didn’t know.
---
## NOAH:
You told her about Jackson.
---
## HARPER:
I…
---
You’re right. I’m sorry.
---
---
## HARPER:
I have– a hard time being helped.
---
She seemed like she had help to give. 
---
It’s not like there’s a handbook to all this, 
---
I don’t know what I’m doing any more than…
---
I feel pretty stupid now, so.
---
## NOAH:
You’re not stupid.
---
Nosy know-it-all, maybe, but not stupid.
---
## HARPER:
Thanks.
---
## NOAH:
Pushy control freak, maybe, but–
---
## HARPER:
Alright, alright.
---
## NOAH:
There was this one day when–
---
you remember that heat wave, when I was.. five or six? 
---
You woulda been ten.
---
## HARPER:
I remember.
---
## NOAH:
Well, you were at school, I wasn’t old enough yet, 
---
and Mom was somewhere, work I guess,
---
And it was just about June, 
---
and it was already so hot I thought I’d die. 
---
I’d been sucking on ice
cubes and keeping the fridge open with my face in it, 
---
but I knew Mom would get mad at me for wasting.
---
And I went out and checked the mail, don’t know why, 
---
just felt hopeful,
---
And there was this flyer from this air conditioning company. 
---
BUY TODAY, in huge letters. 
---
It was all blue, with snowflakes or icicles or somethin going across it, 
---
and it had the phone number underneath. 
---
And a picture of a girl with the air going in her face, looking so happy.
---
And I was feelin– brave, or spiteful, or something, 
---
that all the fans we had weren’t doing crap
---
but taking hot air and blowing it right back at us, 
---
and you got to be at school in a nice cool classroom 
---
and here I was stuck in my own sweat, 
---
and I took the home phone and called the number, made my voice a lil deeper, 
---
and I ordered an air conditioner.
---
It was a hundred fifty dollars. 
---
One forty-nine ninety-nine.
---
Mom had her credit card in her nightstand, 
---
and I went and took it and read the numbers.
---
And I knew I’d done something bad, 
---
even while I was doin it.
---
But I thought maybe– maybe– Mom would understand. 
---
Or be happy I’d done it. She didn’t like the heat either.
---
And it took three weeks and I don’t think I slept once in those three weeks, 
---
and then it showed up on our doorstep 
---
and Mom looked at it and said, there musta been some kind of mistake.
---
And then she looked at me and I must have looked guilty as sin, 
---
cause she looked at me for a
long time without saying a word 
---
and then she went and called the credit card company. 
---
And I thought she was gonna whoop me so bad. 
---
But she just told them, all calm, 
---
there must have been some kind of mistake, 
---
and she’d be returning it.
---
She sorted it all out on the phone. 
---
Didn’t even open the box. 
---
Brought it to the post office the next day and it was gone. 
---
And when she got home, she went to her room 
---
and took the fan in there and brought it into our room. 
---
Do you remember, when all of a sudden we had two fans?
---
## HARPER:
I do.
---
## NOAH:
And I was cryin, following her, 
---
and sayin how sorry I was, and she didn’t have to do that, 
---
she needed that fan more’n we did, 
---
and she didn’t even look at me, she just plugged it in, 
---
went back to her room, shut the door.
---
And the second fan helped a little, on the hottest days. 
---
But I felt sick to my stomach every time it did.
---
## HARPER:
You never told me all that.
---
## NOAH:
Never came up.
---
## HARPER:
She shouldn’t have left you alone in the heat.
---
She could’ve brought you to work, 
---
or dropped you at the church for daycare.
---
## NOAH:
She did the best she could.
---
Anyway, it’s just a memory. Came to me all of a sudden.
---
---
## HARPER:
I’m gonna need some help with Benny.
---
## NOAH:
I can play with him. Or, take him to school–
---
## HARPER:
No, I mean– he has some challenges. 
---
Behavioral, learning, uh. 
---
He needs therapy, 
---
he might even need to go to an out-of-district school next year, 
---
is what his Pre-K teacher thinks.
---
## NOAH:
Thought he was gonna be in your class next year.
---
## HARPER:
I did too. I’m not so sure. 
---
He’s a bright kid, just. 
---
He needs more support than he’s getting, right now.
---
## NOAH:
What are you askin me right now.
---
## HARPER:
I’m not–
---
## NOAH:
Be honest.
---
## HARPER:
–Noah, I can’t afford another kid.
---
## NOAH:
I never said you were getting one.
---
Did Aubrey tell you you were getting another–
---
## HARPER:
She just raised some questions. 
---
Questions I should’ve considered without her having to ask them.
---
## NOAH:
You want me to do it.
---
## HARPER:
That’s not what I’m saying.
---
## NOAH:
You didn’t say no.
---
---
## NOAH:
I, uh. Got Employee of the Week. 
---
They put my picture up today.
---
template: overlap
## HARPER:
Oh. Noah, that’s–

## NOAH:
It’s Waffle House, it’s stupid, it doesn’t matter.
---
## HARPER:
Of course it matters.
---
## NOAH:
It’s been everyone but me for years 
---
so I guess they had to get around to me at some point.
---
## HARPER:
I’m proud of you.
---
## NOAH:
There’s no prize or anything.
---
## HARPER:
Still. Congratulations.
---
## NOAH:
I’ll read the pamphlet once 
---
and then we’re never talking about it again.
---
## HARPER:
Okay.
---
## NOAH:
Having kids could make me have to be better.
---
I’m doing good with Benny. 
---
I did that puzzle with him this mornin and he liked it. 
---
He really liked it. 
---
Said there’s not always a lot of playin happens around here, so.
---
## HARPER:
It’s late, get some sleep. 
---
You need a ride to work tomorrow?
---
---
## HARPER:
Right, then. So,
---
## JACKSON:
Tea’s real good, Harps.
---
## HARPER:
Don’t call me Harps.
---
## JACKSON:
Noah calls you Harps!
---
## HARPER:
You’re not family.
---
## JACKSON:
Not yet, anyway!
---
## HARPER:
So the reason I asked you here.
---
## JACKSON:
You’re tired of her sleepin here? 
---
She snores like a woman twice her age, 
---
I’ll give y’that much, I’ll take her back in with–
---
## HARPER:
No, Noah stays put.
---
## JACKSON:
She hasn’t used since last week. 
---
Or asked to cop any, I’d have told you.
---
## HARPER:
Good, I mean that’s all good, but–
---
Jackson, you care about my sister?
---
## JACKSON:
Course I do. Like a fool I do.
---
## HARPER:
Enough to stop selling? 
---
Not just to her, I mean at all.
---
## JACKSON:
Uh… I got laid off months ago from Napa. 
---
I gotta eat. 
---
‘N so does my brother Jason, can’t work on account of his Iraq leg.
---
## HARPER:
You were selling before your job there.
---
## JACKSON:
It’s the best money I can make in Mingo County, 
---
let alone Williamson. 
---
I don’t know what t’tell you, you know about jobs here. 
---
The Economy, all that. 
---
Ain’t what it was.
---
Way I see it, they’ll get it somewhere else if they don’t get it from me, 
---
and from me they get it cleaner, 
---
and I don’t sell in bulk, 
---
and it ain’t from a junkie. 
---
I tell the folks I sell to what they can handle and can’t.
---
## HARPER:
Could Noah get it from somewhere else? 
---
Does she know anyone?
---
## JACKSON:
She don’t know the others, ain’t many close by. 
---
Might’ve heard some names but she don’t know how to get to’m.
---
## HARPER:
What about the rest of Mingo County?
---
## JACKSON:
She’s here or at work! 
---
Ain’t driving through the whole county lookin.
---
## HARPER:
You don’t know that.
---
## JACKSON:
I do know that.
---
## HARPER:
Cause you trust her?
---
## JACKSON:
No, cause I know her! 
---
And I love her, and she loves me just’s much. 
---
She wouldn’t buy from no one else but me.
---
## HARPER:
You say it like it’s sweet.
---
## JACKSON:
I just know her is all. 
---
Know what she’d do and wouldn’t. 
---
Don’t you?
---
## NOAH:
Baby, what’re you–?
---
## JACKSON:
–Surprise!
---
## JACKSON:
Harper thought we could all eat dinner together. 
---
Like a family!
---
## HARPER:
Oh, I didn’t say that.
---
## NOAH:
Harper, you did this for me? 
---
You really did this for me?
---
## JACKSON:
Your hair smells like bacon.
---
## NOAH:
Oh shit, shoot, does it?
---
## JACKSON:
I like it.
---
## NOAH:
Jackson loves food, all food. Loves it. 
---
Once we had a fight and he came to work 
---
and ordered so much stuff so he could keep talking to me til we made up.
---
## JACKSON:
I ordered so much stuff.
---
## NOAH:
He got like six different combos 
---
I don’t even know how he did it.
---
## JACKSON:
Couldn’t even look at waffles for a week.
---
## HARPER:
Okay let’s eat dinner. Jackson can stay another half hour.
---
## NOAH:
Wait could Benny meet–?!
---
## HARPER:
He’s in his room and staying there, 
---
I gave him dinner before. Workin on your puzzle.
---
## NOAH:
He likes puzzles now.
---
But next time maybe?
---
## HARPER:
We’ll work up to maybe.
---
## NOAH:
This is good. This makes me happy!
---
## HARPER:
Go on and change, Jackson’ll help me with the food.
---
## NOAH:
Be nice, everyone?
---
## HARPER:
I need something from you.
---
## JACKSON:
Okay,
---
## HARPER:
I need all the names. 
---
All the people, all the addresses I could go to 
---
if she doesn’t come home on time one day.
---
## JACKSON:
You want a list of every drop-off spot in Mingo County?
---
## HARPER:
That’s exactly what I want, 
---
and you’re gonna make it before Noah comes back in, 
---
so start.
---
---
## JACKSON:
You treat your kids this way, all bossy like that?
---
## HARPER:
I treat children like children, 
---
if that’s what you’re asking.
---
## JACKSON:
This why you don’t have a boyfriend, huh.
---
## HARPER:
You wanna say that a little louder?
---
## JACKSON:
I could fix you up with my cousin Jim on my mom’s side. 
---
Ain’t all that much to look at but he’s sure nice. 
---
Me’n Noah could take Benny off your hands 
---
and you could live your own life for–
---
## HARPER:
Me raising Benny is not some kind of temporary situation, 
---
and you are never going to be a
part of his life.
---
## JACKSON:
He’s Noah’s kid, ain’t he? 
---
I could be his step-daddy.
---
## HARPER:
You shut your goddamn mouth.
---
---
## JACKSON:
You know somethin, Harper? 
---
You put me down time and time again, 
---
in front of Noah, to my face and everything, 
---
and I don’t say a word. 
---
I don’t say nothin unkind back to you, nothin disrespectful. 
---
But you try a man’s last nerve, alright? 
---
I’m, listen. I’m not some idiot 
---
and I’m not uncaring and I’m not a bad person. 
---
I’m good. I try to be good. 
---
And I am always good to your
sister, as good as I know how. 
---
She could do worse, okay? 
---
I ain’t perfect but she could– I try to be good. 
---
So just, so just, dangit,
---
Can’t we be civil, ‘tleast? 
---
For Noah’s sake?
---
## NOAH:
You helpin out my sister, Jackson?
---
## JACKSON:
Tryin to.
---
## HARPER:
You can set the table.
---
## JACKSON:
I’m on it.
---
## HARPER:
But wash your hands first, 
---
I don’t need help from hands looking like those.
---
## HARPER:
Dinner’s just about ready.
---
## NOAH:
Are you puttin him to bed?
---
## HARPER:
Yeah, it’s lights out.
---
## NOAH:
I can do it.
---
## HARPER:
I got it.
---
---
## HARPER:
What took you so–
---
## JACKSON:
Came fast as I could.
---
## HARPER:
Where were you?
---
## JACKSON:
Job interview. Food City. 
---
I left soon as I saw you’d called.
---
## HARPER:
Has she called, texted?
---
## JACKSON:
Nothing, I wasn’t even gonna see her today.
---
## HARPER:
Shhhhhoot. Shoot.
---
Did you say job interview?
---
## JACKSON:
Food City, yeah. Good not great.
--
Don’t worry, we’ll find her.
---
## HARPER:
Do you think she’s used?
---
## JACKSON:
Like I said I haven’t–
---
## HARPER:
If you had to guess.
---
## JACKSON:
I’d guess yeah. If I had to.
---
## HARPER:
But nothing happened, nothing went wrong, 
---
she seemed like she was doing so much better–
---
## JACKSON:
Nothing has to happen.
---
## HARPER:
She didn’t take my car, she can’t be too far away.
---
## JACKSON:
Coulda hitched.
---
## HARPER:
Do you have any idea of who could’ve sold it to her?
---
## JACKSON:
Called every man on that list, on th’way here. 
---
Half picked up, said they didn’t sell shit.
---
## HARPER:
They’re drug dealers, they lie.
---
## JACKSON:
Hey.
---
## HARPER:
It’s my fault she got the list, 
---
it was in the pocket of the–
---
If she’s high right now it’s my fault, 
---
or if she’s– not safe–
---
## JACKSON:
No one’s fault, don’t work that way. 
---
’Cept the ones getting rich off poor folks dying. 
---
Big Pharma, they can burn in Hell.
---
## HARPER:
Jackson, you profit off it.
---
## JACKSON:
I ain’t rich! I try to keep them from dying, 
---
I don’t get no one new on the habit.
---

A knock on the door
---
## JACKSON:
Noah?!
---
## HARPER:
Why would Noah knock?
---
## AUBREY:
Harper. I got your, all your voicemails. 
---
You did the right thing, calling–
---
## HARPER:
I don’t know what I’m doing.
---
## AUBREY:
Breathe, hon. How can I help?
---
## HARPER:
Jackson has the addresses. This is Jackson.
---
## JACKSON:
Who’s she?
---
## AUBREY:
This is her dealer?
---
## JACKSON:
Whoa.
---
## HARPER:
And boyfriend.
---
## JACKSON:
Just boyfriend now. 
She a cop?
---
## AUBREY:
No, I’m not.
---
## HARPER:
I guess we should start with those addresses.
---
## JACKSON:
They’re pickup spots, she wouldn’t stick around.
---
## HARPER:
But nearby.
---
## JACKSON:
Maybe nearby. Who’s she?
---
## AUBREY:
I’m Aubrey.
---
template: overlap
## HARPER:
How long is it before she’s considered missing?

## JACKSON:
But who are you, why are you– can anyone tell me anything?
---
## AUBREY:
The waiting period’s more of a myth. 

We could report her as missing, 
---
template: overlap
but then you’d have authorities to contend with once she’s found.

## JACKSON:
Nope, no cops.
---
## HARPER:
Jackson.
---
## AUBREY:
No, he’s right.
---
## JACKSON:
You sure she’s not a cop?
---
## HARPER:
Why would she agree with you on that point 
---
template: overlap
if she were a cop?

## JACKSON:
Cops play tricks.
---
template: overlap
## AUBREY:
I’m not a cop.

## JACKSON:
Cause you can’t lie about it if you are, I know my rights.
---
## HARPER:
The police could help find her, maybe.
---
template: overlap
## AUBREY:
If she’s carrying any product, they’ll have to detain her.

## HARPER:
Shoot.
---
## JACKSON:
Bunch of sons-of-bitches.
---
---
## HARPER:
I should’ve been checking in on her more.
---
## AUBREY:
I know how you feel right now, 
---
but this is not your fault, hon, I promise you.
---
## HARPER:
I know that. I don’t need comforting.
---
## AUBREY:
–Understood.
---
## JACKSON:
How you know Noah?
---
## HARPER:
Just ignore him.
---
## JACKSON:
Don’t ignore me!
---
## AUBREY:
I… work with addicts, like your girlfriend.
---
## JACKSON:
She can’t afford rehab.
---
## HARPER:
Can we focus on the task at hand, Jackson?
---
## JACKSON:
Ain’t like I haven’t tried, 
---
started saving up money for her to go through one’a those places 
---
a couple years back when she was in a real bad way, 
---
but I had to give it to Jason for his Iraq leg.
---
## AUBREY:
It’s not rehab, but we do help addicts.
---
## JACKSON:
What kinda help you lookin to give?
---
## AUBREY:
You can ask her when you find her.
---
## JACKSON:
I don’t like this. 
---
Secret meetings and she goes off missing, 
---
if you’re the reason she’s gone I’ll–
---
## AUBREY:
Sir. Do not threaten me. 
---
Don’t. Okay?
---
## JACKSON:
–I wasn’t–
---
## AUBREY:
Can I get a verbal affirmation that you understand?
---
## JACKSON:
–Okay.
---
I don’t like strangers.
---
## AUBREY:
And I do not like drug dealers.
---
## JACKSON:
Fine.
---
## AUBREY:
Fine. Frankly, I think you should be focused on 
---
strategies to find your girlfriend at the
moment. 
---
Because even after a short period of detox, 
---
an addict’s tolerance wanes significantly.
---
Her regular dose could now kill her. 
---
She’s overdosed recently, that increases her risk of overdosing again. 
---
The product she’s using could very well be cut with Fentanyl.
---
Her odds do not look so optimal right now, 
---
so I’d suggest you redirect your energy toward 
---
finding her as soon as possible.
---
---
## JACKSON:
I’ll, uh. Head West, toward Cisco Drive.
---
## HARPER:
I’ll take South Williamson, down to Goody.
---
## AUBREY:
Okay. You have a plan, a plan is good.
---
## HARPER:
Call me if–
---
## JACKSON:
Ditto.
---
## AUBREY:
What can I do to help? 
---
I know you’re not asking, I’m just offering.
---
## HARPER:
Ah,
---
## AUBREY:
I could take care of Benny, or–
---
## HARPER:
Benny. Right. Jesus. 
---
I, he’s at school, he’s–
---
## AUBREY:
I’ll pick him up.
---
## HARPER:
He won’t go with a stranger.
---
## AUBREY:
Call a neighbor and have them do it, 
---
I’ll watch him once he’s here.
---
## HARPER:
Maybe it’s a bad idea.
---
## AUBREY:
We’ll play, we’ll have fun. I’m good with kids.
---
## HARPER:
Right.
---
## JACKSON:
What if she’s gone?
---
## HARPER:
Jesus, Jackson.
---
## JACKSON:
She said she’d never leave me, she promised.
---
## HARPER:
If she’s relapsed, she’s probably not thinking about promises.
---
## JACKSON:
But–
---
## HARPER:
I don’t know what to tell you, 
---
you’re not the only one she made promises to.
---
We should go.
---
## AUBREY:
What should I tell Benny? When he gets home.
---
## HARPER:
Benny.
---
Ah. Tell him something good. Try not to lie.
---
---
## AUBREY:
Oh, gosh, hi.
---
## NOAH:
What are you doing here?
---
## AUBREY:
I’ve been watching Benny while–
---
Noah, does your sister know you’re here?
---
## NOAH:
[snorts]
---
## AUBREY:
She’s been scared out of her mind. 
---
So has your boyfriend.
---
## NOAH:
I didn’t wanna see them. 
---
I have a present for Benny.
---
## AUBREY:
Are you high? Look at me.
---
Right, so you’re not going to interact with a child that way.
---
## NOAH:
I’m just. Going to give him a puzzle. I got him a new one.
---
---
## NOAH:
It’s a puzzle of a farm. With cows and pigs.
---
## AUBREY:
Okay, I’m sure he’ll love it in the morning.
---
## NOAH:
I can’t give it to’im in the morning.
---
## AUBREY:
Why’s that?
---
## NOAH:
I can’t stay here. I broke the rules.
---
## AUBREY:
I think your sister cares more that you’re safe–
---
## NOAH:
I don’t wanna stay here.
---
## AUBREY:
Noah, why would you– what’s the appeal of disappearing?
---
## NOAH:
I doubt you’d get it.
---
## AUBREY:
I, you’re right, I don’t. 
---
I actually really don’t but I do get what it does to a family.
---
How every single time you wait and wait 
---
and pray that they’ll come back. 
---
And then one time they don’t, and I get how that feels too.
---
I mean, aren’t you ever scared? 
---
That you won’t come back?
---
---
## NOAH:
I’m sorry about your kid.
---
## AUBREY:
Thank you.
---
## NOAH:
But you’re not my mom. 
---
So um I don’t mean to be rude 
---
but this is actually none of your goddamn business.
---
## AUBREY:
Professionally, honey, it is my business.
---
## NOAH:
Then stop calling me honey. 
---
And stop trying to connect with me 
---
or whatever and ask about my life like you care, 
---
like I’m not just a new walking testimonial for your website 
---
or your stupid pamphlet or. Whatever.
---
---
## AUBREY:
You’re right, I was trying to connect with you, 
---
but why is that a bad thing?
---
## NOAH:
I think what you do is gross.
---
## AUBREY:
Okay.
---
## NOAH:
No more moms, no more kids, that don’t make sense.
---
## AUBREY:
It’s, as I said it’s not a perfect solution /but–
---
## NOAH:
It ain’t a solution at all, not to this!
---
## AUBREY:
There are no solutions to this problem, then, okay? 
---
Not really! The only solution is you stop,
---
you get clean 
---
and I’m sorry but the odds of that happening are just not good enough 
---
to do nothing and watch as you hurt the people around you. 
---
As you hurt your son. 
---
It’s a privilege to be a mother, Noah.
---
## NOAH:
That’s enough.
---
## AUBREY:
And some of us didn’t have a say in giving up a child.
---
## NOAH:
I said that’s enough.
---
---
## AUBREY:
Okay, that’s–there’s no need for that.
---
## NOAH:
Let me see my goddamn kid.
---
## AUBREY:
How about this, okay, okay? 
---
Let me– ask you a few questions. 
---
You answer them and– y’know
what, you answer them and you can pass. 
---
And I’ll give up on your case, 
---
I’ll have done what I can.
---
## NOAH:
I don’t need to answer your stupid–
---
## AUBREY:
Harper said you’ve been thinking about having children. 
---
More children, ones you’re involved in raising this time.
---
## NOAH:
That the first question? Yup.
---
## AUBREY:
No, my question is when?
---
And how does it fit into your sobriety timeline? 
---
By the way– second question– what is that sobriety timeline? 
---
How do you intend on getting clean indefinitely? 
---
Or would there be any question of you relapsing after kids come around? 
---
And in that case– what, would Harper adopt more? 
---
Or would Jackson take a long enough break from dealing heroin 
---
to take care of them on his own? 
---
Incidentally– what happens to the kids when he gets arrested? 
---
Or killed,potentially.
---
And with Jackson still around, or not, 
---
what if something goes wrong for you and you want to use? 
---
You get in a fight at work, or you see a deal in action 
---
on the way to pick up your kid from school. 
---
Do you keep driving? Or do you stop? 
---
It’s so easy, finding it here, isn’t it? 
---
You have all those numbers now. 
---
Even if you never source from Jackson ever again, 
---
you know where you could find it. 
---
Even if you move to a different town, 
---
you know what kind of people to look out for. 
---
They know how to look out for you, for that matter.
---
## NOAH:
Stop.
---
## AUBREY:
Or, forget all those questions, 
---
you’ve had, what, four years to get to know your birth son?
---
One of those, you were sober, even, right?
---
Tell me anything meaningful about him. 
---
I got to spend a few hours with him tonight, 
---
sweet kid, bright kid. 
---
Open book. Tell me his first word. 
---
What kinds of dreams he has, what he draws in class, 
---
who his friends in pre-K are.
---
---
## NOAH:
He likes puzzles.
---
## AUBREY:
Right. What else?
---
---
## NOAH:
Christ.
---
You really believe in what you do, huh?
---
## AUBREY:
I believe in doing something to make a difference. 
---
This isn’t always pleasant. 
---
But it makes a difference, so I do it.
---
## NOAH:
Maybe we should. Start over, or.
---
It’s just so hard for me to trust people…
---
## AUBREY:
I get it. I totally get it.
---
## NOAH:
I believe you.
---
Maybe I could. Make us a cup of coffee, and.
---
## AUBREY:
And I can call your sister,
---
## NOAH:
And we can just talk?
---
## AUBREY:
Honey, I’d love that.
---
---
## AUBREY:
Noah, NOAH. 
---
LET ME IN LET ME–
---
## NOAH:
Shhh. He’s sleeping.
---
---
## JACKSON:
Noah? Baby, it’s me.
---
## NOAH:
Hi Jackson.
---
## JACKSON:
Can you just come out?
---
## NOAH:
I’m not leaving until you promise you won’t take him away.
---
## HARPER:
Oh this is not the time to make an ultimatum, Noah.
---
## JACKSON:
Baby, you disappeared on me, what was that about?
---
## NOAH:
It don’t have to do with you.
---
## JACKSON:
You have to do with me!
---
## NOAH:
Shh he’s sleeping.
---
## HARPER:
This feels a lot like a threat, Noah.
---
## NOAH:
Ain’t a threat.
---
## HARPER:
Just get out of there and we can talk like adults.
---
## NOAH:
Are you mad?
---
## HARPER:
Of course I’m mad.
---
## NOAH:
You’re mean when you’re mad.
---
## AUBREY:
I still think you should break down the door.
---
## HARPER:
I don’t want to frighten Benny.
---
## NOAH:
What’re y’all sayin?
---
## HARPER:
Come out here and we can say it to you directly.
---
## NOAH:
Benny should see me. I’m his, he should see me.
---
## HARPER:
We’ll talk about it.
---
## NOAH:
Stop lying.
---
## HARPER:
You’re only making things worse, 
---
the longer you’re in there.
---
---
## JACKSON:
What’s she doing?
---
## HARPER:
She’s doing a puzzle.
---
## NOAH:
He likes to see it made before he does it himself.
---
## HARPER:
Noah I swear to– you get out of there.
---
## AUBREY:
Nothing has to change if you come out now.
---
## NOAH:
That’s not true.
---
## AUBREY:
It is! 
---
No one’s going to punish you. 
---
Mistakes happen, your sister understands.
---
## HARPER:
I do?
---
## AUBREY:
Benny’s safety matters most. You just need her out.
---
## NOAH:
You’re lying.
---
## HARPER:
Nope, she’s not.
---
---
## HARPER:
I won’t cut you off from Benny, okay? 
---
Just come out.
---
## NOAH:
I never got to watch him sleep. 
---
I ain’t been alone with him since he was born.
---
## HARPER:
I know.
---
## NOAH:
That makes me sad. It makes me mad.
---
## HARPER:
I get it. We can talk about it.
---
## AUBREY:
Just unlock the door, hon.
---
## HARPER:
Please.
---
## NOAH:
You won’t take him away?
---
## HARPER:
–No.
---
---
## JACKSON:
Noah they’re lyin to you.
---
## HARPER:
Jackson what the hell is wrong with you?!
---
## JACKSON:
She deserves to know. 
---
I don’t want her lied to, that’s not love.
---
## AUBREY:
Oh my God.
---
## JACKSON:
She deserves someone here who wants what’s best for her.
---
## HARPER:
And that’s you? 
---
Her boyfriend who got her hooked on heroin, 
---
you goddamn imbecile?
---
## NOAH:
You’re swearing.
---
## HARPER:
You’re right, Noah, I’m swearing, 

I’m gonna break a few of my own rules when my junkie sister is hiding with my son 

in his goddamn bedroom and I’m having to deal with her 
---

idiotic–

## NOAH:
You called me a junkie.
---
---
## NOAH:
Do you think I’m a–
---
## HARPER:
You gave up after a week. 
---
How does that look, Noah, 
---
look at it from where I’m standing. 
---
You want the truth, you want things said straight, 
---
then honestly, I’m– disappointed.
---
## NOAH:
You hate me?
---
## HARPER:
I don’t hate you.
---
I’m sad is all. And scared. 
---
Benny’s in there.

## NOAH:
I’m not gonna do anything to’im.
---
He just looks so peaceful asleep like that.
---
## HARPER:
So let him sleep. 
---
And unlock the door, and come out here with me. 
---
Please?
---
Noah is silent.
---
## JACKSON:
You okay, baby?
---
## HARPER:
Say something.
---
Noah?
---
---
## NOAH:
Um.

Benny’s uh he’s sort of shakin -what should–

You need to open the door right now.

## JACKSON:
I can break it open if y’all need me to.

## NOAH:
He won’t let me hold him why won’t–

## HARPER:
Open the door, now.
---
template: noise
soothing sounds
---
---
## HARPER:
Out of courtesy, 
---
I’m going to walk you through what’s going to happen.
---
You kidnapped Benny.
---
## JACKSON:
You can’t kidnap your own kid.
---
## AUBREY:
You can if you don’t have custody.
---
## HARPER:
You held him hostage, is maybe a more accurate way of putting it 
---
and you did it while there
was heroin in your system 
---
so obviously I have legal precedent to keep you away from him indefinitely, 
---
I could get a formal restraining order but I won’t do that because. 
---
I don’t think it’s necessary, I think you know you can’t see him for a long time, 
---
I hope you know that, 
---
I hope you’re sober enough to grasp 
---
that you just bought yourself separation from your birth son
---
until you’re one year clean, whenever that is.
---
## JACKSON:
She was scared you’d–
---
## HARPER:
Do not interrupt me 
---
or I will send you to jail for trafficking drugs.
---
I am grateful that you are alive and that you survived this, 
---
but I do not trust you anymore. 
---
Not just with Benny, at all. 
---
You’ll be moving out, obviously, I assume back
in with Jackson 
---
but I do not care, as long as you are not here.
---
## NOAH:
Harper–
---
## HARPER:
Jackson will help you get your things out now.
---
## NOAH:
Harper please look at me.
---
## HARPER:
I think you owe Aubrey an apology before she leaves, 
---
I mean you attacked the woman, you could have seriously hurt her, 
---
I think you owe everyone here except probably Jackson an apology 
---
but I’m not interested in empty words or promises anymore.
---
---
## NOAH:
I’m sorry.
---
## AUBREY:
I appreciate that.
---
## NOAH:
I didn’t mean to hurt you. 
If I did.
---
## AUBREY:
I’m fine.
---
## JACKSON:
Honeybee, you don’t have to be here if you don’t want to.
---
## NOAH:
Wait.
---
Harper can we talk for a second.
---
## HARPER:
I don’t think I want to do that, no.
---
## NOAH:
Harper look at me please.
---
## JACKSON:
I’ll get your stuff and bring it out.
---
## NOAH:
Can you wait in the car? I just need a minute.
---
## JACKSON:
–Sure, baby.
---
## AUBREY:
I’m gonna be on my way, then.
---
## HARPER:
You should go too.
---
## NOAH:
I can fix this. 
---
I just need to think for a–

## HARPER:
You can think about all this when you are out of my home.
---
## NOAH:
I’ll do it.
---
Harper I’ll do it.
---
---
## HARPER:
What?
---
## NOAH:
The surgery. The thing.
---
I’ll do it.
---
## NOAH:
And the money, it’ll all go to Benny. 
---
You said he needs help you can’t give him, 
---
therapy and uh medicine, tutors to help him learn what doesn’t come natural. 
---
You decide how to use it but
it goes to Benny. 
---
I’ll do a good thing for him.
---
## AUBREY:
I think you’re making the responsible choice. I really do.
---
## NOAH:
I don’t know if it’s fair but it’s right. 
---
I think it’s right.
---
What you said to me. 
---
I don’t have the right answers. 
---
I don’t see that far ahead, I
don’t know what I’d do.
---
## AUBREY:
That makes sense, hon.
---
## NOAH:
I wanna know. I wanna know I can be good.
---
## AUBREY:
I can take you to the doctor I’ve been in contact with as soon as his office is open.
---
## HARPER:
Hold on, wait. 
---
This is all fast, this is– maybe we should–
---
## NOAH:
This could fix it.
---
## HARPER:
What did you say to her?
---
## AUBREY:
Nothing that wasn’t true.
---
People like us give and give until we have nothing left, Harper.
---
## HARPER:
People like us?
---
## AUBREY:
Victims of other people’s circumstances.
---
## HARPER:
Noah, we should have a conversation about this 
---
if you’re serious about– 
---
you don’t have to decide all at once,
---
## AUBREY:
Let her make a good decision. 
---
Let her help.
---
## NOAH:
I can give Benny a good thing.
---
## BENNY:
Mama?
