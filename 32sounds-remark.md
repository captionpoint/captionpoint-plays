Hello, everybody. Good evening.

Okay, so tonight

---

JD and Michael are going to play<br>
a bunch of music for you.

I'm going to cue<br>
32 different sounds

from this computer.

I'll show some images,<br>
I'll talk some,

and together,

maybe even with a little help<br>
from you all,

we're going to make<br>
a documentary film about sound.

---


---

Before we get started,

---

I just want to mention<br>
that we'll be switching

---

between two kinds<br>
of feelings tonight.

---

First there's the magic<br>
of cinema —

---

That feeling of sitting<br>
in a theater full of strangers

---

seeing a movie and<br>
having a collective experience together. 

---

Well, we'll have that.

---

But then there's also that<br>
intimate feeling

---

when you're listening<br>
to something on headphones 

---

and you're totally alone<br>
in the world.

---

We're going to have that too.

---

This is that first<br>
modality here,

---

the collective<br>
experience of cinema.

---

You can hear the speakers<br>
on the right over here...

---

and you can hear the speakers<br>
over on the left over there...

---

We're all here<br>
in this room,

---

and hopefully we'll go <br>
somewhere together.

---

And now -

---

Let's go into that other<br>
modality, headphones,

---

and get started.

---

On the count of 8,

---

let's all put on our <br>
headphones now.

This is our first sound,<br>
sound #1,

---

the sound of the womb.

---

[rhythmic thumping
and gurgling]

---

I read an essay by Walter Murch,

---

in which he claims that

---

in this place where we all<br>
started out,

---

sound is the first sense<br>
we develop.

---

At four months old<br>
you can hear all of this,

---

but you still can't<br>
see or taste.

---

In the womb,

---

we are alone,<br>
but connected to the world

---

through sound.

---

[repeating pattern of thumps]

---

It made me wonder<br>
if this is why sound

---

has such a strange power.

---

As I was making this film,

---

a lot of people asked me,<br>
"Why sound?"

---

And to be honest,

---

I never really had<br>
a clear answer.

---

All I could say is that

---

<i>something</i> was driving me<br>
to make this movie,

---

even if I couldn't say<br>
exactly what.

In that box there's also<br>

SAM: The Moho Braccatus<br>
was a little Hawaiian bird

that was decimated<br>
by development

in the last century.

By the 1980s, there were only<br>
two of these birds left...

a male and a female.

So there was still hope.

Then,

in 1982,<br>
a hurricane struck

and killed the female.

only one bird left...

the male.

OLD TIMEY HOST: What is involved<br>

a very common sound.

at the journey<br>
<i>this</i> sound will take

from JD's whoopee cushion<br>
to your mind.

---

HOST:
...as the eardrum vibrates...

---

SAM:
Step one.

---

When JD squeezes<br>
the whoopee cushion,

---

there's a little valve<br>
that vibrates

---

and sends out ripples of air.

---

Step two.

---

Some of these vibrations<br>
enter your ear canal,

---

bounce off your eardrum,

---

and then vibrate<br>
three tiny bones.

---

These are the smallest bones<br>
in your entire body.

---

Step three.

---

The signal moves on<br>
to your cochlea,

---

which is a tube<br>
filled with fluid.

---

And this is where<br>
it gets really next level.

---

In the cochlea,

---

this sound becomes something<br>
completely new,

---

it transforms from a kind of<br>
mechanical vibration

---

into an electrical signal<br>
that shoots deep into your brain

---

and then becomes<br>
a thought, an idea.

---

You say to yourself,<br>
"Ah! The sound of a fart!"

♪ [xylophone melody<br>

♪ [contemplative xylophone<br>

---

So back in the 1800s,

---

when people were starting<br>
to figure all this stuff out,

---

Charles Babbage was a<br>
mathematician, scientist,

---

theologian, philosopher,

---

and all around smart guy.

---

In fact, he invented...

---

the computer.

---

But he thought a lot<br>
about sound

---

and he came<br>
to a scientific conclusion

---

that since sound is<br>
fundamentally just vibrations

---

like ripples on the water,

---

then all the sounds<br>
in the world

---

should still be bouncing around<br>
out there somewhere,

---

just super quiet.

---

He thought that with<br>
the right <i>receiving machine</i>,

---

and the right kind<br>
of <i>decoding technology</i>,

---

we should be able<br>
to listen again

---

to every conversation and joke,

---

every declaration of love

---

or angry words ever spoken.

---

It should all be out there.

---

He wrote, quote,

---

"The air itself<br>
is one vast library

---

"on whose pages<br>
are forever written

---

"all that man has ever said

---

or woman whispered."

---


---

Charles Babbage wrote that<br>
in 1837.

---

And I guess<br>
the implication is that,

---

if he ever said <br>
these words aloud,

---

they too should still<br>
be out there somewhere,

---

tiny ripples vibrating

---

along with<br>
all these other moments.

SAM (OFF-CAMERA): So basically,<br>
just what <i>are</i> you doing?

---

ANNEA: [chuckling]<br>
I'm listening to what -

---

to a whole other world<br>
down there.

---

I mean, when I first<br>
put a hydrophone into a river,

---

which was the Danube,

---

I was astonished by how much<br>
was happening there

---

and how much was totally<br>
inaudible at the surface.

---

Or another way of<br>
thinking about it is,

---

how <i>very</i> different<br>
the surface world of a river is

---

from the underwater world<br>
of a river

---

and how <i>rich</i><br>
that underwater world was.

---

It was astounding.<br>
Whether it was...

---

aquatic insects,

---

bugs, fish

---

that I was hearing<br>
or whether it was just

---

the play of the currents<br>
underwater,

---

which are delicious

---

and make the most<br>
beautiful sounds.

---

I always say they have<br>
lovely phrasing, they do!

---

They're musical.

something, if he's able to.

from the reeds to myself,<br>
or the bugs to myself

and undoubtedly back again,<br>
somehow or other.

---

stereo.

---

Alan Blumlein had been<br>
frustrated at movies,

---

because the sound of the actors

---

always came out<br>
of a center speaker,

---

He was inspired to invent stereo<br>
so that the sound could move

---

from left to right<br>
or right to left,

---

could move in space<br>
as the actors themselves did.

---

It was a giant leap forward<br>
in sonic realism.

a few years ago,<br>

---

But nobody's using this<br>
in films yet

'cause they can't figure out<br>
how to do it.

Speakers don't really work

spatial sound technology.

What's special<br>
about Johann Kristoff

is his microphones<br>

It's designed to capture sound<br>
exactly how you hear it.

---

SAM: What is spatial sound<br>
first of all?

---

For people who don't -

---

[overlapping]

Most people have heard<br>
of surround sound.

So surround sound<br>
envelops you with sound.

In real life,

Spatial sound is technology

I can almost hear,

you, you -

you lose the possibility<br>
of hearing them again.

thrust into this reality of,<br>
in a weird way,

almost hearing them<br>
all the time.

it's a... it's...

went somewhere

completely unexpected and deep.

And in my torn up<br>

his words got me.

HAROLD: I hope they never<br>
take off the fog horns.

They, uh...

provide a sense of people

who are asleep or half asleep

---

or somehow staying up at night,<br>
[distant foghorns]

---

giving them a sense of the bay,

that there are ships<br>
out there on the bay,

that the ocean is rolling<br>
out there.

And that the earth is turning.

---

This whole process of being<br>
part of this total

and non-life on Earth

---

is a very,<br>
can be a very intense,

that it's hard to describe.

I was talking to my friend

who's a huge Hollywood<br>
sound designer

---

about how much better headphones<br>
are than speakers,

---

and he said,

---

"But headphones<br>
don't do under 80 cycles."

---

I said, "What's 80 cycles?"

---

And he said, "All that<br>
super low end stuff,

---

"the kind of sound<br>
that hits you in the gut."

---

[low frequency buzz]<br>
And I thought, Oh yeah!

---

If we are thinking of sound<br>
in an expansive sense,

---

if we're using sound<br>
to understand something

---

about the odd experience<br>
of being alive,

---

then considering how sound<br>
not only goes in your ears

---

but hits your whole body<br>
if it's low enough

---

seems important.

---

So I figured<br>
now we could do something

---

with these big subwoofers<br>
over there.

---

And I was thinking of things

---

that involve a lot of<br>
really low end sound,

---

and then I realized:

---

big sounds that move your body?

---

That's what DJs do.

---

That's what being in a club

---

and losing yourself in sound<br>
is all about.

---

And we have a world famous DJ<br>
right here.

that sounds never die,

a great comfort in the idea

that it's all still out there.

with Newtonian physics

hearing all those voices

"would be too much.<br>

"those people were here<br>

"over and over at each show,<br>

actually holds a person

coming from over there.

And it sounds like a solitary -

solitary insect.

Solitary singer -<br>
It's, it's really nice.

Just every so often.

Evening sharpens one's senses,<br>
I think.

The human world essentially<br>
quieting down to some extent,

enough to be satisfying.

The human world<br>
quieting down,

And this -<br>
this other world

sort of slowly coming in<br>
like...

like mist.

Almost imperceptibly...

coming in.

SAM: I was curious about this,<br>
Annea,

---

'cause when I interviewed you<br>
over the phone,

---

- Mmm?<br>
- I asked you

---

if you were listening to music<br>
and you said "No."

---

- Yeah. T--<br>
- Because it was too intense.

---

- Yeah.<br>
- But you said you are

---

going out on your deck<br>
and listening to the world.

---

- Yeah.<br>
- I just, I love that image.

---

I thought that was very moving,<br>
and so...

---

That's why I wanted to film you.<br>
- Thank you. Thank you.

---

Yeah, it's been,<br>
it's taken a while

---

for me to come back<br>
to listening to music

---

because it moves me<br>
far too much, you know,

---

because it's so,<br>
so intrinsically associated

---

with our life together.

---

And Ruth died<br>
in November of last year.

---

So it's been a process of...<br>
learning what that means.

---

And, and music<br>
just gets to me so fast.

---

But little by little.

---

SAM: But the sound of the...

---

world -<br>
- Ah. Yeah...

---

- is soothing?

---


---

- Ah...

---

The easiest thing to say is,<br>
it's where I live.

---

So it's home.

---


---

So yes,<br>
I suppose it is soothing.
