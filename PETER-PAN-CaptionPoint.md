  For Peter Pan on Her 70th Birthday
]

---

## ANN:
Hello. I'll be playing Peter Pan.

---

This is something of a relic.

---

## ANN:
Peter Pan, presented by the Davenport Children's Theatre in Davenport, Iowa, 1955.

---

Let's see...

---

## ANN:
Mr. Smee—played by Bump Heeter.

---

Tinker Bell—played by herself, of course.

---

## ANN:
Mrs. Darling—Mary Ellen Hurlbutt—oh my God she was in my wedding.

---

When she was still a Hurlbutt. We used to call her Fling Fanny.

---

## ANN:
Our first production was at the Shriner's temple, a big building on Brady Street,

---

where the Shriners did mysterious things.

---

## ANN:
Then we upgraded to the Orpheum, a real movie theater, where Mary Martin once performed.

---

I met her when she came through town.

---

## ANN:
Mom took me behind the proscenium to her dressing room...It was thrilling.

---

Our picture was taken for the local paper and she signed my script:

---

## ANN:
"To Ann, Peter Pan, with love, Mary Martin, Peter."

---

I was so flustered. I forgot my script in the dressing room

---

## ANN:
and so she sent down my script and a bouquet of flowers.

---

.center[**MOVEMENT ONE**]

---

## ANN:
What's a five-letter word for a public square in Greece?

---

## JOHN:
Piazza.

---

## MICHAEL:
That would be six letters and Italian.

---

## JOHN:
Well I was close. Pizza—

---

## JIM:
—is five letters. And food.

---

## JOHN:
Anyone hungry?

---

## ANN:
Agora! Yes! I wonder if that's related to agonal breathing—

---

## JIM:
agonal—

---

## ANN:
Oh, in rhetorical theory it's agonal—

---

## JIM:
Well, in medicine it's agonal.

---

## WENDY:
Can you pass me the lotion?

---

## ANN:
I wonder what the etymology is—agon—struggle—

---

## MICHAEL:
Maybe it's agony for people to meet in a public square.

---

## ANN:
Isn't it the heart of our democracy?

---

## JIM:
Democracy is agony. At least, at the present moment—when the White House is occupied by Slick Willy—

---

## ANN:
Must we refer to our president as Slick Willy?

---

## WENDY:
Let's not start—

---

## ANN:
Eight down—To move laterally... eight letters—anyone?

---

## MICHAEL:
Sidle—no—that's five—

---

## JIM:
Slither—no seven—they always like those overly clever puns—

---

maybe something football related—like a lateral pass—speaking of, is the Notre Dame game on?

---

## MICHAEL:
Think so.

---

## JOHN:
I don't think so, I know so.

---

## JIM:
Anyone mind?

---

## MICHAEL:
Dad would probably want to hear it.

---

## WENDY:
Could you mute it?

---

## ANN:
Shuffle? No—

---

## MICHAEL:
How many letters again?

---

## ANN:
Eight.

---

## MICHAEL:
A medical term? Lateral meniscus—no—

---

## ANN:
Sidestep! Last week I finally finished a New York Times Sunday crossword puzzle all by myself.

---

Probably because it was easy.

---

## WENDY:
Don't diminish yourself.

---

## ANN:
No I'm really not very good at them.

---

## JOHN:
We all know you got the highest SAT scores, Annie—You don't need to be self-deprecating—

---

## MICHAEL:
I think they're tattooed on your arm somewhere—see right there—

---

## ANN:
Oh stop it—

---

## JIM:
And now that you have your PhD in—what is it?

---

## ANN:
Rhetoric—

---

## JIM:
Rhetoric, right—Now you'll be indomitable—

---

## WENDY:
Now I'm the only one in the family who's not a doctor—

---

## JIM:
I'm not a doctor.

---

## WENDY:
But you teach at a college—don't they call you professor?

---

## JOHN:
Sometimes.

---

## ANN:
Anyway, I had a lot of answers for free because it was about the Beatles—

---

## JIM:
"Can't buy me love... love..."

---

## ALL:
"Can't buy me lo–ove–huuuuuuuhhhhh..."

---

## WENDY:
Remember how you boys had that bus and you called the "buh"

---

and you would play the Beatles and drive around and pick up girls on the bus?

---

## WENDY:
I would never have gotten away with that. Mom and Dad had such a double standard for girls.

---

## JOHN:
Oh I think you got away with plenty.

---

## JIM:
What quarter is it?

---

## JOHN:
Fourth.

---

## ANN:
Remember how nervous Dad used to get at Jim's football games?

---

He was like a maniac, chewing gum and pacing the sidelines—

---

## JIM:
Yeah.

---

## MICHAEL:
He never came to my games.

---

## JOHN:
Well you weren't All American—

---

## MICHAEL:
Well, we all know I wasn't terribly athletic. I did however get to go to the state championship one year in golf

---

and Dad said: "I'm not coming. Whenever I watch you play you play badly

---

## MICHAEL:
and I want you to play well."

---

## ANN:
So he didn't come?

---

## MICHAEL:
No.

---

## WENDY:
That's terrible.

---

## ANN:
Did you play well?

---

## MICHAEL:
I was heroic.

---

## ANN:
Dad?

---

## MICHAEL:
I'll get the doctor.

---

## JIM:
I'll go.

---

## MICHAEL:
What'd he say?

---

## JIM:
Dad's regular doctor is on vacation. The guy covering said: "The order's written for morphine PRN."

---

## WENDY:
What does that mean?

---

## JIM:
He said: "If your dad is in pain, we can up the dosage of morphine.

---

Otherwise, we'll just have to wait.

---

## JIM:
I understand your situation, I went through this with my own family.

---

But there are euthanasia laws in the state of Iowa. And this is a Catholic hospital."

---

## MICHAEL:
What an asshole.

---

## ANN:
What is he accusing us of?

---

## MICHAEL:
Of being less than Catholic because we asked for morphine.

---

## ANN:
I hate this.

---

## JOHN:
We all hate this.

---

## JIM:
I can't believe I've practiced medicine for thirty years only to be reduced to one bureaucratic order

---

written by an out-of-town doctor while my father is dying.

---

## WENDY:
So, what does that mean, practically speaking?

---

## JIM:
It means we say he's in pain every hour and the nurse will up the dosage.

---

## WENDY:
Isn't that sort of—like—

---

## MICHAEL:
What?

---

## ANN:
You know—

---

## MICHAEL:
No—

---

## ANN:
Like we're killing him?

---

## JIM:
No, we're giving palliative care which this hospital is too screwed up to do.

---

## ANN:
My rational sense tells me it's okay, the morphine, but emotionally—

---

## MICHAEL:
Annie—

---

## ANN:
You both know better than I do, being doctors—and in some ways, it's worse for you—

---

having to handle the medical side of things—when it's your own father—

---

## ANN:
but it just doesn't seem—right—

---

## JIM:
He's in pain, Annie.

---

## JOHN:
Now look, Annie, I've been taking care of Dad for the last two years,

---

and I know when he's in pain.

---

## JOHN:
He's in a lot of pain right now. He would want us to help him.

---

## MICHAEL:
He's not walking out of here, Annie. I'm sorry.

---

## WENDY:
I'm with Ann. What's your rush? He'll let go when he's ready.

---

## JIM:
It's not about rushing, my God. It's about staying ahead of the pain.

---

.center[**MOVEMENT TWO**]

---

## MICHAEL:
Let's have another.

---

## JIM:
What's an Irish wake without Jameson's—

---

## ANN:
A wake should have a body shouldn't it—so weird to leave the hospital—

---

to leave the body—Like we were abandoning him...

---

## WENDY:
Without a ritual...

---

## ANN:
Yes.

---

## MICHAEL:
I meant let's have another joke—but I'll keep the whiskey, thank you very much.

---

## JOHN:
Anyone got another joke?

---

## MICHAEL:
I do. An internist dies and goes to Heaven, as you would expect after a lifetime of selfless service to mankind...

---

## JIM:
Yeah, yeah—

---

## MICHAEL:
Anyway, St. Peter is taking him on an orientation tour, showing him the golf course, the fitness center—

---

## JOHN:
Is there a hot tub?

---

## MICHAEL:
Absolutely. Anyway, it's time for lunch so they go to the heavenly cafeteria and stand in a long line.

---

Soon, a man with a long flowing beard, wearing scrubs and surgical clogs, with a stethoscope around his neck,

---

## MICHAEL:
comes in and goes right to the front of the line.

---

The internist asks St. Peter, "Who the hell is that guy?"

---

## MICHAEL:
St. Peter responds, "Oh, that's God, he just thinks he's a surgeon."

---

## JIM:
That's right! To God!

---

## JOHN:
You tell one, Ann—

---

## ANN:
I can never remember jokes. Is that a woman thing?

---

## JIM:
Yes. Just kidding.

---

## ANN:
Hilarious. Maybe I never learned jokes because I didn't go to medical school.

---

## MICHAEL:
It's true. We did learn jokes in medical school.

---

.center[**MOVEMENT THREE - Neverland**]

---

## ANN:
It's my last night in the nursery...

---

## WENDY:
It's my last night in the nursery you know. Peter Pan is coming tonight.

---

Father says Peter Pan isn't real, but I know he is. I just know he is!

---

## WENDY:
He's going to take me to—where?

---

## ANN:
Neverland!

---

## WENDY:
Neverland!

---

## ANN:
Wendy!

---

## WENDY:
Peter Pan!

---

## ANN:
The lost boys need a mother. Are you ready to come to Neverland?

---

## WENDY:
Why isn't that awfully far away?

---

Oh, it's Tinker Bell!

---

## ANN:
Tink! Tink! Now you behave yourself, Tink, and don't pull Wendy's hair!

---

## WENDY:
John! Michael! Wake up! Look it's a fairy!

---

## MICHAEL AND JOHN:
A fairy!

---

## ANN:
Time is a wasting! Let's go to Neverland!

---

## WENDY:
But how will I get there? I can't fly!

---

## ANN:
Fairy dust!

---

## WENDY:
Oh!

---

## ANN:
But Wendy I lost my shadow!

---

Do you have it, Wendy? I can't fly without my shadow!

---

## MICHAEL:
Where did you lose it?

---

## JOHN:
What does it look like?

---

## ANN:
Well, it's dark—

---

## WENDY:
Here it is, Peter! I found it!

---

## ANN:
Oh Wendy, bless you! But how will I get it back on?

---

## WENDY:
I can sew your shadow back on.

---

## ANN:
Do you have a sewing machine?

---

## WENDY:
Needle and thread!

---

## ANN:
I can do it.

---

## WENDY:
I can do it.

---

## ANN:
I know how to sew.

---

## WENDY:
So do I. Mom taught me.

---

## ANN:
No, Mom taught me.

---

## WENDY:
Mom taught me. You're Peter Pan. You don't have a mother. And you don't know how to sew.

---

## ANN:
Right, I'm Peter Pan.

---

## WENDY:
I've been sending you letters, you know.

---

## ANN:
We can't get letters in Neverland, Wendy. I don't have an address!

---

## WENDY:
Now, Peter! I can't sew your shadow on while you're crowing.

---

Everything has a shadow, Peter Pan.

---

## WENDY:
Honestly you should have gone to Jungian analysis. You would have learned that you can't experience joy without your dark side.

---

## ANN:
I don't know what you just said, Wendy.

---

## WENDY:
You can live on Freud until you're forty but when you're seventy and facing death you either need religion or Carl Jung.

---

## ANN:
Why can't I fly without my shadow?

---

## JOHN:
Think about it, Peter.

---

## ANN:
What?

---

## JOHN:
A plane that's flying without its shadow on the ground is—

---

## ANN:
Is what—

---

## JOHN:
Poof—dead!

---

## ANN:
Or just flying at night!

---

## WENDY:
I've sewn it on, Peter.

---

## ANN:
Oh, well done! It's on again, my shadow is on again!

---

Now I can fly!

---

## JOHN:
That was the worst flying I ever saw, Peter.

---

## ANN:
Sorry. I'm afraid—

---

## MICHAEL:
What—you afraid, Peter Pan?

---

## ANN:
I'm not afraid. My foot hurts.

---

## JOHN:
Then I'll fly.

---

Ouch.

---

## MICHAEL:
I'll do it.

---

## JOHN:
Oh. We're old, aren't we? We're getting too old to fly?

---

## MICHAEL:
One of my best friends just died.

---

## WENDY:
Me too.

---

## MICHAEL:
And I had to treat him.

---

## JOHN:
They're all getting old and dying. It's awful.

---

## ANN:
No! Keep a positive attitude. We'll walk to Neverland.

---

Except my foot is killing me.

---

## ANN:
Could someone grab me a cane? How far a walk is Neverland?

---

## WENDY:
Why Peter, you can't walk there!

---

## ANN:
Right. Come! Just think wonderful thoughts and they'll lift you up into the air!

---

March!

---

## ANN:
"Oh when the saints, oh when the saints, oh when the saints go marching in..."

---

## JOHN:
It's Neverland!

---

## MICHAEL AND WENDY:
Neverland!

---

## JOHN:
There's the volcano!

---

## MICHAEL:
There's the Jolly Roger!

---

## WENDY:
It's so beautiful!

---

## ANN:
Sometimes I get panic attacks when I first get to Neverland. Don't worry, it's nothing.

---

Just, I hate travel. Airports, train stations, flying...

---

## WENDY:
Breathe, Peter, deep breaths.

---

## ANN:
Maybe we shouldn't have come.

---

## JOHN:
The sun is out. Let's play shadow tag. Peter, you're it.

---

## ANN:
Gotcha, you're it Michael!

---

## MICHAEL:
Run, run, I'm it!

---

## JOHN:
Look at my top hat in the shadow!

---

## WENDY:
I'm standing on your head.

---

## JOHN:
Get off of my head.

---

## WENDY:
My shadow is so short!

---

## JOHN:
My shadow is so long! My shadow is longer than your shadow!

---

## MICHAEL:
Is not!

---

## JOHN:
Is too!

---

## WENDY:
I didn't know it was a competition!

---

## ANN:
When I turn around my shadow turns with me!

---

Oh—dizzy—

---

## ALL:
Oh...

---

## ANN:
I can't see anyone's shadow!

---

## WENDY:
It's because of the clouds!

---

## ANN:
Well we can't play if we can't see each other's shadows. Anyway, my foot hurts.

---

## MICHAEL:
Let me look at it.

---

## ANN:
It's not the diabetes, it's the gout.

---

## MICHAEL:
When you first feel a twinge, you have to take an anti-inflammatory. You have to stay ahead of the pain.

---

## ANN:
I don't like taking ibuprofen, it causes bleeds.

---

## JOHN:
Where is Hook? I'll fight him! I'd love to kill a pirate! Ha! Ha!

---

## MICHAEL:
Where are the lost boys?

---

## JOHN:
We are the lost boys.

---

## ANN:
Wendy, you don't know how lucky you are to have had a mother.

---

## WENDY:
I miss her!

---

## ANN:
Oh, don't cry, Wendy! I can't stand it when you cry!

---

## MICHAEL:
I don't want to grow up.

---

## JOHN:
I don't want to grow up either!

---

## WENDY:
I want my mother! I want my father!

---

## MICHAEL:
Me Too!

---

## JOHN:
Me too!

---

## JOHN, MICHAEL, AND WENDY:
We don't want to grow up!

---

## ANN:
I can't stand it! Tinker Bell!

---

Make them stop crying!

---

How? Oh! Fairy dust!

---

## ANN:
Well, that's a relief. Thanks, Tink. Now, line up. According to age.

---

You here, you here, you here.

---

## WENDY:
Where do you go, Peter?

---

## ANN:
I'm the oldest, so I go here.

---

## WENDY:
How can you be the oldest, Peter, if you don't grow up?

---

## ANN:
I'm the oldest because I am the oldest.

---

## JOHN:
Now what?

---

## WENDY:
Happy birthday, Peter Pan.

---

## ANN:
Is it my birthday?

---

## ALL BUT ANN:
Are you one are you two are you three are you four?

---

## ANN:
I don't know. I'm quite young though. How old am I?

---

## JOHN:
Seventy, I think!

---

## ANN:
No! That can't be right! This is Neverland!

---

## WENDY:
Happy birthday, Peter Pan.

---

## ANN:
What? Is it my birthday again?

---

## MICHAEL:
Oh yes, time moves very fast or not at all in Neverland!

---

## ALL BUT ANN:
Are you one are you two are you three are you four?

---

## ANN:
Stop it!

---

## WENDY:
Happy birthday, Peter Pan!

---

## ANN:
Enough!

---

## ALL BUT ANN:
Are you one are you two are you three are you four—Are you seventy-four! Yes!

---

## ANN:
No!!

---

My hands look old! Oh, dear. Oh, never mind.

---

## JIM:
Ah, if it isn't Peter Pan!

---

## ANN:
In the flesh, Hook! Ticktock ticktock where's your arm, Hook?

---

## JIM:
Heard a rumor you walked here, Pan. Why didn't you fly?

---

## ANN:
You must be mistaken. I flew.

---

## JIM:
No, Peter Pan. You thought you'd never grow up. But you have.

---

You walked here. Slowly. Are you ready to face me?

---

## WENDY:
You big bully!

---

## JIM:
Time for you to walk the plank little girl.

---

## ANN:
You won't kill my sister! Everyone, it's time to kill Captain Hook.

---

Hook is death! Kill death! Make death die!

---

## JIM:
En Garde!

---

Who are you?

---

## ANN:
I am youth! I am joy!

---

## JIM:
Then fly!

---

## ANN:
I want my mother.

---

## WENDY:
Oh, Peter!

---

## ANN:
"Cowards die many times before their deaths / The valiant never taste of death but once!"

---

## JIM:
Finally!

---

## ANN:
Oh! Death will be an awfully big adventure!

---

## JIM:
"I'll never grow up, never grow up," that'll teach you, Pan.

---

## WENDY:
What are you saying, Tink? Oh!

---

She says, if you believe in Peter Pan, clap, please clap! Do you believe in Peter Pan?

---

## WENDY:
Oh, thank you, oh thank you!

---

## ANN:
Oh! Oh! I'm flying! I'm flying!

---

Hook, see me now? See me now, Hook?

---

## JOHN:
Annie, you're flying! You're really flying!

---

## ANN:
I'm not Ann—I'm Pan! Peter Pan!

---

## WENDY:
Peter! What was death like?

---

## MICHAEL:
Does consciousness persist after all?

---

## ANN:
It was flying! It was wonderful!

---

Oh, I'm light! Light as air!

---

## JIM:
Peter Pan! How the devil did you elude my grasp?

---

Peter Pan, you rascal!

---

## ANN:
Make him walk the plank!

---

## MICHAEL:
I'm fighting a pirate! I'm fighting a pirate!

---

## ANN:
Get him, Michael!

---

## WENDY:
We must show mercy!

---

## ANN:
No mercy! Throw him overboard! Slit his throat!

---

## MICHAEL:
I killed a pirate. And it was wonderful!

---

## WENDY:
You killed my brother! I want to go home!

---

## MICHAEL:
You're too old for the nursery now, Wendy. I killed a pirate!

---

## ANN:
Look at me, way up high! I'm flying.

---

The terror is gone. The sense of flight—weightless!

---

## ANN:
I can see everything! Davenport, Iowa! The lights on the Mississippi River! Oh!

---

Where's my ship? Now Wendy, think happy thoughts!

---

## WENDY:
I can't think happy thoughts—everyone's dead

---

and I'm getting old and I have arthritis and you have gout—

---

## ANN:
THINK HAPPY THOUGHTS!

---

## WENDY:
All right, all right let's see... happy thoughts...

---

## ANN:
Fairy dust!

---

## WENDY:
Oh, Peter, it's wonderful!

---

## MICHAEL:
We want to fly too.

---

## ANN:
Then get on board the Jolly Roger!

---

## JIM:
Can I come?

---

## ANN:
Are you reformed, you scurvy pirate?

---

## JIM:
Yes!

---

See, it was a fake!

---

## ANN:
Good, then! Everyone, get on board. Is everyone on? Michael, John?

---

## EVERYONE:
We're on!

---

## ANN:
All on board?

---

## EVERYONE:
Aye, aye, captain.

---

## ANN:
Then let's go! This way! Follow me! Line up. Oldest to youngest. We go in order.

---

## WENDY:
We can't line up, we're flying.

---

## ANN:
Fine, we don't go in order. Is everyone on board? Think happy thoughts.

---

## WENDY:
Can you see our house? Can you see 111? Can we get back into the nursery?

---

## ANN:
No, Wendy, it was your last night in the nursery.

---

## MICHAEL:
And Dad sold the house.

---

## WENDY:
He sold the house?

---

## JOHN:
He died. And we sold it. We all sold the house.

---

## WENDY:
Then where are we going to live? Where will we have Christmas?

---

I want to go back! I want to go back in!

---

## MICHAEL:
We could at least look through the windows!

---

## WENDY:
Oh yes yes! Let's!

---

Can we get in through the windows?

---

## JOHN:
No. The house isn't ours anymore.

---

## WENDY:
Then where will we go?

---

## JOHN:
Back to our grown-up lives, I suppose.

---

## ANN:
No, no!

---

## WENDY:
We must, Peter. I just remembered that I have a job. With people who are sad, who need me.

---

And also, my husband—my two kids—they need me too—

---

## ANN:
Don't leave, Wendy!

---

## WENDY:
I must, Peter.

---

## JIM:
I have to go cut cancer out of people's bodies. Also, I have two grandchildren who I like to hold. I need to go.

---

## JOHN:
I have my students. My kids. I need to see my wife. We want to grow old together.

---

## ANN:
No, don't leave!

---

## MICHAEL:
I have my patients, my wife, my children. Peter Pan, we can't stay.

---

## ANN:
When will I see you? Don't go, don't go! Oh Wendy!

---

## WENDY:
Spring cleaning, Peter Pan! I'll come back for spring cleaning!

---

## ANN:
Ugh. Grown-ups. Spring cleaning. I want to keep flying!

---

There's the Davenport Children's Theatre! There's the balcony! There's Mr. Smee! Bump Heeter.

---

## ANN:
My God, Mary Ellen Hurlbutt—she looks so pretty! And in the audience, Mary Fluhrer Nighswander!

---

And all the men in the lobby are wearing hats!

---

## ANN:
I think I see my father in the audience. I take a bow.

---

Thanks, Dad. Did you grow these yourself?

---

## GEORGE:
Yep. You looked great up there.

---

How 'bout my little girl flying?

---

## GEORGE:
Now let's go back to 111. There's a little party for you. Mother made Chex party mix.

---

You can change out of those green tights and come home.

---

## ANN:
I can go home?

---

## GEORGE:
Whaddya mean, of course you can.

---

It's your last Christmas before you go out east to college.

---

## GEORGE:
We're all going to miss you. But it's going to be an awfully big adventure.

---

## ANN:
Do you think so?

---

## GEORGE:
I know so.

---

## ANN:
I'm suddenly afraid. Did you die? What was it like?

---

Your breathing was terrible. It seemed like you didn't want to go. Was it awful?

---

## GEORGE:
Come on now, change your costume.

---

## ANN:
I don't want to change costumes.

---

## GEORGE:
Those green tights can't be too comfortable after a while. Mother's waiting at home.

---

## ANN:
Will you come with me?

---

## GEORGE:
They don't want a father in the dressing room.

---

## ANN:
No, I mean will you come with me?

---

## GEORGE:
Course I will. I've been here all along.

---

## ANN:
Oh, good! Will you hold my flowers while I change?

---

And my photograph with Mary Martin? It's my good luck charm.

---

## GEORGE:
I'm very proud of you, Annie.

---

## ANN:
Thanks, Dad.

---

## GEORGE:
All right.

**EPILOGUE**

---

## ANN:
And I went up to my dressing room while he waited. I took off my green tights.

---

But before I went home, I stayed in the theater for a little while longer.

---

## ANN:
Where you don't have to grow up.
