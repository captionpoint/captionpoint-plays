---
---

[Sounds of commotion and people yelling]

---

[Water splashing]

---

## GEORGE:
Please forgive my apprehension. It’s simply that.... I’ve never done this for a group of four all at once. Usually it’s a housewife, or a sole proprietor --

--

## LOTTIE:
By all means. Take your time. Ain’t like it’s hot in here or nothing.

---

## JOHN:
Lottie, don’t be rude. Go on ahead, Mr. Oakley.

---

## GEORGE:
This is an age -- oh no, may I start over?

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
Go ahead. We have nowhere else to go. It is Sunday, after all.

---

## DAISY:
That’s right. It’s Sunday. The day of rest.

---

## LOTTIE:
I need some rest. I’m sleepy.

---

## GEORGE:
I promise. This will wake you right out of your slumber. I’ll start again.

---

## GEORGE:
(begins coughing)

---

## DAISY:
Mr. Oakley. Do you need some water? A lozenge? Perhaps some warm tea?

---

## LOTTIE:
Why would this man want some warm tea when it’s this hot out?

---

## JOHN:
Yeah, don’t draw this out, Daisy.

---

## GEORGE:
(stops coughing)Thank you for the generous offer, but I believe I’ll manage.

---

## GEORGE:
This is the age of progress. We are now able to cross the Atlantic in a matter of days.

---

## LOTTIE:
Are you talking about the Titanic? That boat didn’t cross the Atlantic. It sank.

---

## GEORGE:
Well, that was an anomaly. Ocean liners of that size typically don’t sink.

---

## JOHN:
The Lusitania did.

---

## GEORGE:
That wasn’t an accident, sir.

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
I think the Britannic sank, too, didn’t it? Was that one an accident?

---

## GEORGE:
I believe that was also not an accident.

---

## LOTTIE:
So seems like it ain’t no sense in you talking about these boats. You’re a salesman, right?

---

## LOTTIE:
Right now, you ain’t selling me nothing but tragedy. You’re bringing my spirit down.

---

## GEORGE:
I’ll take a different tack. This century. The twentieth century... is a century of innovation.

---

## GEORGE:
We have dirigibles. Flying airships that can --

--

(loud clearing of another throat from
off stage.)

---

## GEORGE: 
Oh, yes. Right. Virginia said not to mention dirigibles because of that awful accident downtown on Monday that killed all those poor bank tellers...

---

## LOTTIE:
If he don’t hurry up, I swear I’m gonna kill myself.

---

## GEORGE:
Everywhere we turn, modern technology is not only taking to the sea and sky, but has come right here. Into this very parlor. 

---

## GEORGE: 
The household jobs that used to take hours now take mere minutes, allowing the modern Chicagoan more time to spend cavorting with friends at White City or cheering on the Sox at Comiskey Park--

---

## JOHN:
We don’t go there. We go to South Side Park. To see the Giants. You know about the American Giants, right?

---

## DAISY:
For heaven’s sake, Daddy! The man can’t get a single sentence out!

---

## JOHN:
Daisy, I’m just trying to explain.

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
You’ll have to pardon us, Mr. Oakley. It’s the heat. Everyone’s a tad bit whacked.

---

## GEORGE:
It’s understandable, Reverend Maxwell. I’ll skip to the end, then. 

---

## GEORGE:
(Yelling) On behalf of the Edgerton Home Products Company, we proudly present D-Lux Model Number Seven,fresh off the lines!

---

[Loud roar of a vacuume offstage]

(Daisy begins screaming)

---

## JOHN:
What the hell?!?

---

## LOTTIE:
Oh, Jesus, what is that?

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
That ain’t no kind of right.

---

## LOTTIE:
That’s supposed to be a carpet sweeper? Ginny, you should have said something!!

---

## VIRGINIA:
I told you! I told all of you!! Isn’t it nice??

---

## LOTTIE:
John, why didn’t you tell me? You know I got this bad heart!

---

## DAISY:
Why is it so loud?

---

## GEORGE:
It pulls air into the machine so that the dust can --

---

## DAISY:
It takes the air out of the room?!?

---

## VIRGINIA:
Its only purpose is to clean the carpet!

---

## JOHN:
Yeah, but Ginny, you never said it would be electric!

---

## GEORGE:
Electricity is the essential selling point, Mr. Bass!

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
Should we pray?

---

## JOHN:
Virginia, you’re gonna make all the lights go out!

---

## VIRGINIA:
Pop, quit your grousing! Look how easily it glides over the floor!

---

## JOHN:
What??

---

## VIRGINIA:
I said, look how easily -- Daisy, SHUT UP!!

---

## LOTTIE:
Control that thing! It has a mind of its own!

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
Let’s bow our heads.

---

## VIRGINIA:
It’s just a machine!

---

## GEORGE:
Yes, that’s all it is, just a machine!

---

## VIRGINIA:
Here, I’ll shut it off.

---

## VIRGINIA:
George, can you help me? I can’t seem to turn it off.

---

## DAISY:
Oh, Lord. Oh, Jesus. She can’t turn it off!

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
Father God, we come to you, in the name of your one and only son, Jesus Christ--

---

## DAISY:
It’s too late for prayer.

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
Prayer always works --

---

## VIRGINIA:
Daisy, what are you doing?!?

---

(Daisy still screaming)
[Sound of metal clinking as Daisy beats the vacuum]

---

[The vacuum sputters to a stop]
(Daisy stops screaming and is panting heavily)

---

## GEORGE:
Virginia did mention that this would be your first time seeing the new model.

---

## DAISY:
I’m sorry, Mr. Oakley. I just... don’t know why anyone would make such a contraption.

---

## JOHN:
It’s alright, Daisy. Just put down the poker.

---

## JOHN:
Now let me ask you something, Mr. Oakley. This thing is supposed to clean the floor?

---

## GEORGE:
Please, call me George. And yes, it works by suction. Centrifugal forces spin the dust at high speeds and deposit it into a receptacle.

---

## LOTTIE:
And then what?

---

## GEORGE:
And... and then your floor is clean?

---

## VIRGINIA:
Aunt Lottie, all the dust and dirt go into this part here, and then you can just throw it all out in the backyard, where it belongs!

---

## DAISY:
I think I’d rather just scrub the rug myself.

---

## GEORGE:
I should have mentioned that this version of Model Number Seven is... a prototype.

---

## GEORGE:
Edgerton Home Products has only recently begun branching out into consumer electronics. We’re experimenting with ways to reduce the noise that this model generates.

---

## VIRGINIA:
That’s right, George. Actually, the company only made ten of this model for the sales team to use in home demonstrations.

---

## VIRGINIA:
Now I suppose we only have nine.

---

## JOHN:
Don’t have a heart attack. I can reimburse you for the cost of the cleaner.

---

## VIRGINIA:
You can always take it out of Daisy’s allowance.

---

## DAISY:
I don’t get no allowance. I earn every nickel I spend.

---

## LOTTIE:
Put both your tongues back in your mouths! What’s wrong with you?

---

## JOHN:
Leave your sister alone, Ginny.

---

## GEORGE:
Don’t worry about reimbursing us, Mr. Bass. I’m sure it can easily be repaired. In fact,that’s one of the top priorities for our engineers. Ease of use.

---

## GEORGE:
We have detailed manuals showing you exactly how all the parts work so that even a common housewife can repair or replace them herself. 

---

## GEORGE:
And we believe that our model has the most efficient electricity use of all the models currently on the market, including the one sold by Mr. Hoover.

---

[lights fizzle]

---

## DAISY:
Oh no!

---

## LOTTIE:
Did the vacuum do that?

---

## JOHN:
Of course it did. What did I tell you?

---

## LOTTIE:
What are we supposed to do now? I can’t hardly see.

---

## VIRGINIA:
I’ll handle it

---

## LOTTIE:
Just do that one window, Ginny. It’s hot.

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
No matter what we do today, we all gonna roast.

---

## JOHN:
The real heat was all in that church today.

---

## JOHN:
Eugene, the sermon you gave this morning filled us with the Holy Ghost.

---

## LOTTIE:
Sure had me shouting.

---

## JOHN:
This boy has the fire of the prophets in him.
It’s a sin and a shame you missed it, Ginny.

---

## VIRGINIA:
I told you, Pop. The train was late.

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
I don’t know if it was one of my best sermons. I think most of the prophets would have been disappointed. Especially Isaiah.

---

## JOHN:
You’re too hard on yourself.
Ginny. You know he’s being installed next week.

---

## VIRGINIA:
Eugene! You never told me. You’re going to be permanent pastor?

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
Guess they couldn’t find anybody else foolish enough to take on the task.

---

## LOTTIE:
Boy, hush. You know you got a calling on your life

---

## JOHN:
And he sure did answer, didn’t he? When you ever heard of a pastor this young?

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
You forget I preached my first sermon when I was eleven years old.

---

## VIRGINIA:
This is wonderful, Eugene. Congratulations. I know how badly you wanted that. It was pretty much all you ever wanted.

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
Pretty much.

---

## DAISY:
Mr. Oakley, may I ask you something?

---

## GEORGE:
Certainly.

---

## DAISY:
Do you just bring these monstrosities up and down the railways, unloading them on unsuspecting people like us?

---

## VIRGINIA:
Daisy! What a rude question. After you’ve destroyed-

--

## GEORGE:
It’s all right, Virginia.

---

## LOTTIE:
I was thinking the same thing. I just wasn’t rude enough to ask it. But since she asked, Mr. Oakley, do you in fact lug these things all over the country?

---

## GEORGE:
In point of fact, sales have expanded all across the country. The streamlining of the assembly process for D-Lux Model Number Seven has allowed us to decrease the purchase price considerably. 

---

## GEORGE:
You can think of Virginia and me, or of our business, as like a mail-order catalog. Only a little livelier.

---

## JOHN:
And how much would one of these things sell for?

---

## GEORGE:
Model Number Seven is currently priced at forty dollars.

---

## JOHN:
Forty dollars??

---

## LOTTIE:
For forty dollars, I’d just buy a new rug every week. For forty dollars, I’d hire a maid. I’d hire two or three. 

---

## LOTTIE:
For Forty Dollars, Hell, I would buy an electric fan for every room in my house --

--

## VIRGINIA:
We understand that price may seem... exorbitant to some. But this is an item you will have for the rest of your life.

---

## GEORGE:
Indeed. We even provide a warranty to all our customers in case the worst happens.

---

## DAISY:
What’s the worst?

---

## VIRGINIA:
A catastrophic event that renders the machine unsalvageable. Sort of like the beating you were giving it earlier.

---

## DAISY:
I really am sorry, Ginny. Don’t be cross with me please.

---

## VIRGINIA:
I guess I should have... anticipated your reaction. You can be a bit skittish.

---

## JOHN:
She was only trying to protect us, Virginia.
Now back to this... warranty, Mr. Oakley.

---

## GEORGE:
Please, sir. Call me George

---

## JOHN:
Alright, then... George. Say you sold me this machine, and it breaks down, and I can’t use it anymore. Or I can’t order the parts I need.

---

## JOHN:
Or I can’t understand the pictures in the manual. Where do I go? Who do I talk to?

---

## GEORGE:
Oh, that’s easy. You would simply contact company headquarters.

---

## JOHN:
And when the operator connects me, would I ask to speak to you? You’d probably be on the road, right? And how long would it take for a replacement to arrive?

---

## GEORGE:
That depends on your location. Company headquarters is in Massachusetts, but we are opening about two satellite offices every year. In fact, we’re discussing expansion to
Omaha.

---

## JOHN:
Omaha? Is that right? That’s only, what, a couple of days by train from here?

---

## VIRGINIA:
Pop, you know people have been ordering products by mail for decades.

---

## JOHN:
But they’ve been buying products from places they could walk to since forever. From people they know. People they trust. Only strangers need warranties.

---

## LOTTIE:
In case he ain’t made it obvious, Mr. Oakley, John is a businessman himself. He owns a dry goods store down the street.

---

## DAISY:
I work there too.
And not for an allowance.

---

## GEORGE:
Your father’s a salesman, too? You never told me. That must be why you have such a knack for it.

---

## JOHN:
You didn’t tell him that, Ginny?

---

## VIRGINIA
It never came up in conversation.

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
That seems hard to believe.

---

## GEORGE:
So I’m in the company of a fellow salesman, eh? How many locations do you have?

---

## VIRGINIA:
It’s just the one.

---

## DAISY:
But everyone in the neighborhood knows where it is. They come from far and wide because they know we have the best merchandise.

---

## GEORGE:
Is that so? Well, independent retailers are our bread and butter. Mr. Bass, would you ever be interested in selling consumer electronics?

---

## JOHN:
I can’t be sure, Mr. Oakley. Most of us around here are just bumpkins. It’s a miracle I even have running water and a telephone.

---

## VIRGINIA:
You know that’s not what he meant by that, Pop.


---

## LOTTIE:
John, why are you asking all these sales questions anyway? You should be asking how Ginny and Mr. Oakley just walk up into people’s houses together.

---

## LOTTIE:
So Ginny. How does all this work? Y’all both just walk in the front door? Together?

---

## GEORGE:
I’ll answer that. We do walk into our sales calls together. In most places.

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
What about the other places?

---

## VIRGINIA:
We try to avoid areas where our appearing together would be... a problem.

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
And that’s alright by you?

---

## LOTTIE:
John, I’m going to see if I can get these lights back on. Daisy, come with me in case I electrocute myself.

---

## DAISY:
But I don’t want to go to the fusebox --

--

## LOTTIE:
Daisy. I didn’t ask you nothing. Besides, you want me to die out there?

---

## JOHN:
You saying that nobody bat an eye at unmarried companions? I know y’all ain’t trying to pass as man and wife.

---

## GEORGE:
Of course not. I think that might arouse suspicions. To say nothing of seeming less than professional.

---

## VIRGINIA:
We travel separately.

---

## GEORGE:
Indeed. Separate train cars, separate tickets, separate everything. No fuss that way.

---

## JOHN:
How modern. Anyhow, Mr Oak -- George. That vacuum cleaner doesn’t look beyond repair to me. Matter of fact, I think I have some tools that’ll fix it right up. If you’ll accompany me this way.

---

## GEORGE:
Much obliged, Mr. Bass.

---

[Silence]

---

## VIRGINIA:
Is this... new?

---

## VIRGINIA:
Oh, praise God.

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
Praise God and your Aunt Lottie.

---

## VIRGINIA:
Indeed.

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
Maybe we can get that fan hooked up. It’s Hades in here.

---

## VIRGINIA:
I’m sweltering myself. I think I might be getting a headache.

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
You’re still getting those? The headaches?

---

## VIRGINIA:
Not so frequently as before. In fact, the last time I had one this badly was-

--

## REV. MAXWELL:
The last time you were home?

---

## VIRGINIA:
I only meant that it’s stifling.
We need music, don’t you suppose?

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
If you insist.

---

## VIRGINIA:
Good. Music then

---

[Silence]

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
Can I help?

---

## VIRGINIA:
Do you know how to work one of these?

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
I can’t say I do, but I can try. 

---

## VIRGINIA:
Mother was a whiz with these. I swear, she could take one apart and reassemble it blindfolded. Then again, this machine was her saving grace. 

---

## VIRGINIA:
Got her through those terrible last few years.

---

## VIRGINIA:
I see the problem. This needle’s been worn to the nub.
Pop! We’re out of needles!

---

## VIRGINIA:
Eugene. Do you know where Pop keeps the needles? I don’t see any loud-tone ones.

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
How would I know?

---

## VIRGINIA:
Well you've been in this house before, so I figured that.

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
Daisy seems quite enamored of Mr. Oakley, and very penitent about wrecking his vacuum.

---

## VIRGINIA:
She should be.

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
I think she has a crush on him.

---

## VIRGINIA:
She’s fifteen.

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
As I recall, that’s not too young.

---

## VIRGINIA:
I suppose not.

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
I was expecting to see you in church today.

---

## VIRGINIA:
The train was late. Everyone says you were wonderful, though. The fire of the prophets and all that.

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
I can’t help it when the Spirit moves me.

---

## VIRGINIA:
I should honestly start thinking about supper. Will you turn up?

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
In all likelihood.

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
But, I’m not quite sure yet. We’ve called a meeting of the deacon board and I don’t know how long it will last.

---

## VIRGINIA:
Oh. I suppose that is important business.

---

## VIRGINIA:
I’s just that, I saw some butter beans in the pantry. With that and the ham, that should do it, no?

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
Yes, that oughta suit everyone just fine.

---

## VIRGINIA:
I’ve been meaning to ask. How’s Agnes? I do hope I have enough time to pay her a visit.

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
Agnes? 

---

## VIRGINIA:
Yes. The church organist? Most Sundays she was the only thing to look forward to.

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
I thought you knew.

---

## VIRGINIA:
Knew what?

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
The influenza took her. Last November.

---

## VIRGINIA:
What?

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
I wrote to you. Didn’t you --

--

## VIRGINIA:
No.

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
Weren’t you still in St. Louis then?

---

## VIRGINIA:
No. By November we’d moved on to Wichita

---

## VIRGINIA:
I tried to come for Christmas.

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
You tried.

---

## VIRGINIA:
I don’t believe that’s fair, Eugene. I never made you any promises -

--

## REV. MAXWELL:
Didn’t you? Didn’t you promise??

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
I used to envy you, Ginny. How you could just strike out to wherever, without a care. But I don’t envy you anymore because I see you for what you are. You are selfish.

---

## VIRGINIA:
I’m selfish?!? I hope it gives you satisfaction to say such terrible -

--

[A gunshot rings out, along with a scream and the sounds of broken glass]

---

## JOHN:
Are y’all alright?

---

## VIRGINIA:
What on earth...?

---

## JOHN:
Draw the shade

---

[Sounds of mayhem outside begin]
[Clock chimes and eerie pianno music plays]

---

## LOTTIE:
Last I heard, they hung five Negro boys right there on the beach. Just strung ‘em up while the police did nothing.

---

## JOHN:
Where you hear that from?

---

## LOTTIE:
Everywhere. Everybody knows. It’s a damn shame. Excuse me, Pastor.

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
No need to apologize. I’m not a pastor for another week.

---

## LOTTIE:
It’s a shame that these boys -- our boys, boys from our block -- could be minding their business out on the lake 

---

## LOTTIE:
and just because their raft drift past 28th Street, that make it okay for white boys to throw rocks at ‘em until they hit that poor boy in the head and he drowns?

---

## GEORGE:
How dreadful.

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
What do you think will happen now?

---

## JOHN
Revenge about to happen now.

---

## LOTTIE:
My only surprise is that it took so long for something like this to happen. I’ve been carrying a knife to and from work every day for a month now.

---

## JOHN:
You’ve been doing what?

---

## LOTTIE:
I don’t have no choice. How else am I supposed to ride the streetcar by myself?

---

## JOHN:
Well, I don’t like that.

---

## LOTTIE:
You think I like it?

---

## GEORGE:
I’ll just say, Ms. Bass, if I were your brother, I’d be worried about you too.

---

## LOTTIE:
It’s Mrs. Dickerson. John here is my brother-in-law, not my brother. Although, given how much he and I fuss and fight, I understand your confusion.

---

## JOHN:
She’s right, George. We don’t always act this way, though.

---

(REV. MAXWELL lets out a chuckle, which he
immediately tries to cover with a cough.)

---

## JOHN:
You alright, Eugene?

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
Yes, sir. I might have caught a stray peppercorn.

---

## LOTTIE:
Speaking of... my butter beans are getting cold.
Ginny! Daisy! Hurry up with that ham!

---

## VIRGINIA (offstage):
We’re cutting it up right now!

---

## DAISY (offstage)
Yes! We’re trying our best! Please be patient!

---

## LOTTIE:
I tried to teach your daughters how to cook. As quiet as it’s kept, my sister was never that good a cook either.

---

## JOHN:
Even ten years later, it’s not right to speak ill of the dead.

---

## LOTTIE:
She was my sister. And speaking the truth ain’t never ill. She couldn’t cook and neither can they.

---

## JOHN:
Maybe they all had a bad teacher.

---

## LOTTIE:
I guess I never considered that possibility, John.

---

## GEORGE:
That looks wonderful.

---

## DAISY:
We worked real hard.

---

## VIRGINIA:
Really hard, Daisy. Really hard.

---

## JOHN:
Everybody sit. Eugene, will you bless the food?

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
Of course, Mr. Bass. May we bow?

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
Lord, we need your grace, your peace, and your protection now more than ever. Bless the hands that prepared this food, and may it nourish and strengthen our bodies as your love and mercy nourish our souls. In your Son’s matchless name, Amen.

---

## EVERYONE BUT GEORGE:
Amen.

---

## GEORGE:
Amen.

---

## VIRGINIA:
That was very eloquent, Eugene.

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
I do alright.

---

[Silence]

---

## LOTTIE:
This ain’t no ham.

---

## GEORGE:
It’s not?

---

## VIRGINIA:
Aunt Lottie, what do you mean?

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
It looks like ham to me.

---

## DAISY:
I already ate some!

---

## JOHN:
Of course it’s ham. Lottie, stop this foolishness.

---

## LOTTIE:
You know how many hams I done seen and ate? I know ham when I see it. And that. Ain’t no ham.

---

## JOHN:
Then what is it?

---

## LOTTIE:
I can’t tell you what it IS. I just know what it ain’t.

---

## VIRGINIA:
George. Everyone. Please be assured that this is ham.

---

## JOHN:
I swear, Lottie, you always get nervous about every little thing and then you get everybody else nervous too. THIS. IS. HAM.

---

## LOTTIE:
Well, if you shouting it like that, sound like you ain’t so sure yourself.

---

## JOHN:
Look at Daisy. You got her choking and spitting in her napkin.

---

## LOTTIE:
Good thinking, Daisy. Keep spitting that out. Whatever it is.

---

## GEORGE:
I have doubts now as well. This is, in fact, ham, yes?

---

## JOHN:
See what you started?

---

## LOTTIE:
We live a handful of blocks from them stock yards. We smell pork all day long. Why don’t I smell it now when it’s supposed to be right in front of me?

---

## GEORGE:
Is that what I’ve been smelling all day?

---

## VIRGINIA:
I told you, George. The stock yards are close.

---

## GEORGE:
I’ve read Upton Sinclair. That line of work sounds like a hellhole.

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
I don’t agree. It’s one of the only places where a Negro man can find union work.

---

## JOHN:
They can find it. But they don’t join. And I don’t blame them. I don’t see the purpose for a labor union.

---

## VIRGINIA:
Even if this... isn’t ham, must we also debate --

--

## LOTTIE:
Y’all ain’t gotta humor me. Eat it if you want to.

---

[Silence]

---

## GEORGE:
You know something, Mr. Bass? I agree with you. About labor unions.

---

## VIRGINIA:
Is that so?

---

## GEORGE:
I believe all unions ultimately devolve into ethnic conflicts that help no one.

---

## JOHN:
That’s a soft way to put it, George, but I take your point.

---

## GEORGE:
Thank you, sir. I simply believe, as you do, that unions don’t serve the interests of all their members in an equal fashion.

---

## VIRGINIA:
Are you making an argument for doing away with unions entirely?

---

## JOHN:
Virginia. Let the man speak. It’s the first time he’s made sense all day.

---

## JOHN:
Just teasing, George. So I take it that your company is not unionized?

---

## GEORGE:
Oh no. We are insistent on freedom.

---

## LOTTIE:
Freedom for who?

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
That’s precisely what I was thinking.

---

## VIRGINIA:
I can’t imagine a labor union that would have me as a member unless I were doing something like hemming shirtwaists.

---

## JOHN:
What’s wrong with that? It’s work, isn’t it?


---

## VIRGINIA:
I only meant that fulfilling work is hard to come by. And my current employment arrangement affords me the opportunity to... make my own rules.

---

## GEORGE:
That’s it, exactly! For example... Virginia, tell them the story about the woman who answered the door in Louisville. When we were still selling the non-electric sweeper.

---

## DAISY:
You went to Louisville? I wish I could go there.

---

## VIRGINIA:
It is... a bustling city.

---

## GEORGE:
But tell them about that sale you made.

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
It looks like she don’t want to.

---

## JOHN:
I want to hear. Especially if my daughter closed a big sale.

---

## VIRGINIA:
I don’t know how thrilling the story is, but... We paid a call to this big house in Louisville. Had it on good authority that the lady of the house would be there.

---

## VIRGINIA:
But when we arrived, she was apparently out at a tea given by her ladies’ club. 

---

## VIRGINIA:
The maid, however,was there. In fact, she answered the door. So George and I... made the most of it, and we shared a catalog for our home appliances with the maid to give to her employer when she returned.

---

## GEORGE:
Oh, Virginia, you’re being far too modest

---

## GEORGE:
Virginia did the most brilliant thing. She connected with the maid by telling her how much easier her life was after her employer bought a carpet sweeper. And you should have seen the look on the maid’s face after that.

---

## GEORGE:
Not only did the maid share the catalog with everyone in the household, the next day the master and the mistress of the house called on our hotel

---

## GEORGE:
and we got a week’s worth of commitments from them in the space of an hour! All thanks to Virginia!

---

## VIRGINIA:
I don’t know how much credit I deserve. I learned from you, George, that everyone is a potential customer, no  matter his or her... station in life.

---

## JOHN:
These white folks -- the master and mistress, as you say -
-- when did y’all tell them you weren’t really a maid?

---

## VIRGINIA:
We decided not to do or say anything that would compromise the sale.

---

## DAISY:
Makes plenty of sense to me. They probably tell y’all to play pretend all the time, huh?

---

## JOHN:
DAISY!

---

## JOHN:
There’s pretend and then there’s flat-out lying. George, didn’t you say sales was all about building solid relationships? Gaining trust?

---

## VIRGINIA:
No need to get on his case. I went along with it. In fact, it was my idea.

---

## JOHN:
That’s even worse.

---

## LOTTIE:
John, leave her alone. She has to make a living, doesn’t she?

---

## VIRGINIA:
It’s alright, Aunt Lottie. Like you said earlier, Pop, I take your point. About the dignity of work.

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
For what it’s worth, Ginny, I don’t see anything wrong with it. You must be quite proud of yourself.

---

## VIRGINIA:
I was.

---

[Silence]

---

## DAISY:
At least it’s quieter now. Out there.

---

[Gunshot]

---

## JOHN:
Not quiet anymore. Sun’s going down.

---

## VIRGINIA:
The quiet scares me more than the noise.

---

## LOTTIE:
That's not noise, Ginny. That’s death.

---

## JOHN:
Well. Death is gonna have to pass this house and go next door.

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
Where’s Mr. Bass going?

---

## LOTTIE:
Probably to go get Alma.

---

## GEORGE:
Who’s Alma?

---

## DAISY:
You’ll see.

---

## LOTTIE:
That’s Alma.

---

## GEORGE:
Your gun has a name?

---

## JOHN:
Why not? It’s just as much a member of the family as anybody else here.

---

## GEORGE
I don’t own any firearms. I’ve never had to.

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
Not even for your protection? Or Virginia’s?

---

## VIRGINIA:
I don’t imagine keeping guns on us would make customers comfortable.

---

## GEORGE:
Quite right, Virginia.

---

## VIRGINIA:
But hey. Maybe we could put in for a transfer out West. We could be a regular Buffalo Bill and Annie Oakley.

---

## GEORGE:
I can’t picture you shooting the ashes off a cigarette-

---

## JOHN:
I hate to interrupt this, but we should watch the house. Take turns sitting up in case somebody tries something. 

---

## JOHN:
George, Eugene. The three of us will rotate the watch. Let’s keep the lights down low and not get too excited.

---

## DAISY:
So we want to make it seem like nobody lives here?

---

## JOHN:
Yes, Daisy. That’s a good way to put it.

---

## VIRGINIA:
Won’t that make us even more of a target? This is a nice house. If people think it’s empty,they’ll burst in here without a second thought.

---

## JOHN:
In any case, Ginny, take Daisy and Lottie upstairs with you.

---

## LOTTIE:
I’m not staying here tonight. Charles is expecting me --

--

## JOHN:
I’ll call Chuckie. Trust me, I know how to deal with your husband.

---

## LOTTIE:
I can take care of myself, John. Especially if it’s only a few blocks --

--

## JOHN:
This ain’t up for discussion. We’re taking precautions. That’s the sensible thing to do.

---

## LOTTIE:
So we’re just supposed to sleep here overnight?
All of us?

---

## VIRGINIA:
George and I aren’t staying here. We have a hotel reservation.

---

## DAISY:
How will you get there if the streets are so dangerous?

---

## VIRGINIA:
We'll be just fine. We’ve been all over the country this summer.

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
I think we should all listen to Mr. Bass. It’s safer if we’re all together.

---

## JOHN:
Thank you, Eugene. If it’s as bad as it sounds, we all just need to hunker down. And I’m not going to hear another word about it. I’m going to find that plywood.

---

## JOHN:
Lottie, Daisy,Ginny, get upstairs and get the bedrooms together. Eugene and... George... take the curtains down and get ready to help me board up the windows.

---

## VIRGINIA:
You’re boarding up the windows?

---

## JOHN:
Virginia. Go upstairs.

---

## VIRGINIA:
Well. Aunt Lottie. Daisy. You heard the man.

---

[Silence]

---

## GEORGE:
Well. I suppose we should get to work?

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
Yes. Let’s... get to work.

---

## GEORGE:
You have to untie these, no?

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
Yes.

---

## GEORGE:
Do you really believe there’s going to be more violence? Or is Mr. Bass being hyperbolic?

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
Hard to say. Always better to take precautions, you know?

---

## GEORGE:
It’s just that... Virginia doesn’t seem too concerned.

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
Virginia sometimes doesn’t know what’s good for her.

---

## GEORGE:
How’s that?

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
All I mean is... she can’t tell the difference sometimes between protection and control.

---

## GEORGE:
You underestimate her.

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
Do I?

---

## GEORGE:
All I mean by that is... can’t she make up her own mind about things?

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
Everyone makes bad decisions. From time to time.

---

## GEORGE:
Sounds like that should be a Bible verse.

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
It is. From Romans. But I’m paraphrasing. For the uninitiated.

---

## GEORGE:
Ah.

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
Do you need help untying those? Seems like you’re having trouble with the knots

---

## GEORGE:
Have you ever seen Virginia in the classroom?

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
What?

---

## GEORGE:
It’s a wonder to watch her teach. It’s a noble profession.

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
Then why did you take her out of it? Is it more “noble” to pretend to be a maid just to sell a carpet sweeper?

---

## GEORGE:
I didn’t mean that. I meant... Teachers make the best salesmen. A salesman has to teach the customer to love something they just found out existed thirty seconds prior. That takes skill. 

---

## GEORGE:
It feels like yesterday when I met Virginia, when she had just finished up at the teachers’school. The teachers’school is down in Normal --

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
I know where the teachers’ college is. Ginny was supposed to come back afterward, but she stayed down there to help open up the new high school.

---

## GEORGE:
She was restless though. When I came to the rooming house where she stayed, on a sales call, I could tell she had a hunger for something more. 

---

## GEORGE:
She just had -- has -- this... effervescence about her, you know? So I gave her an opportunity.

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
You... gave it to her? Out of the kindness of your heart?

---

## GEORGE:
I’d say she’s done alright for herself. At least now she’s not on her way to being a spinster or anything like that.

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
That’s probably not a thing you wanna say to me right before I go find a hammer.

---

[piano music with a marching beat, like clock tick-tocking plays]

---

[Clock ticking]

---

## LOTTIE:
Jesus!

---

## DAISY:
Sorry...

---

## LOTTIE:
Daisy, what are you still doing up?

---

## DAISY:
Every time I doze off, I just hear windows breaking all over again. What are you doing up? I thought Daddy was watching the house.

---

## LOTTIE:
I told him to go upstairs and get some sleep before he went plum out of his mind.Besides, I know my way around Alma just as good as he does.

---

## LOTTIE:
You shouldn’t be walking around. Now go back upstairs.

---

## DAISY:
I don’t want to. Can’t I stay down here with you?

---

## LOTTIE:
Alright, I guess. But you need to come set down and be still. You’re making me nervous.

---

## DAISY:
Is it gonna be like this all night? Quiet? Waiting for something bad to happen, somebody to come busting in the house, looking to hurt us, or worse yet--

--

## LOTTIE:
It won’t.

---

## DAISY:
How do you know?

---

## LOTTIE:
Because I just prayed on it. Now hush up that kinda talk.

---

[Silence]

---

## LOTTIE:
Well? Why you so quiet?

---

## DAISY:
You said hush up.

---

## LOTTIE:
I said hush up that kinda talk. I didn’t say hush all the way up. Tell a joke.

---

## DAISY:
I don’t think I know any.

---

## LOTTIE:
You don’t know one joke?

---

## DAISY:
I guess I remember one I heard in Sunday school today.

---

## LOTTIE:
I’m all ears.

---

## DAISY:
So there was this woman who was married to a soldier who had to go off to the war. But before he go off, she find out she carrying his baby.

---

## DAISY:
Twins, in fact. But her husband still have to ship off to battle, so he leaves her in the care of his sister. Only problem is, his sister is a little soft in the head. Missing some of her marbles. 

---

## DAISY:
So while the soldier husband is away, time come for his wife to have the babies. Well, during the birthing, it’s just too much for her, and she pass out. 

---

## DAISY:
When she wakes up, the doctor tells her she got two brand new healthy babies. A boy and a girl. And she’s so overjoyed, she says, “Praise Jesus! Bring ‘em to me so I can see ‘em and give ‘em names.”

---

## DAISY:
And the doctor says, “Oh, no need for that. The babies’ auntie done named them already.” And the mama gets scared, because she knows the auntie ain’t too bright.

---

## DAISY:
So she asks what the girl’s name is, and the doctor says, “Denise.” And the mama is so relieved, ‘cause Denise is such a pretty name. Maybe this woman ain’t too plum dumb after all.

---

## DAISY:
Then she asks what the boy’s name is. And the doctor says, “His name is...De-Nephew.”

---

## LOTTIE:
I changed my mind, Daisy. Just set there and don’t talk.


---

## VIRGINIA:
Aunt Lottie, is it wise to keep these lights burning?

---

## LOTTIE:
Is that Whikey?

---

## VIRGINIA:
It ain't iced tea.

---

## DAISY:
Daddy don’t like nobody drinking in his house on the Lord’s Day.

---

## LOTTIE:
Don’t get in a twist, Daisy. Whiskey is grown folks’ business. Stay out of grown folks’ business.

---

## DAISY:
Oooh. I’mma tell.

---

## LOTTIE:
Go ahead and see what happens. 

---

## VIRGINIA:
I should never have talked George into coming here.

---

## LOTTIE:
Why? You feel bad for him?

---

## DAISY:
Oooh. You love him. Can’t say I blame you.

---

## VIRGINIA:
I do not love him, Daisy. Our relationship is limited to business.

---

## LOTTIE:
And that’s dangerous enough as it is.

---

## DAISY:
Are you going to marry him?

---

## VIRGINIA:
No!

---

## DAISY:
Good. Because Daddy would beat you into next week at the suggestion.

---

## VIRGINIA:
I’m twenty-four years old.

---

## DAISY:
That ain’t too big to beat.

---

## VIRGINIA:
You don’t have to do everything he says. But he likes to convince you that you do. Trust me --

---

## LOTTIE:
Ginny, the problem is out there. And you adding to it mixing with white folk like George. You oil and he water.

---

## VIRGINIA:
I heard you the first time.

---

[A fire engine roars by, its horn deafening]


---

## VIRGINIA:
He isn’t embarrassed, is he? Pop? To have George here?

---

## LOTTIE:
You gotta ask him that. But you know as well as I do that John is a proud man.

---

## VIRGINIA:
Oh, I know he’s proud. I just wish he were proud of me.

---

## LOTTIE:
Okay, well, if you’re gonna be talking like that, I at least deserve a drink.

---

## JOHN:
Y’all shouldn’t be in here.

---

## LOTTIE:
Neither should you. Didn’t I send you upstairs to rest?

---

## JOHN:
I couldn’t sleep.

---

## DAISY:
Me neither, Daddy.

---

## JOHN:
Only the menfolk should be keeping watch.

---

## VIRGINIA:
Aunt Lottie is scarier than all you “menfolk” put together.

---

## LOTTIE:
It’s true. All I gotta do is give my crazy look and people leave me alone. I’ve seen people just run across the street at the sight of me.

---

## LOTTIE:
You know it’s serious if they would rather take their chances getting hit by a streetcar than deal with me.

---

## JOHN:
I’m not sure that’s your “crazy look” so much as it is you just being crazy.

---

## LOTTIE:
Could be both.

---

## DAISY:
I told them you don’t like drinking on Sundays.

---

## JOHN:
I ain’t drinking tonight. But y’all can have the whole bottle for all I care

---

## LOTTIE:
Well, this is a new and improved John.

---

## JOHN:
I just... don’t want to see y’all getting too nervous. Whiskey might calm y’all down.

---

## VIRGINIA:
What about you? You don’t want any?

---

## JOHN:
No, I better not. In case something happens. And we really oughta put out one of these lights.

---

## LOTTIE:
We won’t hardly be able to see.

---

## JOHN:
I know what y’all look like. And we don’t wanna draw attention.

---

## VIRGINIA:
Pop, why don’t you sit down? You sure you don’t want just a nip of whiskey? To calm you down?

---

## LOTTIE:
I got an idea. Why don’t we play some cards?

---

## JOHN:
Lottie, I don’t know if I can concentrate on no cards.

---

## LOTTIE:
It’ll keep us from going out of our heads.

---

## DAISY:
Ooh! Can we play bid?

---

## LOTTIE:
What you know about bid, little girl?

---

## DAISY:
Deal the cards and I’ll show you.

---

## LOTTIE:
Now you gotta play, John. Takes four to play bid.

---

## JOHN:
Maybe you’re right. It’ll keep me occupied.

---

## LOTTIE:
Good thinking, John. You and Ginny gonna be partners? You already across from each other.

---

## JOHN:
You sure you remember how to play?

---

## VIRGINIA:
Yes, Pop, I remember.


---

## DAISY:
I wanna shuffle. And I wanna deal. 

---

## VIRGINIA:
You can’t do both.

---

## DAISY:
Fine. I’ll deal then.

---

## LOTTIE:
Ginny, you shuffle.

---

## JOHN:
Don't be getting mad when you start loosing Lottie. 

---

## LOTTIE:
Oh I got Daisy as a partner. We good.

---

## JOHN:
I guess you do remember.

---

## VIRGINIA:
Can’t forget playing bid. Though I haven’t done it in a month of Sundays.

---

## JOHN:
You rusty, Ginny? Because I expect to win.

---

## DAISY:
Y’all better expect something different, because me and Auntie Lottie about to set y’all straight.

---

## LOTTIE:
You hear that, John? Your daughter is over here trash talking.

---

## DAISY:
More like truth talking.

---

## VIRGINIA:
Daisy, you are out of control.

---

## JOHN:
She’s all right.

---

## VIRGINIA:
Aunt Lottie. Cut.

---

## LOTTIE:
John. You see how Daisy dealing? You got a card shark under your roof.

---

## JOHN:
Daisy, you been playing with Mabel Jones? I better not hear you’ve been throwing dice or something.

---

## DAISY:
What make you say that?

---

## JOHN:
Mabel’s mama and daddy let her do all manner of things. Staying up late. Chewing gum.

---

(VIRGINIA laughs.)

---

## JOHN:
You think that’s funny?

---

## VIRGINIA:
Bubble gum?

---

## JOHN:
It ain’t ladylike. No daughter of mine, under my roof, is gonna chew gum. Looking like some kinda ball player.

---

## VIRGINIA:
It’s not as though it’s tobacco.

---

## JOHN:
I don’t care.

---

## VIRGINIA:
Good to see some things never change

---

[A gunshot rings out]

---

## VIRGINIA:
Daisy. Keep dealing. You’re doing good.

---

[Silence]

---

## DAISY:
What you doing?

---

## LOTTIE:
What are you doing?

---

## VIRGINIA:
Take a sip, Daisy.

---

## DAISY:
I can’t!

---

## VIRGINIA:
Pop doesn’t mind. Do you, Pop?

---

## JOHN:
Tonight? I don’t care if y’all get right pissed.

---

## VIRGINIA:
See, Daisy? Pop knows how to let loose sometimes.

---

## DAISY:
It smells like gasoline.

---

## VIRGINIA:
Tastes a bit better

---

## LOTTIE:
I think chewing gum is the least of your worries.

---

## DAISY:
Your bid, Ginny.

---

## VIRGINIA:
Three. Downtown.

---

## LOTTIE:
I pass.

---

## JOHN:
Four. No trump.

---

## LOTTIE:
Alright then.

---

## DAISY:
I pass. Daddy wins the bid.

---

## JOHN:
We’re going uptown.

---

## VIRGINIA:
Pop, did you hear my bid?

---

## DAISY:
Uh-uh. No crosstalk. Auntie Lottie, let’s set these knuckleheads.

---

## DAISY:
No! They’re winning already.

---

## LOTTIE:
Be patient, Daisy. They still knuckleheads.

---

## DAISY:
Ha! Gotcha. That’s a relief.

---

## JOHN:
What gives, Ginny?

---

## VIRGINIA:
You’re the one who decided to go uptown.

---

## DAISY:
Y’all in trouble now.

---

## LOTTIE:
Good going, Daisy. One more and they’re set.

---

## DAISY:
Yes!

---

## LOTTIE:
Somebody’s four under.

---

## JOHN:
Daisy, where you learn how to play like this? I know it can’t be from no Mabel Jones.

---

## DAISY:
I’m quiet. I’m like a cat. I sit back and watch.

---

## LOTTIE:
Oh Lord. You drunk already.

---

## JOHN:
Ginny, I thought you said you remember how to play.

---

## VIRGINIA:
I do. You’re the one who seems to have forgotten.

---

## JOHN:
Excuse me?

---

## VIRGINIA:
Why did you overbid me? Aunt Lottie passed. And then for you to call uptown?

---

## JOHN:
I had it. If you would’ve followed my lead --

--

## VIRGINIA:
With what cards? I signaled you that I was high in diamonds and you wouldn’t lead a diamond.

---

## JOHN:
I lost the lead. Because of you.

---

## VIRGINIA:
How can you blame that on me? I bid downtown.

---

## LOTTIE:
It’s only one hand, y’all. Game ain’t over yet.

---

## JOHN:
It’s over for me unless I get a new partner.

---

## VIRGINIA:
No need for a tantrum.

---

## JOHN:
What was that?

---

## LOTTIE:
Maybe playing cards wasn’t such a good idea.

---

## VIRGINIA:
I just don’t see what I did wrong.

---

## JOHN:
You should’ve trusted me. Would I bid four uptown willy-nilly?

---

## VIRGINIA:
I don’t know.

---

## JOHN:
Oh, you don’t? Sound like you got all the answers. Waltz in here from Cleveland or Omaha or wherever you been and brought all the answers with you.

---

## DAISY:
Daddy, what’s gotten into you?

---

## VIRGINIA:
I don’t have all the answers.

---

## JOHN:
Sure don’t. If you did, I wouldn’t be giving room and board to your little gentleman caller up there.

---

## VIRGINIA:
George is not my “gentleman caller.”
He has nothing to do with this.

---

## JOHN:
You’re the one who brought him in here.

---

## LOTTIE:
Whose deal is it? John, I think it’s your deal next.

---

## JOHN:
Didn’t give a single thought to how Eugene might take you flaunting that man in his face.

---

## VIRGINIA:
Eugene and I have long since ended our courtship.

---

## JOHN:
Listen to that, Lottie. “Long since ended our courtship.” You talk like you white as butter.

---

## VIRGINIA:
If every single thing I say is going to be picked apart and ridiculed...

---

## VIRGINIA:
You reckon I oughta talk like dis, Pop? Like I’s just a fieldhand? Yessuh, massah boss, I don’t know no better, praise de Lawd, yessuh!

---

## JOHN:
You watch your mouth.

---

## VIRGINIA:
This is exactly why I avoid coming home.

---

## JOHN:
You made yourself scarce. Nobody did that to you.

---

## VIRGINIA:
Wasn’t it you who encouraged me to see the world beyond Grand Boulevard?

---

## JOHN:
Not as some white man’s whore

---

[silence]

---

## VIRGINIA:
Aunt Lottie, will you take Daisy up to the attic? My father’s right. It’s getting late and I think you’ll both be safer up there.

---

[Silence]

---

## VIRGINIA:
I hear y’all breathing.

---

## VIRGINIA:
White man’s whore?

---

## JOHN:
I didn’t stutter.

---

## VIRGINIA:
I was wondering when the father I knew would show up. Only so long you could keep up pleasantries.

---

## JOHN:
Look here. You can’t say I ain’t been hospitable. But I didn’t work my whole life your mother didn’t work herself to death cleaning on her hands and knees --

--

## VIRGINIA:
You know that ain’t why she died.

---

## JOHN:
-- just to see that this is what’s come of you.

---

## VIRGINIA:
And what’s come of me? An educated woman? A woman whose life ain’t in the hands of a man?

---

## JOHN:
Every time you gotta buy your separate ticket, sit in the separate train car... it’s a reminder you ain’t as good as he is, and you know it.

---

## VIRGINIA:
You’re being cruel. Even for you.

---

## JOHN:
Cruel? Try honest. You special enough to us, but not out there. Out there? You just another nigger. Except, in their eyes, you’re worse. Because you forgot your place.

---

## VIRGINIA:
Oh, I could never forget my place. I committed the unforgivable sin of straying from your grand plan for my life. 

---

## VIRGINIA:
Don’t embarrass the family. Stay quiet and shy. Be ladylike. Marry well, so I can trade one man’s authority for another’s. 

---

## VIRGINIA:
But then came the day I was foolish enough to tell you and Mama that I’d gotten myself into trouble. But you were nimble enough to devise a solution.

---

## VIRGINIA:
I was to board a train to the town of Normal. Downstate. You told everybody I was going off to school when you were really putting me in one of those homes. For girls in “trouble.”

---

## VIRGINIA:
I was to wait there while the “trouble” grew inside me, then give birth to the “trouble” and leave behind the “trouble” at an orphanage or a train station or who cares where. 

---

## VIRGINIA:
And then I was to come back to Chicago and tell everybody that I simply wasn’t cut out for something as silly as school. 

---

## VIRGINIA:
I missed Eugene too much and couldn’t delay becoming Mrs. Maxwell one moment more. 

---

## VIRGINIA:
But you could never give me to Eugene, or any other man, if he suspected I was... spoiled.

---

## VIRGINIA:
After all, John Bass doesn’t sell damaged goods.

---

## JOHN:
Forgive me, for trying to make the best out of a mess.


---

## VIRGINIA:
It’s not my fault you only had daughters. It’s not my fault that you had to take down the sign that said “Bass & Sons Dry Goods” when the doctor told you me and Daisy were it for you. 

---

## VIRGINIA:
You must have been so disappointed. And that’s all we ever got from you. Your fantasies about some storefront.

---

## JOHN:
Who gives a rip about a storefront when I’m about to lose this house?

---

## VIRGINIA:
What does that mean?

---

## JOHN:
I ain't say nothin

---

## Virginia:
Oh yes you did. You're about to lose this house? What does that mean?

---

## JOHN:
I’m behind. On everything. Especially the taxes. I worked my whole life for this house and it’s about to slip away.

---

## JOHN:
Hell, I hope they’re out there burning the store to the ground right now. At least then I’d get the insurance money.

---

## VIRGINIA:
How far behind are you?

---

## JOHN:
Drop it, Ginny.

---

## VIRGINIA:
I can’t just sit back and watch you fail.

---

## JOHN:
You got me sitting here thinking I might have this wrong. But that’s what you think of me, of us, ain’t it? 

---

## JOHN:
The people who brought you into this world and fed you and wiped your rear end. Failure. A two-story house. Failure?

---

## VIRGINIA:
Pop. Do you need help?

---

## JOHN:
Excuse me?

---

## VIRGINIA:
This is the house we’re talking about. If you need help -

--

## JOHN:
What it look like, a grown man taking money from his own daughter?

---

## VIRGINIA:
You’re not taking it. I’m offering it.

---

## JOHN:
So I can be in hock to you instead? Besides, if you got enough to get the bank off my back, you richer than I thought.

---

## JOHN:
You selling people expensive machines that plug into the wall. And all I got is... a few sacks of flour.

---

## VIRGINIA:
Oh, Pop --

--

## JOHN:
Don’t you dare. Things are bad enough without me having to choke on your pity on top of it all.

---

## VIRGINIA:
You said you weren’t gonna drink tonight.

---

## JOHN:
Am I that terrible, Ginny? Were you counting the days until you could get as far away from me as the rails would take you? I wish you would just say it, once and for all.

---

## VIRGINIA:
What? What do you wish I would say?

---

## JOHN:
That you’re ashamed of me. I’m ashamed of myself right now though, so I guess I can’t blame you.

---

[Eerie music plays as the grandfather clock strikes midnight.]


---

## VIRGINIA:
My father let you hold Alma?

---

## VIRGINIA:
I’m sorry!

---

## GEORGE:
No. I’m sorry.

---

## VIRGINIAL:
No, I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have startled you so. Especially since we’re all ready to come
out of our skins anyway. I’m just glad you didn’t shoot.

---

## GEORGE:
And I’m glad your father trusted me with his most prized possession.

---

## VIRGINIA:
Is he finally getting some rest?

---

## GEORGE:
Yes. It’s now my turn at the watch. I feel like Bernardo at Elsinore.

---

## VIRGINIA:
Bernardo at Elsinore? This is hardly a castle and Chicago is hardly Denmark.

---

## GEORGE:
You know Hamlet?

---

## VIRGINIA:
I was a teacher once, remember?

---

## GEORGE:
I remember.

---

## VIRGINIA:
At any rate, I’m envious of Bernardo. He only had to fear a ghost. Our perils are much more flesh-and-blood.

---

## GEORGE:
Indeed. But we will weather this.

---

## VIRGINIA:
Your optimism is infectious.

---

## VIRGINIA:
For all the grief my father gave you today, I must say. He is trusting you to watch the house and carry his treasured shotgun. That’s not nothing.

---

## GEORGE:
I’m honored.

---

## VIRGINIA:
Can I bring you some coffee?

---

## GEORGE:
No, thank you. I’m a ball of nerves as it is.

---

## VIRGINIA:
I am too. Trying to sleep was a fool’s errand.

---

## GEORGE:
I heard some of your... card game. With your father.

---

## VIRGINIA:
Oh?

---

## GEORGE:
Is he... angry? With you?

---

## VIRGINIA:
He’ll come around.

---

## GEORGE:
If it’s all on my account, which seems likely, please know that I never intended --

--

## VIRGINIA:
No. You were just. The easy scapegoat.

---

## GEORGE:
And I didn’t get the chance to apologize to you. For what I said at dinner. Making you tell that story about Louisville. So. I apologize. I truly thought we’d have a laugh.

---

## GEORGE:
We did have a laugh at the hotel, yes?

---

## VIRGINIA:
Yes. We did.

---

## GEORGE:
And that was our best week in years. We did terrific numbers.

---

## VIRGINIA:
Right. The numbers.

---

## VIRGINIA:
Since we’ve been getting such good “numbers,” as you say, and you said I deserve all the credit for those numbers -

--

## GEORGE:
Certainly. I’ll proudly tell anyone who asks.

---

## VIRGINIA:
I was thinking... I was thinking I might want to open my own sales account. 

---

## VIRGINIA:
In the morning, I’ll call the operator and have her put me through to the home office, and I’ll leave word for Mr. Edgerton --

--

## GEORGE:
Yes, but... why do you feel you need your own account?

---

## VIRGINIA:
I’m grateful for everything you’ve done for me, George, I really am. It’s just that... I feel like I should stand on my own two feet. Surely you understand.

---

## VIRGINIA:
George, are you alright?

---

## GEORGE:
I... I will be...

---

## VIRGINIA:
We’ll still be colleagues. I’m just trying to make my own way. And think of the bonuses we’ll get if we go our own separate ways? 

---

## GEORGE:
What brought this on?

---

## VIRGINIA:
It’s just that... my father has fallen on hard times and I feel compelled to help. In fact, I did offer to help, but then again, you probably know that if you heard our “card game.”

---

## GEORGE:
I didn’t hear every word, but what I heard didn’t sound pleasant.

---

## VIRGINIA:
That’s an understatement. But, his situation is unsure, so I think it could be time to ask Mr. Edgerton for his opinion about a pay increase for me. And the easiest way to do that would be to set up my own sales line.

---

## GEORGE:
I’m not certain this is the time for that.

---

## VIRGINIA:
Why not?

---

## GEORGE:
In my experience, those kinds of unsolicited requests can... backfire.

---

## VIRGINIA:
How will I know if I don’t at least try?

---

## GEORGE:
I’m asking you not to try. At least for now.

---

## VIRGINIA:
Why? You said yourself that I’ve always been woefully underpaid.

---

## GEORGE:
And I stand by that.

---

## VIRGINIA:
Then why wait?

---

## GEORGE:
Why don’t we give it a week or two before we reach out to Mr. Edgerton? See how we fare at the expo? I have a good feeling about it.

---

## GEORGE:
Depending on our numbers there, we could have even more leverage to negotiate an increase for both of us.

---

## VIRGINIA:
I’m not certain that we can wait that long.

---

## VIRGINIA:
George? George, what’s the matter?

---

## GEORGE:
Just. Please give me until after the expo to devise a solution.

---

## VIRGINIA:
I’ve already devised a solution. Didn’t you hear me?

---

## GEORGE:
You don’t work for Mr. Edgerton. Or, for that matter, for Edgerton Home Products.

---

## VIRGINIA:
I... I don’t understand.

---

## GEORGE:
You are not an employee of Edgerton Home Products.

---

## VIRGINIA:
If this is a joke, I can’t see the humor.

---

## GEORGE:
I wish it were a joke. I forged all of the documents that vouched for your employment. All the wages you’ve received have been out of my own paycheck. 

---

## GEORGE:
All the expense reports you submitted for reimbursement? I forged checks from the company so you wouldn’t suspect anything. As far as Edgerton is concerned, you don’t exist.

---

[silence]

---

## GEORGE:
Did you hear what I said?

---

## GEORGE:
Virginia?

---

## VIRGINIA:
The past three years of my life, I’ve been living in your fiction?

---

## GEORGE:
It’s not a fiction! You worked hard. And you earned money.

---

## VIRGINIA:
Money that you deigned to parcel out to me. Are you saying that none of that was real?

---

## GEORGE:
Of course it’s real.

---

## VIRGINIA:
How can you say that when you forged documents? I made all that money for a company that... that I don’t even work for?

---

## GEORGE:
You are employed in a line of work that is available to no one else in your station. Half my income is far more than you could ever hope to make hemming shirtwaists.

---

## GEORGE:
This is working for both of us, Virginia. Why don’t I ask for the pay increase myself?

---

## VIRGINIA:
And then what, I should just trust you to pass along the extra money to me? After you’ve already lied to me over and over?

---

## GEORGE:
Would you rather be broke?

---

## VIRGINIA:
You sound afraid. Are you afraid that I’ll contact Mr. Edgerton and tell him what you’ve been up to?

---

## GEORGE:
You know that if you speak to management, I will lose my job. And so will you.

---

## VIRGINIA:
According to you, I never had a job to begin with.

---

## VIRGINIA:
I should tell them. I should go take those papers from your valise and send them off in the morning.

---

## GEORGE:
What will that accomplish?

---

## VIRGINIA:
I don’t know. Maybe they’ll hire me and sack you once they realize I’ve been responsible for your success.

---

## GEORGE:
You don’t think I asked them to hire you? I did and then they laughed in my face.

---

## GEORGE:
And I laughed too. Because I had to pretend it was a joke. I’m not the one who held you back. I’m not the one who refused to see your potential. 

---

## GEORGE:
Your potential was the only thing I could ever see. It still is. Remember on the train to Memphis?

---

## GEORGE:
When I got so blind drunk I could hardly stand up straight? I slurred my words and stumbled so badly that the conductor put me in the colored car.

---

## George: 
The car you had to move to when we got to Carbondale. Do you remember that?

---

## VIRGINIA:
Yes.

---

## GEORGE:
When have you ever known me to drink?

---

## VIRGINIA:
So that was yet another lie. Another pretense.

---

## GEORGE:
I did it because I wanted to be near you. There’s no pretense about that.

---

## GEORGE:
I’ve said so many things I shouldn’t have. I have half a mind to turn this gun on myself.

---

## VIRGINIA:
If you expect me to feel sorry for you right now --

--

## GEORGE:
I wish you would feel anything else right now.

---

## VIRGINIA:
I will. In a moment. I’ll feel relief. When you’re gone.

---

## GEORGE:
What do you mean --

---

## GEORGE
Virginia?

---

## GEORGE:
What are these?

---

## VIRGINIA:
One of these is your clothing. The other one is the vacuum cleaner. I hope you’re able to get it fixed before the expo.

---

## GEORGE:
Virginia, don’t do this. I made a mistake.

---

## VIRGINIA:
So did I. But I’m rectifying mine now.

---

## GEORGE:
I don’t know this city. It’s a madhouse out there.

---

## VIRGINIA:
You’ll be fine as long as you keep a brisk pace. Walk out of here and turn right. When you get to the corner, turn right again. That’ll set you west. 

---

## VIRGINIA:
Then make sure you pass Michigan, State, Dearborn, and the railroad tracks. Then you’ll get to a street called Wentworth. People will probably be more friendly to you on the other side of Wentworth.

---

[Silence]

---

## GEORGE:
Everything you have, I gave to you.

---

## VIRGINIA:
Right, you’re off the hook now.

---

[The door slams]

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
Is everything alright?

---

## VIRGINIA:
Oh. Eugene. Yes.

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
I heard the door slam. I thought --

--

## VIRGINIA:
No. Nothing’s happened.

---

## REV. MAXWELLL:
You look shaken. What happened? Where’s George?

---

## VIRGINIA:
He. He’s... He left. That’s why you heard the door.

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
Where did he go?

---

## VIRGINIA:
The hotel downtown? I can’t be certain.

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
Will he be safe out there, though? It’s past three o’clock in the morning.

---

## VIRGINIA:
I gave him directions.

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
But he left you here?


---

## REV. MAXWELL:
Virginia? What is it...? Ginny. Talk to me.

---

## VIRGINIA:
Could we put on a record?

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
It’s a bit late for that, wouldn’t you say?

---

## VIRGINIA:
Why don’t you like music anymore? 

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
I still like music. Just not right now.

---

## VIRGINIA:
When did you get so square? You weren’t so square when we were young. Like you said. Remember? 

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
I know what I said. 

---

## VIRGINIA:
And I’m the only one who suffered for it.

---

## VIRGINIA:
Do you have any idea how hard it's been to look at you for these past twelve hours?

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
Go back upstairs then.

---

## VIRGINIA:
Do you have any idea how my life was turned upside down on account of-

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
On account of What?

---

## VIRGINIA:
That day in the church basement.

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
What day?

---

## VIRGINIA:
You know what day. 

---

## VIRGINIA:
Do you think I left you behind by choice?

---

## VIRGINIA:
I have spent years thinking about the fact that we could've been-

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
So sell me on it.

---

## VIRGINIA:
What?

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
You’re a saleswoman. So sell me. Sell me on the life we could have had.

---

## VIRGINIA:
I’m sorry. Sell you?

---

## VIRGINIA:
I’m not good at selling imaginary things. I’m better with consumer items. Like this one. This is a train ticket. 

---

## VIRGINIA:
For just four dollars and fifty cents, ride the Illinois Central Railroad all the way to a new town. To start a new life.

---

## VIRGINIA:
You can even use it to send away a young woman just because she finds herself pregnant. Never mind that she didn’t get that way by herself. 

---

## VIRGINIA:
Oh no, she had help from a boy she thought she loved, who she thought loved her. But this train ticket right here?

---

## VIRGINIA: 
You can’t use it to send the boy away. He preaches with the fire of the prophets. He has a calling on his life.

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
I have a child somewhere?

---

## VIRGINIA:
No. Neither do I. That all... ended. First on the train. Then in the bathroom of a station in Pontiac. 

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
Why didn’t you say anything to me?

---

## VIRGINIA:
What was I supposed to say?

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
Why didn’t your father say anything to my parents? We would have done right by you --

--

## VIRGINIA:
Who said your parents didn’t know? 

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
How can you tell me that right now? I’m in your father’s house.

---

## VIRGINIA:
So am I.

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
If you had told me --

--

## VIRGINIA:
Don’t do that, Eugene.

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
If you had told me, you wouldn’t have been on that train by yourself.

---

## VIRGINIA:
Ha! We would have been two kids on the train, having an adventure like out of some comic strip?

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
At least we would have been together. 


---

## VIRGINIA:
Perhaps, everyone thought your future was more important than mine.

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
All this time... I never knew. And earlier today I called you selfish.

---

## VIRGINIA:
I’ve been called far worse since then.

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
I have to make this right.

---

## VIRGINIA:
How?

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
Please forgive me.

---

## VIRGINIA:
For what?

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
For everything. For not knowing what you’ve been through. For not being the man you needed. For using a riot in the streets as an excuse to take you in my arms when I’ve wanted to do it since the second I saw you.

---

## VIRGINIA:
I made a mistake.

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
You have to forgive yourself. And I have to forgive myself too about what we did.

---

## VIRGINIA:
I mean coming home. There’s nothing for me here but regret. And people making me feel bad. Am I really that bad, Eugene?

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
No. You’re not.

---

## VIRGINIA:
What are you doing?

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
I’m walking in your direction.

---

## VIRGINIA:
Why?

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
I know we can’t start over, but we can at least finish what we started.

---

## VIRGINIA:
What do you mean?

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
You know what I mean.

---

## VIRGINIA:
My aunt is upstairs. My sister too. We are in my father’s house.

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
You’re a grown woman.

---

## VIRGINIA:
Eugene. I never promised you anything and I won’t start now. I’m not cut out to be a preacher’s wife.

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
Who said anything about preaching?

---

## VIRGINIA:
You’re a reverend. A pastor.

---

## REV. MAXWELL:
It ain’t Sunday no more.


---

## VIRGINIA:
Then I’m out of excuses.

---

[Soft piano music plays]

[sounds of early morning birds]


---

## LOTTIE:
So may we finally leave? Chuckie called and said it’s calmed down out there. For now. Besides, I would like to wash up in my own house.

---

## JOHN:
Lottie, you could’ve left anytime you wanted. You stayed even when we tried to feed you something that wasn’t ham.

---

## LOTTIE:
I stand by that.

---

## JOHN:
You get Ginny and Daisy up yet?

---

## LOTTIE:
They can get themselves up.


---

## JOHN:
What’s this for? Let me go. Like you say, you ain’t even washed up.

---

## LOTTIE:
John. I am so sick of your shit.

---

## JOHN:
Excuse me?

---

## LOTTIE:
You heard me. I’m sick of your shit. You know what that hug was for? You ain’t had enough hugs in your life. And it’s made you shitty. I am sick. Of. Your. Shit.

---

## JOHN:
That’s a lot of cussing, Lottie.

---

## LOTTIE:
You ain’t my daddy. I don’t have to be scared of you like Daisy is. Give me a piece of gum and I’ll chew it right in front of you. And dare you to do something.

---

## JOHN:
Daisy’s scared of me? 

---

## LOTTIE:
Everybody in this house is scared. And you the scared-est one of them all.

---

## JOHN:
I ain’t scared of nothing!

---

## LOTTIE:
You scared of your own shadow. That’s why I told my sister not to marry you.

---

## JOHN:
You didn’t tell Tillie that.

---

## LOTTIE:
Think I didn’t? I said, “Matilda Eloise Williams, what is this scrawny mess of a man coming around the house this much?” And she said,“I think he sweet on me. And I’m sweet on him too.” 

---

## LOTTIE:
And I said, “Okay, that’s nice, but you didn’t see him run from that horse fly the other day?

---

## LOTTIE:
That fly came in the window and he jumped up and started running away. Dropped his hat and everything. If he too scared to kill a fly --”

--

## JOHN:
I didn’t know it was a fly! I can’t believe you still bringing that up

---

## LOTTIE:
It made an impression, alright? You should have heard what we said about you after you left. We talked about you like a dog.

---

## LOTTIE:
But my hard-headed little sister didn’t listen. And I’m glad she didn’t.But after all this time? You still running scared and it’s making me not wanna be around you sometimes.

---

## JOHN:
Lottie, I’m not trying to hear this.

---

## LOTTIE:
You took her pictures down from there. You act like you the only somebody who lost Tillie.

---

## VIRGINIA: 
He does. 

---

## JOHN:
Ginny I'm not playing with you. It's been a long night. Who knows what's gonna happen today.

---


## LOTTIE:
If the two of y’all don’t get it together, and I mean soon, won’t neither one of y’all be welcome in my house. 

---

## LOTTIE:
It’s bad enough out there without all this upset going on in here. I told y’all I got this bad heart. Stop wearing it out.

---

## JOHN:
You’re up. I haven’t seen George.

---

## VIRGINIA:
He left. I decided to... stay behind.

---

## JOHN:
And Eugene?

---

## VIRGINIA:
He left too. I’m staying for his installation as pastor. After that, I don’t know. I’ll be at a hotel downtown if you need me.


---

## JOHN:
That’s silly. Just stay here.

---

## VIRGINIA:
I don't think that's all that good for me. So I’ll call and let you know where I end up.

---

## JOHN:
I should have got on that train with you.

---

## VIRGINIA:
Don't say that now just because yo feel bad. 

---

## JOHN:
I was doing the best I knew how to do, and I’m not about to apologize for that. But I should have got on the train with you.

---

## JOHN:
I should have sat with you the whole way. I should have held your hand. You shouldn’t have been alone. 

---

## JOHN:
Because later, when I came to get you and bring you back to Chicago, I saw that look in your eyes and I knew I had lost you. So I let you stay there.

---

## VIRGINIA:
You let me stay there?

---

## VIRGINIA:
Well, either way, Pop, you taught me that I didn’t need you anymore.

---

## JOHN:
I guess I gotta live with that.

---

## VIRGINIA:
I thought about not giving you this. But now you know what it’s like to be scared and alone.

---

## JOHN:
Your mama died. I had to raise two daughters by myself. I ain’t new to being scared and alone.

---

## VIRGINIA:
This is all the money I have on me. But I can get more. I’m owed one last paycheck from Edgerton Home Products.

---

## JOHN:
“Last” paycheck? What happened?

---

## VIRGINIA:
I don’t work there anymore. Things turned out... not to be as they seemed.

---

## JOHN:
Well, you can keep your money. Man named Elkins came by to see the house last week.

---

## VIRGINIA:
To... See the house? For what?

---

## JOHN:
What do you think, Ginny?

---

## JOHN:
He came up from Alabama or somewhere with his wife and son. Nice family. There’s a lot of folk coming up from down south these days. 

---

## JOHN:
And he seems like he got quite a bit of money. Even his suit was nice. Don’t know how he made all that money sharecropping but I ain’t asking no questions.

---

## VIRGINIA:
You already put up the house for sale? Who else knows?

---

## JOHN:
Nobody, yet. I was quiet about asking around to see if anybody was interested. I wasn’t about to put a sign out front for everybody to see. But I rang him up early this morning to see if he still wanted to buy the house, and... he is.

---

## DAISY:
You’re selling the house?!?

---

## JOHN:
Uh... I was gonna wait to tell you, Daisy, but yeah. I figured with Mama gone, and Ginny gone, this is too much house for just me and you --

--

## VIRGINIA:
Don’t lie to her.

---

## JOHN:
I got behind. On bills and things. But this is only for a little while --

--

## DAISY:
Not if you’re selling the house! What are we supposed to do, come back here “in a little while” and buy it back from him?

---

## JOHN:
Daisy, I promise you, everything will be just fine.

---

## DAISY:
You don’t know that.And you don’t know that either.

---

## JOHN:
I’d, uh... I’d better get down to the store and make sure everything is alright there. They better not have stolen anything.

---

## JOHN:
Oh, I almost forgot. Ginny?

---

## VIRGINIA:
Yes?

---

## JOHN:
Needles. For the Victrola. You said we were out. Then I came across these. Lucky, right?

---

## VIRGINIA:
Very. Thank you.

---

## DAISY:
Where are we gonna go, Ginny?


---

## VIRGINIA:
You know I’m only gonna be here a few days.


---

## DAISY:
Can I come with you?

---

## VIRGINIA:
I can't tell you what to do. 


---

## VIRGINIA:
When your father told me what to do at your age, he put me through hell.

---

## DAISY:
You're not the only one.

---

## VIRGINIA:
Daisy,I have been up all night. I have been fighting with everyone-

--

## DAISY:
I'm not fighting with you. I know everybody's been on your case.

---

## DAISY:
That's why I haven't said anything. But if you about to leave... I want my sister.

---

## DAISY:
Mama's gone, you gone, now daddy's selling the house? 

---

## DAISY:
I've been invisible since the day you left. All anybody could talk about was you.

---

## DAISY:
Mama's crying because you got sent away and now daddy's trying to figure out how to get you back and I know that I got to be the good one because you were the bad one.

---

## DAISY:
You think everything's just been hunky dory because I didn't get pregnant? I gotta get knocked up for somebody to care about me?

---

## DAISY:
I wish I could. Maybe then daddy would send me away too. Lookin at you it don't seem like it turned out all that bad. 

---

[morning bird sounds]

---

## DAISY:
You get headaches, that's my headache.

---

## VIRGINIA:
What are you doin?

---

[Victrolla starts playing upbeat dancing music]

---

[Music gets louder, now playing from the speakers in the theatre]

---

Thank you for attending *The Prodigal Daughter*
