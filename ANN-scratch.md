## COLLEGE PRESIDENT:
[Voiceover.] Welcome, welcome everybody…
Before we introduce our distinguished visitor, we’re going to show some film many of you will certainly remember.

---




## ANN:
Thank you!
Thank you!
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

---


Buenas Noches, Mis Amigos.

---

Twelve years ago, Barbara Jordan—another Texas woman—Barbara made the keynote address to this convention—and two women in a hundred and sixty years is about par for the course.

---


But if you give us a chance, we can perform.

---


After all, Ginger Rogers did everything that Fred Astaire did, she just did it backwards and in hi-i-gh heels!


---



## COLLEGE PRESIDENT:
[Voiceover.] Will the graduating class, and all here, please welcome Governor Ann Richards!

---


## ANN:
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

---


Well, how great you guys put on that music!
You know, we used that in every campaign of mine!

---


I never tired of it—I would even play it on a little tape recorder and earphones on the Hike-and-Bike Trail, and it always chuffed me up!

---


And my Lord, but it does take me back to see a bit of that keynote speech that changed my life forever…Well, look at you, y’all clean up pretty well. 

---


I thank the senior class for inviting me to speak at your graduation…I bet some of you jus’ remember ME ’cause of my hair.

---


You know, I notice most of the guys who tease me about my hair don’t have any.

---


I am glad to be here—to help swing the doors wide as you take wing to a new time in your life— 

---

But I don’t know if this class has any idea what happens when they invite someone who could also be their grandmother to come speak, because I have a lot of opinions.

---


Can you imagine if I were your mother-in-law?
I could fix you.

---


Now, before I go any further, I probably should mention, since you could be from all over the country, you might think I was the first female Governor of Texas, so I want to rush to disabuse you of that notion.

---


Texas elected its first female governor way back in the 1920s.
Her name was Ma Ferguson.

---


Ma was called Ma ’cause she was married to a man named…

---


## AUDIENCE:
Pa!

---



## ANN:
This is a pretty sharp crowd. And Pa was Governor of Texas.

---


He was impeached for selling pardons to people in the penitentiary, and when they carted Pa off to the pen himself, Ma was elected in his stead.

---


Her campaign slogan?—was “two Governors for the price of one!”

---



Now, there was a driving issue in Texas at the time that will soundsomewhat familiar, even today—about whether or not children were to be punished if they spoke Spanish in the public schools.

---


They asked Ma what she thought about it, and Ma said—this is true—Ma said, “If the English language was good enough for Jesus Christ, it is good enough for the school children of Texas.”

---

And I’ll bet you also don’t know that the Father of Our Country was born in Texas.

---


And when he was just a slip of a boy, he took his li’l hatchet, and walked out into the backyard, and chopped down the family mesquite tree.

---


And when his father walk’ out into the yard and saw the only shade for fifty miles lying dead on the ground, he called him out, and he says, 

---

“George. Did you cut down this mesquite tree?” And George says, “Well, yes…I cannot tell a lie, I took my li’l hatchet and I cut the tree down.” 

---

And his father says, “Well, Son, we are going to have to move to Virginia.” And George says, “Oh, Father, do we have to move ’cause I cut down the tree?!” 

---

And his father says, “No, Son—it’s because if you can’t tell a lie, you ain’t never gonna amount to anything in Texas.”

---


President and members of the Board of Trustees, esteemed faculty, proud graduates—and relieved parents.

---


It isn’t just you pink-cheeked youngsters who face the unknown today…

---

Our nation is in the throes of a “commencement,” if you will, more dramatic than I have seen in my lifetime.

---


We now move forward from our Industrial Age into the new Information Age—and this enormous shift puts the burden on your generation.

---


Now, earlier in the century, the simple move from the Agrarian Age into our industrial economy—from the farm to the factory floor—asked nothing new of America’s workforce.

---


You understand?
Work still meant having a strong back and putting in the hours to do well.

---


But this no longer holds true.

---


For the computer consoles, which now run the world…a strong back, and sweat of the brow, are not what is required.

---


We face a daunting change.

---


So, look—we’re all nervously twirling our mortar board tassels this day.

---


Oh, my goodness, it just got so quiet in here!

---


Come on, y’all know every commencement speech has to have a gloom and doom part.
That was it.

---





Now, what I must do is congratulate your girls’ basketball team on landing in the top three of the Southwest Conference! 

---


I loved basketball when I was at Baylor, and I am a big Lady Longhorns fan!

---

—When I first started going to their games, I was so staggered to see Barbara Jordan there.

---


Here was I, this awestruck li’l housewife, and there was this great American patriot, her chair drug up to the scorekeeper’s table—and on a bad night for the team, she would pound that table with the flat of her hand, and say in the voice of God, 

---

“Can we not, I say, can we not shoot any better than this?” 

---


Oh, man—There was simply something about Barbara Jordan that made you proud to be part of the country that produced her.

---


I still get a catch in my throat to think that, fifteen years later, she would chair my campaign for Governor.

---


Well, y’all, I just love being in this part of Texas!
My Daddy was born just up the road from here.

---


’N’ when I was growing up in the early 1930s, it had to be unusual that a father—a simple man, didn’t go past eighth grade—would tell his little girl, his only child, that she could do anything she wanted to in life.

---


But he said it a lot—and he told me that I was really smart so often that I believed him.

---


Wadn’t till I got to college, th’t I wondered if he might be wrong.I suppose I owe my natural confidence to my Daddy.

---


But y’all—confidence for what?

---


When I was young—back in the Bronze Age—little girls did not envision careers.

---


Even nursing and teaching, so desperately important—they weren’t thought of as careers back then.

---


Truth is, they were basically jus’ extensions of what was expected of women anyway.

---


Man, had I had a crystal ball—back there when I was a kid in Lakeview, that wide spot in the road where I grew up near Waco—where there was no lake to view—

---

and had I seen that I would become Governor of the great State of Texas, the ninth largest economy in the world, I would have fallen backwards off the porch laughing!

---


My childhood was as simple as a crayon drawing.

---


My Mama, who was called Ona, was one tough bird.

---


My Daddy, Cecil, was pure sunlight—’n’ I see both of them in me like a swirl dip cone.

---



I was Daddy’s pride and joy, but my Mama looked at me with anarrowed eye, and she jus’ pulled me through a knothole my entire childhood.

---


I suppose we were poor—this was the middle of the Depression—but I don’t like the word, I prefer “hardworking.” 

---

My Daddy worked for the same pharmaceutical company all his life—first as a driver, and then a salesman—and he left the house early and he came home late.

---


And I don’t believe I ever once saw my mother idle.

---


We lived in a little clapboard house she basically raised upherself—drew it out with a builder, bought the materials, hired laborers in town.

---


Mama was as hard as the nails that held that house together.

---


The day I was born in that house—you see, there was no star in the east—on that day, a neighbor came by to help make dinner for Mama and Daddy.

---


But the woman didn’t know that a chicken needed killing, and she just couldn’t do it.

---


So my Mama, right there in the birthing bed, hunched herself up on an elbow and wrung that chicken’s neck for her.

---


Mama said!—when she taught me to sew—that if the seam was not straight, or if the stripes did not match on the seam, that I’se gonna have to pull every one of those stitches out with my teeth, on Judgment Day!

---


One day I began to understand that I would never, ever, ever please my mother—and that’s when it sorta got funny!

---


When I gave that big keynote speech in Atlanta, the TV station back home in Waco, KWTX, set up this big ol’ watch party, where my parents crowded in with a whole lot of people to see the thing on a live feed.

---


After the speech, I was kinda dazed, but I knew it had been a big deal, so I call ’em up on the telephone!

---


And Mama says, “Ann! Ann!…You’ll never guess what happened…something really wonderful!” 

---


And I get all warm, and I say, “What, Mama, what?” And she says, “Oh, Ann!…I got to meet the Channel Ten Weatherman!”Oh, God…I tell these stories on my Mama…but no, I do owe her gratitude. 

---


I got her grit.

---


She taught me that you move on.
You don’t cry over spilt milk.

---


In fact, if my Mama is your Mama, you better not cry at all.

---

Now, my father was a darling man.

---


He usta take me by the hand—now I was this little bitty thing, and he is six foot four…and he’d say, “Let’s go, Puss!”—and he’d take me fishing, which I thought then and still do was the grandest thing you could do.

---


And we’d visit the drugstore—you know, with the chairs out front—and the barbershop—those places old guys gather and sit, and joyfully greet each other, as if they hadn’t just spent the day before sittin’ together!

---


My Daddy was the greatest storyteller.
But awful, bawdy stories, oh no—just the worst.

---


It’s why I developed such a taste for dirty jokes.
I can’t resist ’em, I admit it.

---


I wish I could tell y’all a story of his, but I can’t!
No, I can’t, they’re really too nasty.

---


Oh, wait now—no, there is one I might could tell.

---

And I know the Board of Trustees would be disappointed if I didn’t tell one just a little risky.

---


So it seems there’s these three dogs are put in a pen out at the vet’s.

---


Some little terrier type, a bulldog—and a Great Dane.

---


And they fall to talking, wondering what they’re doing there—and the li’l terrier says, “Oh, I got in big trouble, I bit this little girl’s ankle real bad and, well…I’m afraid they’re gonna put me down today.” 

---


And the bulldog says, “Why, that’s terrible”—and the terrier says, “Well, what’s your story?” 

---

And the bulldog says, “Well, it’s sorta similar…I chased our neighbor’s cat, and I caught it—and I just ripped its throat out, and they’re gonna put me down, too.” 

---


And they both look over to the Great Dane, and say, “Hey, Pal, wh-what’re you in here for?” 

---

The Great Dane stretches out and says, “Well, guys, it’s kinda like you. 

---

I was just sitting in the living room the other day, and my mistress come in out of the shower, a towel wrapped around her, and she bent over to pick up a newspaper

---

…and I don’t know what came over me, but I jumped up and I mounted her.” 

---


And the other two dogs go, “Oh, my God! What are they gonna do to you?!” 

---


…’N’ the Great Dane says, “Well—they’re gonna trim my nails and try to do something about my breath.”

---


Like I said, a darling man.

---


So while I wasn’t groomed for greatness, I am sure that my political career rested on the ease I felt out in the world with Daddy—and certainly amongst all those good ol’ boys.

---


Of which he was one.

---


But for all that fatherly warmth I had in my life—there was something else, too, gave me a sense of belonging in the world, from when I was a child.

---


Something that happened.
We were in the middle of the war…The big war, of course—

---


Japan had just entered the fray—and my Daddy was drafted into the Navy.

---


Soon he got stationed in San Diego and had to leave us. Now, we were not a touchy, huggy kinda family, but the day he left, he reached down for me and burst out crying.

---

After he’d been in California a few months, Mama and I just couldn’t stand it.

---


She yanked me out of school—killed every chicken we had, canned ’em, canned everything in the garden—wedged our belongings and us in the old worn-out Chrysler we had, and lit out for California.

---


She’d never been much further than the grocery, but oh, no, she drove us across the whole darn country herself.

---


When we finally arrived, Daddy said we looked like The Grapes of Wrath. 

---


So there I was—from this teeny, tiny crossroads in the middleof Texas—over  to sprawling San Diego, where you got to look down on an ocean!

---


I took a city bus to a big public school, with thousands of kids—and they were all nationalities, all colors, all stripes and sizes…

---

there were brown kids, and Italians, Asian, and Greek students, Hispanics and black children—and those kids were all exactly like me. 

---


Oh, it was a moment to make you blink.
I just flat never understood racial prejudice after that.

---


I may have only been a child, but I think I saw plain, there was a way people could live that you all would call fair play.

---


But at the same time—I saw, it was no sure thing in this world.

---


For where I grew up, why…segregation was—rooted!—just an unnoted aspect of every day life. 

---


So there, in my eleventh year, what with this fabulous vision of the confetti of kids who were all my new friends, my eyes popped open—and I never knew they were shut!

---


Life was never the same for me.

---


Stepped down offa that bus—and into the world.But the passion I suddenly felt for—well, what?—simple fairness—was personal.

---


And, yeah, by the time I grew up into this young Austin housewife, it did become political—but that didn’t mean I’se gonna be in politics.

---


Shoot.
It never entered my head I’d ever serve.
In the fifties?

---


How ridiculous! Now, with my young husband, David Richards, it was another story.

---


He was a civil rights lawyer, and he knew absolutely everything.

---


’N’ for David and me, politics was like going dancing or bowling for other couples. Hell, we were tacking campaign posters to telephone poles on our honeymoon! 

---

When I was a girl, back in high school, big star on the debate team and all, it made perfect sense I would fall madly in love with David Richards, and he with me.

---


He was tall.
Almost as tall as Daddy.

---


He was really, really smart, and we loved to talk.
Unlike other teenagers, he had no cruelty in him.

---


As a boy, he read the story of Robin Hood over and over, and he would always cry salty tears when Robin dies at the end.

---


David wanted to protect people who needed help too, and in a very real sense, that is what he would do with the law.

---


Our song was Tony Bennett singing “Blue Velvet.” We married at nineteen.

---


In those days, that was not thought to be too young.I was happy as could be.
We both were.

---


And I felt that taking care of my husband and my children was my profession, ya know?—all the way into the sunset.

---


So I set about making kids—we quit at four—and David made a big hit arguing out under the trees with all the crusty old Democrats at Scholz’s Beer Garden, and I was content just to soak it all up, knock back those cold beers, and worship at David’s shrine.

---

And I thought my duty in life was to be perfect.
Perfect wife, mother, lover, nursemaid, cook, you name it!

---


If it was in the glossy magazines, I was doing it.
I wanted to be, and I was, everything to everybody.

---


And if I had a spare fifteen minutes, I’d plan a big ol’ dinner party for sixty!

---


I took the Waco Women’s Club motto as my own—“If we rest, we rust!” 

---


—And I did all of it with this prideful energy that was floating just on top of desperation.
But of course, I didn’t see it that way.

---


Not when there was a vodka martini with a twist waiting!

---


And, believe you me, there always was.

---


A-a-anyway, by then, I was already focused on the hard practical reality of fixing stuff in my community.

---


Ya know, like getting stop signs put up at bad intersections, stuff like that.

---


I was like the poster child for Functioning Alcoholics Everywhere.
And I functioned all over the place! 

---

And on the political front?

---


—W-e-e-ll, by then—I had long since quit getting coffee for the guy with the clipboard, and I had learned how to put together a smart campaign.

---


I helped several women run for office—much younger than I, of course—women of real stature.

---


Like Sarah Weddington, who at a mere twenty-six had just argued Roe v. Wade.
We ran a good race, Sarah won a seat in the Texas House.

---


I had an adrenaline rush that should’ve been illegal, but then, ya see, my job was done…

---

Sarah had to go to work, but I could just go on home, plant the new garden, give the dogs a tick bath—and face once again how far apart my husband and I had grown.

---

I am bemused!—that in that racetrack world of politics I loved, with its glamorous images of running and taking the lead and winning the roses…I always saw myself way up in the stands!

---


I never saw myself as the horse!
And nobody else threw a saddle on me either!

---


Maybe ’cause I’se kinda like the class clown in our gang.

---


It’s very tricky when a woman is funny.

---


’N’ of course, there was the drinking.
Yeah, well—drinking was no help, y’all.

---


I know I crossed the line one time, going to a costume party dressed as a tampon.

---


Well—you can sorta see it, can’t ya?

---


So, I wasn’t on anybody’s lips as a likely public servant. 

---


However, I was on a fervent mission to get other women—not me, other women, and minorities, to participate in government—with this group that traveled all over the state.

---


The local chapter was run by this fabulous girl named Jane Hickie, and she spied me as someone who could sell this stuff like hot cakes—so we put our act together and took it on the road, looking for women with a glint in their eye.

---

One fine day! 
—It’s always on a fine day, idn’t it?

---

—One fine daya bunch of our politico friends came over to persuade my husband to run for county commissioner—sort of like a “governor,” on a small, li’l local scale; 

---

it—it’s executive in nature.
But David was deep in important civil rights lawsuits…and he says nah, he didn’t want to run.

---





So then everyone’s in our li’l ol’ kitchen, sitting around moping, ’n’ one of them says, “Well, Ann—why don’t you run?” I think I was at the sink.

---


There was this pause…And somebody else goes, “Hummm…” Like, did they want tomato soup or chicken noodle?
I was just a fill-in.

---


Women never did those big jobs!—But see, they didn’t have anyone else they could run.

---


So—we do the precinct research, and fuss about it for weeks, and—turns out, all our pals think I got a shot!

---

Then finally, my husband says, “Ann, if you don’t take a chance, you’re gonna wonder about this the rest of your life.” 

---

Well, my blood ran col’. He and I may have seemed like a permanent institution to all our friends, after—ya know—twenty-odd years, but a lot of love had gone under that bridge, and now we were pretty ragged.

---


Somewhere I knew if I won that county commissioner job, I could only do it whole hog.
All in.

---


I feared our marriage would not hold.

---


And, of course, I was right!

---


In those next first years of my public service, when my whole life was expanding—everything that made me feel like me was collapsing!

---


Hey, I wasn’t drinking for nothing. 

---


Now, lissen…about the drinkin’…look, ya’ll—I was fun!

---


We gave parties for absolutely no reason.
And I really threw a bash if it was Thursday.

---


I musta drunk eleven hundred thousand martinis by the time I landed in AA—and by then, I was this big ol’ County Commissioner! 

---


—So, I like to think I broke a barrier for politicians with an addiction in their past.

---


And nowadays, hell, you can’t hardly even get into a primary unless you’ve done time in rehab. 

---


I went to rehab—’cause a bunch of my friends and family snuckup on me with this intervention deal…and I was like traumatized—seeing all of ’em sitting there, looking like The Lord’s Last Supper!

---


I thought something had happened to one of my children!

---


When I got the drift, I thought, “Well, if this idn’t a pile!

---


You all were right there drinking with me!” 

---



But, one by one, they all told me what I was like when I was drunk—and you…you just can’t even hear that stuff.

---


Then one of our dearest old friends says, “Ann, we named our only daughter after you.

---


We want her to be proud of you.” I was on a plane to a treatment hospital that very night.

---


“Drunk School” we called it! 

---


And yeah, I must’ve learned something about myself the month I spent there, ’cause I was sure glad to be sober when, pretty soon after, David and I made our goodbyes.

---


I was by then well into my forties…I had never been alone one minute in my life.

---


I thought if I was not married to David Richards, right into the sunset, I was gonna die.

---


And when he was finally, really gone—I am mortified to tell you, I actually took up knitting.
But time passed…and I was still alive!

---


And you know what?

---


It just seemed like a better idea to become Governor of Texas instead! 

---


But back in that hot kitchen!—back at that crossroads—when he said, “You should do it, Ann.”—I froze…and then, the clock went tick—and I moved ahead.

---


And without even knowing it—I placed my bets on me. 

---


And work, work was the best antidote for fear—So, I hit the gas!
Besides, the notion of running was catching on.

---


Gears were turning ’n’ clipboards were flying, and before I knew it, all my network of women arrived, on their brooms, with their law degrees and checkbooks and Rolodexes.

---


I had the sense to snag that Jane Hickie person as my campaign manager, and she may have been fifteen years my junior, but really, she was like a mentor to me—

---

and she is so wicked smart, you don’t know what the hell she just said, but you know it’s good! 

---


We started planning.
All of us around our big ol’ dinner table! 

---


Shoot—we knew how to do it!
I was suiting up.

---


Gosh—I was happy…and now, there was a glint in my eye.

---





Now, don’t get me wrong, being a mother meant everything to me— 

---


But my kids were pretty grown, and here I had this chance to put to the fire things I had stood for all my life.

---


If I was ambitious, it’s because I know that life is not fair.

---


I had learned that at eleven.

---


Life idn’t fair!
But government should be.

---


And thus began my career. 

---


County Commissioner for six years, then elected up to State Treasurer, for a couple of terms…
Who knew this meant endless campaigning!?

---


And it is some hard work on the road.
Buses, beat up ol’ vans, state fairs— 

---


Ya ever been to a state fair?
Without a hat?

---


Up to our eyeballs in balloons and bar-b-cue—forging on from town to dusty town.
You understand?

---


Texas is bigger than France!

---





But fifteen years on that fast track of Texas politics seemed to agree with me.

---


Hey—other than mud in your face, it’s fun!

---


And then, outta the blue, along comes that big keynote speech in Atlanta, and suddenly, half the damn country—sees me as the horse.

---


I musta been on the front page of every newspaper in the English speaking worl’!

---


My supporters dropped their popcorn and burst into flame!

---


They turned their eyes to the Governor’s Mansion.

---


Ye Gods!
Did we dare?
Yeah, we did.But, lissen y’all, on paper?

---


A woman, a divorced woman?—a ten-year-sober alcoholic—and a Democrat, no less?!

---


Running for Governor of macho, conservative Texas—Well, get back!
That is insane!

---


Even though I had done really well in public service—off the charts, if you must know.

---


We raised more non-tax money for Texas than all the treasurers in the history of the state combined—even so—no one thought we could actually take the Capital.

---


But a lot of powerful people, and everyday folk too, they went beyond thinkin’—they just felt in their blood that, somehow, I could.

---


And they went with their blood.

---





Now y’all have to know, Texas politics is a contact sport.
No autopsy—no foul.

---


That campaign was the most stressful thing I had ever done in my entire life…

---


Well, other than teach junior high school.

---


But even the most brutal gubernatorial race in recorded history couldn’t knock the wind out of our hope to make a new Texas—where the doors of government were OPEN, and everyone got to come in. 

---


The national press was all over that race.

---


One guy wrote, “Ann Richards has walked through fire. And the fire lost!” 

---


And those people who figured they could easily deal with this white-headed old lady—soon discovered that, while I may have what Molly Ivins called “Republican hair”—the reality is, kids, it’s best you know—

---

I come from Georgia prison stock!

---


Fifteen years after knocking on my first door, I found myself the Governor of Texas.

---


Older and wiser, I had learned by then what not everyone knows—it takes one person to run, and it takes quite another to actually govern…

---

[intercom buzzes]

---



Yeah?

---



[intercom buzzes again]

---



Nancy?

---

[buzzer]

---

Who IS it?
I’m not taking any calls unless it’s the President of the United States of America.

---



## NANCY:
[Voiceover.] Well, according to Bill, he still is the President, amazingly enough.

---

## ANN:
Omigod.
Hiya, Kid, how are ya?

---

Well, it sure does make a girl feel good a President returns her call so quick.

---

…Yeah, it’s a program we are all fired up about in Texas—the report’ll be on your desk tomorrow—a really creative approach to ending the welfare cycle, 

---

that I genuinely, Bill, I genuinely think could be the model for the nation, and I urge you to give it your attention.

---


…No, yeah, the pilot program is up and running like gangbusters in San Antonio—Why should Washington reinvent the wheel, when Texas already has it rolling?

---


…Thank you, Mr. President.

---


…Oh, I think Senator Kerry’s doin’ great!—I’m gonna keep October clear as I can—you need me up in Massachusetts, I’m all in—“money, marbles and chalk.”

---


…I love you too, Bill. Bah.

---





Nancy, this Edward person, that Ivy League guy doing the Mexico State visit—Did he call?
Or did he just send this stupid fax?

---





## NANCY:
[Voiceover.] No. He hasn’t called.

---





## ANN:
Chicken shit.

---





## NANCY:
[Voiceover.] And Governor, I have not found one of your children…I left messages for Clark and Ellen and Dan, but Cecile’s machine didn’t even pick up.

---





## ANN:
Keep trying all of ’em!—OK!

---


This trip is in ten days—I have no hotels, no liaison to President Salinas!—So much for diplomatic relations.
How dare this guy!

---


Nancy, did the Chief of Staff make it back from Washington yet?

---





## NANCY:
[Voiceover.] Yeah, I think she just did.

---

## ANN:
Oh, my Lord, there’s no airplanes— Hi, welcome home.

---


Mary Beth, this asshole Edward, who’s doing Mexico—that guy couldn’t organize a circle jerk.

---

…I don’t care who hired him—won’t be the first time Cathy Bonner was blinded by a cute butt.

---

…Just roll him back to Commerce like the spare tire he is.

---


This is a State visit, for God’s sake!
—Get Moya.

---


He’ll find somebody sharp to take over who is at least from Mexico! 

---


Now, Mary Beth, I know I said I wouldn’t ask you to work at night if I could possibly avoid it, and I haven’t, you know?

---


I mean—look, I’m not asking you to come to this meeting tonight, when you’re just back and all—but tomorrow is that big reception for all the governors, and I’m gonna need you to stay and walk me into the room.
Just get me started.

---



…Hell, no, I’m not gonna ask him!

---


Why do I always get drug around by the Lieutenant Governor?
Bob Bullock and I aren’t even speaking this week!
Why can’t you do it?

---


I am so weary of fussing with this man—Why can’t my Chief of Staff bring me in?

---

…You will be home early!
Just get me through the door.
I’m fine once I’m in the swing.

---

…Oh, this thing tonight is just—I need some help about this kid’s scheduled to die.
It’s just so murky to justify it, but I seem to be considering a stay.

---

…No one around here remembers a Governor giving one, soit musta been a long time ago!

---

Mary Beth, go over to your windows and look down at the front steps.
Do you have a crowd gathering over there yet?

---

…Yeah, well, it’s all over the news, now the Pope is horning in on this, for God’s sakes.

---


The Lord’s eye may be on the sparrow, but the Pope is lookin’ at Texas.

---


…No, no, that case comes up next month, this is the one where that abused kid raped and killed the seventy-six-year-old nun.

---

…I know, who can bear it?
My Mama is seventy-six.

---


But you can’t believe this boy’s childhood.

---


When he’s a baby his parents put him bare-bottomed on a stove burner—his father lets his thug friends rape him—Really sick stuff.

---





…I’m sure a stay will bring ashes down on our head, but—

---

…Oh, yeah, I agree, no, I have to go with what I feel—But lissen, I gotta run, I can’t even face that music ’til tonight, after El Paso.

---

…OK. Bye—


---

…What?? Oh, for pity’s sake, I was not mean to Suzanne.

---


I beat on her, because if I don’t, she will NEVER finish writing a speech!

---


Hell, I am the one under a magnifying glass around here—I always have to be on—if I can’t let my hair down with the people I love, when can I?

---





…Oh, that’s funny, Mary Beth.
Look—I, I do “let go and Let God”…but HE can’t make Suzanne do anything, either.

---


…OK. Bye.

---


Nancy, get me my travel aide. I think it’s Donisi today.

---





## NANCY:
[Voiceover.] Oh, Ann, he just stepped out, he’s been trying to get something to eat…

---


## ANN:
Well, I need him…

---


## NANCY:
Oh, boy. I’ll send someone to catch him…

---





## ANN:
Ellen, there you are!

---


Your mother here—I haven’t heard from any of you kids about our long weekend—I’m just sitting here like an ol’ fool, assuming you’re all coming?

---

…Well, OK, then!

---


Lissen, I want you to go rent a small van,charge it to me, and bring that set of red chairs in Cecile’s attic down to the beach—I want ’em for the housekeeper’s daughter.

---





…Darlin’, you do this for me—just remind me, you ain’t ever gohn have to cook or wash up, you’ll be “the princess of the van.” 

---

Now, you telephone everyone to hit the King’s Inn around lunch-time and I’ll take off forty-five minutes after you do, my guys drive me a hundred miles an hour.

---


…No, you  call, Cecile is just nuts with those twins.

---


Oh, say, Dan tells me that Clark is still making noises about not coming down this year.
Did you talk to him…?

---





…Well, I mean, it is just ludicrous, this thing over charades, good God.
Put Clark on the same team as Jane—she’s the one made him so mad.

---





Darlin’, I gotta get on the stick.
King’s Inn.
Fried shrimp!!!

---


…OK. Bye.

---


Yeah?

---


## NANCY:
[Voiceover.] I’ve been holding Donisi on the line.
He’s wasting away.

---





## ANN:
Nancy, this whole damn pile of stuff in the orange folder can’t be essential?
I’ma be signing till the Crack of Doom…

---





## NANCY:
[Voiceover.] Yes, Governor, I was careful to put in only what has to go out tonight.

---





## ANN:
God. Donisi, ya know—we have this whole big award thing tonight, I have to go back over to the mansion and tart myself up.

---


So meet me over there in an hour.

---


Now, I’m ’bout outta my mind today—do not let me leave for the airport without my blue tote, and you keep it with you.

---


It’s got the death penalty file in there.
I hafta fly right back and meet with General Counsel on it tonight.

---


Damn,this will be the latest I ever called in a decision.

---


So we’re gonna split before the dinner—and don’t let anybody engage me, just shovel me out and back to the mansion by 8:30.

---


And keep your nose in a book, Mr. Chatterbox—first chance I’ll have to think all day is gonna be on the plane.

---





…What else?
Somethin’ else—Oh, yeah.

---


I can’t be out of reach if the Court has some action on this case, so bring the air phone.

---


Bring the backup, too—and whyn’t you charge ’em this time, just for laughs.

---

…OK I’ll see ya over there.

---


Nancy?
Do we still have shoe sizes for everyone in the outer office?
From that time we gave the sneakers?

---





## NANCY:
[Voiceover.] I’ve got a list tucked away.

---





## ANN:
Good.
Make me a copy.

---


I don’t suppose by any miracle Suzanne has faxed my speech…

---





## NANCY:
[Voiceover.] She says she’s going to fax it right to the El Paso Hotel.

---





## ANN:
O-o-o-h, she’s gonna fax it over there??

---


OH, w-e-ell, that jus’ fills me with confidence.
Goddammit, I can’t wing that speech!

---


And plus, I’m s’posta talk about every one of those awardees!!
What is the matter with her??!

---


If she wasn’t so darn good I would just…pinch her head off.

---





Oh, so—call over to the boot factory—you know, that girlfriend o’ mine’s store in El Paso—they’re having a big sale.

---


And someone make fresh coffee, this stuff’ll kill us all—  

---


They’ll find thirty people lying dead on the floor, it’s gonna look like Jonestown around here.

---


—Where in God’s name are my kids???

---



[Buzzer of Intercom]

---





## NANCY:
[Voiceover.] I got your Boot Lady.

---





## ANN:
And Nancy, get me that son of a bitch on the Insurance Board—he thinks he’s gonna play me!
Wait’ll I blow some smoke up his ass.

---


Hey, d’you hear all that?

---


It’s Ann!

---





…Now, lissen, Darlin’, I’m flying to a thing out your way tonight, and we’ll drive right past your place, so I thought I would hit the sale and buy a big bunch of boots for my secretarial staff  here.

---



…Oh, probably eight, ten pair.

---





…No, I wanna pick ’em out—We’ll just throw ’em in the trunk and fly ’em home.

---

…Oh, sure—I’m happy to say hi to everyone—but warn ’em we’re going through like a dose of salts, I can’t linger.

---





…Thanks a million.

---


See ya then!

---





## NANCY:
[Voiceover.] I’ve got Jaston Williams again, Ann.
Susan Rieff says he’s not gonna back off.
She got nowhere with him.

---





## ANN:
Well—shit, Nancy…

---





## NANCY:
[Voiceover.] He’s been trying to catch you all morning—yesterday, too.

---





## ANN:
But Susan Rieff is supposed to be my junkyard dog!

---


I have to pick my battles!

---


I cannot airlift that nuclear dump away from his mama’s town—and that is federal stuff, not state!!
Dammit all.

---


Well, just tell him I love him, make time for him to come in…
What am I gonna do with him?

---


Ye Gods, I don’t have to worry about my enemies, my friends are gohn kill me!


Oh, c’mon, Ann, you gotta do better than that.

---


Nancy, tomorrow—I want to see that brief on nuclear waste out in Hudspeth County…but also, I want to see the provisions in our border treaty with Mexico that protect the Rio Grande river.

---





## NANCY:
[Voiceover.] Yes, ma’am.

---





## ANN:
Now, how in the world did this dumb fringe come loose off this flag here??
You been moonlighting as a drum majorette??

---


Oh, rats, I forgot.
I can’t believe I am so stupid.

---


Lissen, I have atask for, uh, uh—oh, that little round girl I like, in Appointments—Sandra!
Sandra Castellanos!

---


She was so sharp doin’ that interview the other day—You know what, pick some cute trinket outta my “good job” drawer and put it on her desk when you leave tonight.

---


Now, all those scraps of paper and cards from those folks I met at the Brownsville demonstration—Sort ’em and put ’em on a list so I can send notes.

---


I never saw such a bunch of hardworking people…How good is Sandra’s Spanish?

---





## NANCY:
[Voiceover.] Serviceable.
I mean, Sandra’s born here, Ann, in Seguin.

---





## ANN:
Oh!
Oh.

---


Well, she better brush up, ’cause now she’s their point person.

---


Tell her this one woman in particular—her name is on the back of that colored Saints’ prayer card you got there—Sandra is to track her down today.

---


The woman brought her son with her.
Probably nine years old.

---


This child lives in a house in the Colonias—a house with no water, and no electricity—and I don’t know how—but he is gonna be something.We’re putting an arm around this boy’s shoulder.

---


I want him up here…I want him…OK, where is my blue binder?? Oh.

---


I want him up here next week for children’s day at the mansion, with all those fat capital brats—Nancy!

---


I’m looking at my calendar—Why in Hell is there nothing but one thousand erasures on the FOURTH?!
Godammit!

---


Call down to scheduling, they’re supposed to keep this binder up to date!
Does anyone around here do their job?

---



And try Suzanne again.
I am this close to sending somebody over there.

---


She’s probably got a chair up against the door by now.

---





## NANCY:
[Voiceover.] OK, Governor, I have Sally for you, from scheduling…Now, she’s new, Ann, so don’t make her—

---





## ANN:
This is Ann Richards.

---


Say!
Are you the girl with the green eyes and the bangs?

---





…I want to suggest to you that you rethink the bangs.

---


You don’t want to look like a little girl in an office situation, it’s hard enough for women to be taken seriously as it is!

---


Now, I’m here looking at my schedule, and why in the world is the Fourth of July empty?…Well, my Gaaahhhd, if that was canceled, why wasn’t I informed?

---


There’s an idea for you.
And why wasn’t something filled in from the wait list?

---





…Oh!
Uh, uh…I see.

---


Well, I suppose it’s darling that y’all wanna give me a “day off.” 
What is your name again?

---

…Sally.
Well, Sally—you are new here—so let me bring you up to speed.

---


I did not get myself elected Governor of the great State of Texas to spend this nation’s most important holiday loafin’ with my family and sittin’ on my ass—I gotta earn my keep!

---


—So just go look for some sweet little town and find me a PARADE, Sally!

---



Nancy, what did I even do when I got in here from Johnson City this morning?

---





## NANCY:
[Voiceover.] You went right into the staff meeting.

---


Then you had the shake ’n’ bake with the guys from Northrop Grumman, cut the ribbon on our day-care rooms—then the Catholic Bishops’ emissary came, then—

---





## ANN:
Then I had lunch at my desk—I’ve been chained to this telephone ever since.

---


I don’t believe I’ve been to the bathroom.

---





## NANCY:
[Voiceover.] Well…you would know, Governor.

---





## ANN:
Oh, no.
I hardly pay any attention.

---


Well, I am going to go now.
I’ll be right back.

---


And if my Mama calls, don’t tell her where I went.
She says going to the bathroom is a sign of weakness.

---

<!-- ACTTWO -->

---



## ANN:
Well, I-I-I-I am a new woman!

---


Man, there is nothing like being swarmed by thirty little girls from Brownie Troop Five Twenty-Six in a four-stall ladies’ room to put things in perspective!

---





## NANCY:
[Voiceover.] Governor, the President needs you to get back.
What do you want me to do?

---





## ANN:
Well—go ahead and call him!

---


Oh, hey, Nancy, look up that documentary guy.
Tommy somethin’—who did the Roe v. Wade story.

---


Wadn’t I supposed to phone him in a quote after the pro-choice march?
Weren’t you supposed to remind me?

---


If I have missed his deadline, I’m going to blame you.

---





## NANCY:
[Voiceover.] I’ll find him.

---


It’s a Boston station.
Governor, this is the President.

---





## ANN:
You just can’t get enough of me, can ya?

---





…Yes, I am.
I am as strong as mustard gas.
What’s up?

---

…Um-hmm.
Well, I would put cash money on a barrel to see Barbara Jordan keep her cool around Clarence Thomas.
But I don’t know that she could go on the Supreme Court.

---


…Well, her health is so bad.
And what with the wheelchair and all?

---





…Oh, no.
Bill, she’s always in it now—still does her ethics seminars for me, though.

---


Lemme send Jane out to Onion Creek to talk with her.
Jane’s only one I got smart enough to go.

---


…Yes, no—It is a grand notion!
I will get back to you.

---


Thank you, Mr. President.

---





I think Barbara might have too much sense to go on the Supreme Court.

---


Nancy, find Jane and ask her to telephone me tonight around uh, oh—eleven.
Tell her to hold on to her hat.

---





## NANCY:
[Voiceover.] All right.
The reporter’s on.
And the deadline is today.

---




## ANN:
To-DAY!
Sometimes I can’t even believe how sharp I am. 

---

Hi-i-i-i, Tommy!



…Well, I remember men who care about Choice.

---

…I do.
You wanna tape like a forty-five second quote, right?

---

…OK, hit “record.”

---

…Oh, Honey, this is a subject on which I am always loaded for bear.

---


…Ya ready?

---


Here we go. I think it is really important, not only that we talk about a woman’s right to choose—but what about this current attitude towards children who are already on this earth?

---


They say, “There’s no money to help the children you already have, but, tsk, tsk, tsk, we’re gonna force you to have some more you can’t afford…” 

---

And lissen here, Americans want to take care of their parents and grandparents—but these right-wingers tell us, “If you can’t pay for doctors or nursing homes, that is tough—

---


You take your elderly parents back in!” 

---


And we say but…“But, wait a minute, this is 1993!—Everybody in our home works.

---


There isn’t anybody home to take care of our parents!—and the government should live up to the promise their social security taxes paid for.” 

---


How’s that, Tommy, d’you get what you need?

---


…Well, Young Man, thank you—and Tommy—thank you for what you do.

---




## NANCY:
[Voiceover.] Ann, I’ve got your son, can you speak to him now?

---


Dan says he’s only on a teeny break.

---


And, then, uhm, David Miller needs to talk with you urgently.
There’s a problem— 

---


You have to pay for one of the planes he put you on—it can’t be a gift.

---


He doesn’t want to come up here to see you, he’s too scared—but it seems he’s got to cover the expense today, Ann…

---



## ANN:
Oh, well, just shoot me now… Put him through when I’m done with Dan.

---




Brother, it’s your Mama.

---


Lissen, I need you to check who all wants to go fishing—I have to call down and reserve boats.

---


…You let me know tomorrow ay-em.

---


…So you get to bring the ham this year.

---


…No, I’m getting Clark to do the turkey.

---






…No, I’m not asking Cecile to cook meat when she doesn’t eat it and doesn’t like handling it, for Heaven’s sake—she’s gohn make pies like she always does.

---


…Now, Dan—when we play charades, for God’s sake, quit tormenting Clark, and give him something a person can act.

---


We have almost lost him over this.
I don’t know why you are so hard on him—I wish I had a baby brother who adored me.

---


…Oh, don’t test my patience, Dan.
Spare me the drama.

---


…OK, Son. Bye.

---


David Miller, this is the Boss of the Applesauce.

---


I understand that you don’t want to see me?
What’s the deal?

---


…You have got to be joking.
Eight thousand dollars??—I’m not gonna pay that.

---


…Oh, get back, how could this man lend me his planes if he has a kid in JAIL, is he out of his mind?
But d-d-did you not VET this guy??

---


…Well.
This is just the biggest screw up of your young life, idn’t it?

---


I-I can’t even believe this.
My dealings have always been impeccable.

---


Jesus, Mary, and Joseph!
Goddammit!!! 

---


Man, I am not a rich woman—This is, like—more’n a month’s pay!
And I cannot go to campaign funds for this!

---


I am not about to drag the sack to donors who’re generous to me because they believe I am good for Texas, and tell ’em I need a whole big bunch o’ more money ’cause this kid I stupidly gave an important job to screwed up!

---


…David Miller—are you crying?

---


Quit that.
Nobody’s dead.

---





Now, what is the amount—eight thousand seven hundred and what?— 

---


…Oh, yeah, no, no, don’t let’s forget that last four bits.
I’m leaving this check on my desk.

---


I’m taking off for El Paso.
And I don’t want to see you, either.

---

Nancy, call over to the bank and warn ’em a big check’s coming through for eight grand and change and they should just—I don’t know, slide it over from savings, I guess.

---




## NANCY:
[Voiceover.] Ann, your mother’s neighbor called to ask what to do, seems Ona is up on the roof cleaning out the gutters and the lady is in a state…

---



## ANN:
Well, I’ll bet Mama thinks the rain is gonna take out all those nineteen-cent periwinkles she just planted, so—just say there ain’t nothin’ to do but leave her to it.

---



## NANCY:
[Voiceover.] All right.
I’ll tell ’er.

---



## ANN:
As if falling off a house would hurt my Mama!

---


Nancy—Call that fool David Miller—and get his shoe size…and put him on the boot list, too.

---


And if he asks you why you want it, you just tell him he ain’t on a “need to know” basis around here!

---





Anything from Suzanne?

---



## NANCY:
[Voiceover.] I’m sorry, Ann.
No.

---



## ANN:
WHY DO I EVEN ASK?!
What is the matter with me,  that I just continue to endure this?

---


Suzanne!!

---


Now, you know perfectly well I’m walking out the door in two minutes, and if you don’t get that speech to me over in El Paso, I will let all those people down, and plus, look like a horse’s ass on the news tonight!

---


So, my question for you is this—do you want to kill me?

---


Just give me one good reason, one reason, why I shouldn’t just hire any of those boys out of Washington or New York who can write like crazy and who would kill a puppy for your job.

---


I am the fucking Governor of Texas!

---


I half wrote that damn speech myself, all you had to do was type it, and…

---





…Well, to add insult to injury, your stupid answering machine just cut me off!

---


Suzanne, when I think of the opportunities to shine this job has given you—I just marvel that you don’t spring up in the morning and rush to your desk in gratitude.

---


You’re just sitting there, aren’t you?

---


Yeah, you’re sittin’ there, drinkin’ a warm beer—and you’re thinking, “Oh, she gohn get over this just like she always does…” 

---


Well, don’t count on it, Suzanne—that’s—all I have to say.
Don’t count on it. 

---


I need an AA meeting.

---





If I had “The Big Book” I’d kill her with it.

---


Oh, my God, Nancy,look at the time…I haven’t caught all my kids!

---


Where is that Clark? 

---


Well, Hi-i-i-i-i.
It’s your mother.

---

…Well, Clark, yeah—I heard that, but as the kids say—that doesn’t work for me.

---


…Oh, c’mon—You have to come, you have to fish with us! And Clark, lissen, it’s your turn to do the turkey this year

---


…No, Dan is already doing the ham.

---


…Well, OK, then, order one from Rovan’s—but, boy, you better call them right now.
Oh, you know what, never mind, I will cook the turkey myself!

---


…Now, Clar, Clar—CLARK, get over it!
Charades is just a game!

---


Nobody could have done “The Rob Lowe Sex Tapes.” I don’t know why you get so upset—everybody knows you’re the smartest person in the room!

---





…Well, get yourself on Jane’s team, and you can be mean as a snake, too! 

---


…Cla-r-rk.
“Move on!” 

---


…OK—Love ya.
Bah. Nancy, call over to General Counsel’s office and find Talbot.

---


Find Bill Cryer, too—He’s gohn have to write a press release big time.

---






## NANCY:
[Voiceover.] Talbot called a little bit ago saying he wasjust then leaving the Attorney General’s, he knows to speak with you regarding tonight.

---


I told him you already had the death packet with you.

---



## ANN:
Well, OK, but then where is he?
He knows we have to do this.

---


I’m getting on an airplane!
Why must I ride herd on everyone?!

---


…Bill Cryer!
Fancy finding the Press Secretary at his desk!

---

Lissen, I hope you haven’t got some new girl setting her hair on fire over you—I need you at the Mansion at 8:30 to meet about this capital case.

---


Right now I’m feeling in my gut I just might stay this guy’s sentence, and if I do, our press release has to be ready.

---





Cryer, why in Hell haven’t you gotten one of your hot-shot Pulitzer reporter buddies to do a big piece in the newspaper about what governors can do or can’t do with these cases?

---


Why aren’t you on top of this?!

---


People don’t even know what a stay is—that it’s onlythirty days—they’re callin’, begging me to give a pardon, and they have absolutely no idea that only the Board has that power!

---


Not that the Board would ever do it.

---


And if the public is so in the dark, I feel like I’m pushing a rope in front of me!

---





…Well, you ain’t making your presence felt, ’cause I can’t catch a break with the press

---


—Right now on the news they’re saying Governor Richards “did not take” Mother Teresa’s call!
I was giving a speech!

---


—It’s not like I hung up on her.

---


…Well, OK, you get started writing the shortest statement we can make.

---


And you better write it so my Mama can understand it!

---



[Buzzer.]

---



## NANCY:
[Voiceover.] It’s David Talbot.

---



## ANN:
Yeah, don’t let him go anywhere.

---


Now, Billy—about my pitching that fit at the airport yesterday—I guess I flamed your ass.
I s’pose I owe you an apology.

---


Well, y’ain’t gohn get one.
See ya over there.

---




Talbot—Talbot, I hired you as my General Counsel ’cause youare one smart lawyer, ’n’ I love you to death—

---


But I read your very long summary—and, and, I-I thought you’re supposed to make me understand better, not make me want to pull my hair out!

---





…Look, Talbot, you are the lawyer, and I am the Governor—you have to explain the options this guy has before the law, and you have to recommend, for Heaven’s sake—

---

and why on earth would you cite this whole bunch of cases as if I knew what all these precedents were—
are you writing for the Harvard Law Review?—or are you helping me wade through this—this mare’s nest?

---





…I don’t want you to be sorry, I just want you to do your job.

---


Now, Talbot, lissen—it’s getting a little crazy over here.
The Amnesty people are doing a die-in on the Capitol steps—so you better come in the side doors, and I’m not kidding—

---



They will know who you are.

---



…Yeah, I’ve got every Catholic Bishop in the state, plus allthe nuns from that poor nun’s convent, delivering me letters today begging me to give this man a pardon.

---


Mother Teresa called to lean on me—

---





…Well—from India, I guess…and now they’ve brought me this letter from, who is this now?

---


—The papal nuncio, with a message from the Pope—it’s got seals and ribbons—looks like a Christmas present.

---


Think of that, Talbot, the Pope has an opinion on this case. And you don’t.

---


…You say that every time, but if I take it as a given someone actually ending up on death row means every avenue of the law has already been exhausted, wh-wh-what the hell am I doing here?

---





…Well, that is small comfort.

---


So, I need you tonight at the Mansion about 8:30.

---


John Hannah will be there.
And Bill Cryer, of course.

---


We need to seriously look at this.
I’m not OK with it.

---


…Yes, I am.
I am considering a stay.

---


…Look!—the guy started out in life with NO CHANCE.
The whole deal is pitif—

---



…But—if his lawyer was so negligent, how can it be that there’s no way to introduce that now?

---






…Well—well this is just a quagmire.
Texas can’t go on this way.

---


Truth is, I find I am so affected by these nuns forgiving him.
That old girl lived in that convent more than half a damn century.

---





Those Sisters were all she had.
That’s what they wrote me.

---


“We are her family.” And they knew the guy—just some pasty-face ne’er-do-well.
Some dim-eyed kid who slouched around their neighborhood.

---


—They want me to stop this.
They forgive him. Well, I’m gohn tell you right now—I’m gonna do this thing.—

---





And you watch!
More people will protest the stay than give one damn we put him down—like he’s a—a—animal.

---


…All right.

---


No—8:30.

---



## NANCY:
[Voiceover. Mild.] Governor?
Are you off?

---



## ANN:
Do we have any cookies out there?

---



## NANCY:
[Voiceover.] No.
You ate ’em all.

---



## ANN:
I’m not taking any calls.
I’ve got to get ready.

---



## NANCY:
[Voiceover.] Well, Ann—I’ve got Lily waiting, she’s so excited about something.
I did tell her you were here—Sorry.

---



## ANN:
Lily belle!
How is my nearly perfect grandbaby?

---





…You did?!
Well, I’m not surprised.
I expect you to be the smartest one.

---


Did they give you a prize?

---


…Ohhh, Charlotte’s Web !
I love that book.

---


Now, you know
you’re coming with me and Barbara Jordan to the Lady Longhorns game…

---





…Well, now, no, no, wait—We can play gin rummy, too!

---


But now, Lily—lissen to me.

---


You only pick up face cards if you really need them, not just ’cause they’re pretty—You only gohn get stuck with all those high points, you understand?

---


…Well, o’ course I beat you, your Mammy’s a shark.

---


Now, Lily, I gotta go work, but I do need your Mama—

---





…I love YOU!

---



…How are you, Darling?

---






…Well, shoot, Cecile, what do you expect—you’re the mother of new twins, you are certifiably insane.
But ain’tnobody gonna’ give you a blue ribbon for working yourself to death.

---


You need some help.

---


…Now, Darling, can you do the pies?

---


…Oh, that is fabulous.
You’re my star!

---


…Yeah, no, Clark is coming, but he’s still a little cranky.
We just pair Clark with Jane—it’ll be fine.

---


…Yeah, I’m jumping on my broom, too.

---


…Well, we’re gonna see you down there! Bah. 

---

Nancy, I am out of here.
Everything waits ’til tomorrow.

---





God, I wish I had a LuAnn Platter “to go.”

---



## NANCY:
[Voiceover.] I have Bob Bullock screaming that you were supposed to call him today, and he needs you to get on the horn right now.

---


He says he isn’t gonna talk to any of your hairy legged zoo-girls.

---



## ANN:
No day would be complete without a shot from Bullock!

---


The orange folder stuff is all signed, I’m leaving a check for David Miller on my desk, under the blue armadillo…and you tell Bob Bullock he can stick a broom up my ass and I will sweep out the office for him, but I cannot take another call!!

---



## NANCY:
All right, Governor.
I’ll be happy to give Bob your message…

---





## ANN:
Well, I mean…

---


Can you imagine if I left these behind?
I’m getting so forgetful, soon I’m gohn be able to hide my own Easter eggs.

---






After four years of this mad intensity, came re-election time,even though my popularity in the polls was stronger than ever it was, I did not win my second term.

---


Everybody’s brother-in-law had opinions as to why, but rehashing all that crappy dirty tricks stuff  jus’ didn’t interest me much.

---


I’ll tell you what, though—if I got turned out over my concealed weapons veto—without which every Tom, Dick, and Harry could jus’ walk into your home, or your place of business, packing heat!!

---


—then I say, “So be it!”—and “Sayonara!” More guns in people’s pockets was gonna mean more people dead.
There was no compromise to be had.

---


Now, I did tell ’em, I tol’ ’em, I might could consider a lawthat let guys carry guns hanging from a chain around their neck.

---


That way, we could say, “Look out, he’s got a gun.” And the idea of women carrying guns around for protection?
Give me a break, Gladys.

---


There idn’t a woman in Texas could find a gun in her purse.

---





All that aside—  Where was the sense in lookingback?
It was over.

---


My little granddaughter Lily asked me, she says, “Mammy, does this mean you don’t have a job?” I said, “Darlin’, it means everyone you know doesn’t have a job!”

---


I have to confess, I wadn’t gonna miss the stress.

---


But I did miss the children in the classrooms—those kids who usta grab me around the knees…and I think of the old people—who really need a voice when they’re trapped in wheelchairs in dirty nursing homes.

---


The person who holds this office really must have a conscience to know—that how they direct this government dramatically affects the lives of real people, who are counting on them.

---


The good news is, we had rung a bell they could never unring!

---


More important than legislation, more important than vetoes,and the bully pulpit—was our promise that we would put together a government of citizens—that for once looked like the population of the state!

---


Where there would be no persons in all of Texas who did not see others, serving in office, who looked just—like—them.

---


’Bout three thousand appointments to office—many of them female, Hispanic, Black, gay, Asian, disabled—Republican!
Oh, yeah—yeah, I did.

---


We didn’t care about the flak.
We did what we wanted, and we didn’t look back—and I’ll tell you what.

---


An awful lot of folks were terrifically proud of their great state.

---



And on a personal note, let me just say—you haven’t lived ’til you’ve been Governor of Texas.

---



Following an old tradition, I marked a passage in the Good Book for the incoming Governor: Amos 5:15, “Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish justice in the court.”

---





I loved that when the new Governor asked my comptroller John Sharp whether he wanted to be called Mr.
Comptroller or Mr. Sharp, and how had Governor Richards addressed him?

---


—John said, “She just called me Darling.”

---


Now, y’all—While it was the greatest honor of my life to serve Texas as its Governor, and jus’ wonderful to come to know its people—

---


Being Governor was my job.
It wadn’t me.

---


Walking out of the Governor’s office—I was sixty—I had no house—no big ol’ white car anymore—and no cash to speak of.

---


I thought, “Well?—Shoot.” 

---


In those wee hours, I did wonder if my age-old fear was gonna come true—I’d end up in a trailer in my daughter Ellen’s driveway.

---


You laugh, but you’d be surprised how many women feel like that.

---


But before I could open a bait and tackle stand—which seemed like a good idea at the time—low and behold—half the civilized world was at my door!

---


I can’t even tell you, all these TV talk shows, the boards I was asked to sit on—and the speeches I was invited to give.

---


You know my frien’ Cathy Bonner says I was born under a special star—and sometimes I think that’s true—’cause lissen to what happened.

---


Out of the blue comes along these hotshot guys—big-deal consultants, don’tcha know—who invited me to come play with them.

---


They figured I knew how the world works—they also needed a person who, just for starters, could get anyone in the country on the telephone.

---


Well, yeah.
So that was nice, who could complain?
But wait, it gets better—

---






Seems like my seventh decade was gohn be a whole new carnival ridein my life—’Cause, can you believe this, they asked me to open an office for them, in New York City!

---


So there I went!—From a tree-shaded capital—from Piney Woods, rough rivers and hills—

---





—over to a world of glass and steel, and impossible heights— 

---


Why, why, from my window I could almost see the curvature of the earth!
And all those people!—I was terrified!

---


I was thrilled!
—And, man, did I hear America singing.

---





SANDRA? Sandra—Check and see if Suzanne emailed that draft.
I’ma hafta take a stick to her.

---


You know what, just call her.
Use the fax line, maybe she won’t see it’s us.

---


Now, Sandra, this itinerary here for Chicago—google me up whoever else is on the dais at this dinner.

---


Oh, and call over to that Disney guy and ask what Sunday I can buy five good seats for the Lion King matinee—
Man, this is gonna be like my seventh time at that show.

---


I could play Simba’s Mama by now.
Ask for six seats and you come again, too.

---


Do you believe we get to do stuff like this?

---


Awww!
Lookit this crossword puzzle Bill Clinton sent.

---


Did it with a fountain pen, of course!
That no good—Lemme just—

---





…Just the biggest show off I ever met in my entire life.

---


…Hey, there, Bill!

---


Oh, no, no, I got it—And the fact that I am a clue in this is kinda moot—I know perfectly well you only sent it so I would take note you worked it in ink.

---


Heh, heh.
I love you Darlin’.

---


…We’ll see you when the creek goes down. Bah.

---


Oh, say. Bill?
Hang on a sec.
I forgot to ask you—

---






…No, seriously, lissen, you’re gonna know the answer to this.

---


So, now, uh—if you—if you are born in Arkansas?—and you get married in Arkansas—but then you move  to Texas, and you get a divorce?

---


Are you still brother and sister?

---




[Phone rings.]

---



Yeah?

---





Suzanne?
My Stars. Hiiiiii.

---


So, look, this speech is in good enough shape—I’ma switch it to Brandeis, and we’ll save that first amendment stuff for NPR.

---


Better for them anyway.
But the way we close is too dry, too abstract.

---


And it is so dark.
I’m afraid those poor people in the audience are just gonna slash their wrists.

---


…Yeah, no, jus’ get a good joke or something outta my file and stick in there.

---





But, now—when we’re talking about Katrina, and how here a year later nothing has happened—I want to change the focus from us complaining about the government to looking at our part in it.

---




I mean we all do this, ya know?

---


We all whine and complain,“The government is horrible—they don’t do this!’n’ they don’t do that!” Hell, I complain about “they,” and I was a governor!

---


So use the line, “we hafta quit whining, and start participating.”  

---


My Lord, Suzanne, half the country doesn’t even vote!

---





OK!

---


Start with this: Think—think of all those people from around the globe who leave everything behind—their homelands, their families, all they have—to come to our country, where they can vote.

---


Put that in.

---


Then jump to something like—ahhh—
Let’s look at the big picture.

---


What will they say of us?
What will they say of our time?

---


That here—in the land of the free, voting—somehow—fell out of fashion?

---



’N’ lissen, it’s not that good things always happen when good people vote—But it is darn sure true that bad things happen when they don’t vote.

---


And voting is the least of it.

---


I don’t understand people who turn their back on it all—because the government is the most pervasive institution in our lives—And if you don’t participate, you’re just letting other people make some big old decisions for you.

---


I’ma cut to the chase.
The government isn’t “they”!
The government—is you!

---


It is me, it is us!—and sometimes “us,” not at our very best.
Public servants work for you—

---





You have the power to call ’em out, and call ’em down.
YOU hire ’em, you can fire  ’em!

---


If they are racist, if they are sexist, if theyare wrong—YOU—MUST—CALL ’EM OUT!

---





And instead of complaining about “they,” whyn’t some a you infiltrate the enemy!
Become one o’ them—for real!

---


True public service requires a passion, and I know there are always those few who have the grit for it.
Lotta you women won’t even contemplate it ’cause you see politics as so dirty.

---


Well, I wish you’d think it over.
—Hell, Girls, we’ve seen far dirtier fights in the PTA!

---


And besides which, the nation needs you!

---





Simply viewed, while our men are great fighters—women have a talent for bringing consensus.

---


Ya know?—It’s all those hours at the dinner table, trying to make sure everyone has their say and gets a piece of the pie, too.

---


For me, and a lot of public servants, it is almost a calling—

---


Not from “on high”—but from within—that in our core we feel we can make life better for people, in a way beyond our own family.

---


But for all us citizens—men and women—we’re all in this together.
We should all pull together.

---






That way—maybe we’ve got a shot.

---


And anyway, why should your life—be just about you?

---




I never got to give that speech!

---


But you remember what John Lennon sung to us, about how life happens while we’re busy making other plans?

---


Well, my plans were pulled up short with a bad turn in my health.

---


Do you know, just the word “cancer” is so potent people even look down when they say it.

---


So here was another battle in my life—and I ain’t never run from a fight yet.
I was gonna approach it the way I did anything: “Hit the gas.”

---





Before you get some fancy idea I was a big hero about it lemme tell you—I am sure I cried my share.

---


Well, shoot, nobody wants to go.
But you know what they say about battles—“You can’t win ’em all!”

---


Now, this is gonna sound funny t’ y’all, coming from me,but the memorials and the funeral that my old staff and my friends and my family pulled together in about one day, were just…so…FABULOUS.

---


There’s President Clinton, speaking in the Capitol rotunda,  with me under a flag.

---


Oh, for God’s sake…I mean, it was like they were planting a general or something!

---


And then this other deal, where Hillary spoke, with, with—seriously—thousands of people, and gospel singing, and big speeches, and stories—

---


and at the very end, my all-grown-up grandbaby Lily spoke—and was, I have to admit it, entirely perfect.

---


There was this poem Jane recited that long ago I had stumbled on and really loved—and I casually tossed it to Suzanne, and said, “Save this for me,” you know?

---


In case I needed it for a funeral…Yeah, of course, I wasn’t thinking it’d be MINE!!

---





It has lines like—“Call me by my old familiar name.” Love that.

---


And—“Whatever we were to each other,that we still are.” 
And then, uunh, oh, yeah—  “I am somewhere very near.”

---


Now, traditionally,  you’re supposed to close these things with a pearl of wisdom—but what do I know?

---



Look kids, the here and now is all you have—and if you play it right—it’s all you need.

---





I wish for you…

---


That you would value the love of your family and friends as if your life depends on it.
Because it does.

---


That you would take that chance on your dreams, and bet on yourself.
After all—

---


You gotta go out on a limb, ’cause that’s where the fruit is.
Well, thanks a lot.

---


Gosh, it is good to see you!

---


It’s good to be seen!

---


God bless you—and Daddy, you were right—I was smart, and I could do anything I wanted to!
And Mama… 

---


Well—you got to meet the weatherman!
