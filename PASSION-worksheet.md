## CLARA:
I’M SO HAPPY, I’M AFRAID <br>
I’LL DIE
HERE IN YOUR ARMS.<br>

---

WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF I DIED
LIKE THIS— <br>
RIGHT NOW,
HERE IN YOUR ARMS?

---

THAT WE EVER SHOULD HAVE MET<br>
IS A MIRACLE— 

---


## GIORGIO:
NO, INEVITABLE— 


<div class="fragment">

## CLARA:
THEN INEVITABLE, YES,

## CLARA:
BUT I CONFESS<br>
IT WAS THE LOOK—

## GIORGIO:
THE LOOK?

## CLARA:
THE SADNESS IN YOUR EYES<br>
THAT DAY

---

WHEN WE GLANCED<br>
AT EACH OTHER <br>
IN THE PARK.


<div class="fragment">

## GIORGIO:
WE WERE BOTH UNHAPPY.


</div>

## CLARA:
UNHAPPINESS CAN BE SEDUCTIVE.


<div class="fragment">

## GIORGIO:
YOU PITIED ME…


</div>


---


## CLARA, GIORGIO:
HOW QUICKLY PITY LEADS TO LOVE.

---


## CLARA:
ALL THIS HAPPINESS<br>
MERELY FROM A GLANCE<br>
IN THE PARK.

---

SO MUCH HAPPINESS,<br>
SO MUCH LOVE…

---

## GIORGIO:
I THOUGHT I KNEW WHAT LOVE WAS.


## CLARA:
I WISH WE MIGHT HAVE MET SO MUCH SOONER.

---

I COULD HAVE GIVEN YOU—

I THOUGHT I KNEW WHAT LOVE WAS.

THE HAPPINESS I FEEL WITH YOU.

IN A PARK.

NOT BY CHANCE,<br>
BY NECESSITY—

## CLARA:
SURELY, THIS IS HAPPINESS—

—BY THE SADNESS THAT WE SAW

IN EACH OTHER.


<div class="fragment">

## CLARA:
—NO ONE ELSE
HAS EVER FELT BEFORE!

## CLARA & GIORGIO:
JUST ANOTHER LOVE STORY,<br>
THAT’S WHAT THEY WOULD CLAIM.

---

ANOTHER SIMPLE LOVE STORY— <br>
AREN’T ALL OF THEM THE SAME?


## CLARA:
NO, BUT THIS IS MORE,<br>
WE FEEL MORE!

## CLARA & GIORGIO:
THIS IS SO MUCH MORE—!<br>
LIKE EVERY OTHER LOVE STORY.

SOME SAY HAPPINESS<br>
COMES AND GOES.<br>

THEN THIS HAPPINESS
IS A KIND OF HAPPINESS<br>
NO ONE REALLY KNOWS.<br>

## GIORGIO:
I THOUGHT I KNEW WHAT LOVE WAS.


<div class="fragment">

## CLARA:
I’D ONLY HEARD WHAT LOVE WAS.

I THOUGHT IT WAS NO MORE THAN A NAME<br>
FOR YEARNING.

I THOUGHT IT WAS WHAT KINDNESS BECAME.

I’M LEARNING—

ENDLESS HAPPINESS…

What?


## GIORGIO:
Not now…


## CLARA:
Tell me… please.

---



---


## GIORGIO:
I received my orders from headquarters. I’ve been transferred to the Fourth Brigade.


## CLARA:
When?

---


## GIORGIO:
I leave in five days. 

---

Though we’ll be far apart, we will always have each other, Clara. Please try not to look so sad.

---


## CLARA:
You’re the one who makes me happy.

---


## GIORGIO:
Yes, well, we will make the most of the next four days. We’ll steal as much time as we can. 

---

And after I leave, we’ll write each other every day. We’ll make love with our words. 

---

You’ll be with me every day, Clara.

## CLARA:
I must go. I’m expected.

YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL.<br>
I LOVE TO SEE YOU IN THE LIGHT,<br>

<div class="fragment">

## COLONEL:
–Thank you, Lieutenant.

---


## DOCTOR:
How was the opera?

---




## TORASSO:
Terrible. These touring companies get no better.

---




## COOK:
And neither do you.

---




## TORASSO:
I sing to lighten the impact of your heavy cooking.

---




## BARRI:
Sergeant, what is this?

---




## COOK:
It’s veal.

---




## BARRI:
Veal? We had veal four days ago. And from the looks of it, it was this veal.

---


## COOK:
Lieutenant Barri, if I hear— 


<div class="fragment">

[offstage wails of pain]



</div>

---



## RIZZOLI:
Colonel, I’ve heard a rumor that the King is about to sign a treaty with the French.

---




## DOCTOR:
Really?

---




## COLONEL:
I’ve heard no such rumor, Major.

---




## DOCTOR:
Where did you receive this information?

---




## RIZZOLI:
In town.

---




## COLONEL:
You mustn’t believe everything you hear in a whorehouse, Major.

---


## RIZZOLI:
That is where Garibaldi received much of his information, sir.


<div class="fragment">

## DOCTOR:
Ah! So that’s why you go there!


</div>


---


## COLONEL:
Ah, Captain Bachetti. Welcome. We wondered when you were going to arrive. May I introduce you to Doctor Tambourri, Major Rizzoli…

---




## BARRI:
Lieutenant Barri.

---




## TORASSO:
Lieutenant Torasso.


---



## COOK:
Sergeant Lombardi.

---




## COLONEL:
Please! Join us.

---




## COOK:
You’ll have to excuse our limited menu, Captain. It’s difficult to cultivate fresh vegetables in this mountain soil.

---




## DOCTOR:
We are not only isolated from life and ideas here, Captain, but anything green and edible as well.

---




## RIZZOLI:
I just put vinegar on everything.

---




## TORASSO:
Captain Bachetti, the Colonel has told us of your triumphs pinning down the Russian infantry.

---




## GIORGIO:
I’m not sure my actions deserve your attention.

---




## TORASSO:
Didn’t you rescue a wounded man in the midst of fire and then carry him on your horse to camp?

---




## GIORGIO:
Only to our battalion.

---




## BARRI:
Say you brought him back to camp! Why settle for being half a hero when full-fledged is just a white lie away?

---




## CLARA:
“CLARA…

---


## GIORGIO:
“CLARA…<br>
I CRIED.


<div class="fragment">

## CLARA:
“I CRIED.

## CLARA & GIORGIO:
“IMAGINE THAT,<br>
A SOLDIER WHO CRIES.

---


## CLARA:
“I HAD TO HIDE MY EYES<br>
SO THE OTHERS ON THE TRAIN<br>

---

THAT CARRIED ME AWAY FROM YOU<br>
WOULD THINK I WAS ASLEEP.”

---


## GIORGIO:
Music?

---




## DOCTOR:
That’s Signora Fosca playing.

---




## COLONEL:
My cousin. <br>I have no family and neither does she. 

---

She is in such poor health, it’s a continual worry.

---




## DOCTOR:
That’s her place setting, but she stays in her room most days. Perhaps soon she’ll be well enough to join us for a meal.

---




## RIZZOLI:
She eats like a sparrow.

---




## TORASSO:
[laughing] My apologies, sir. The comparison struck me as funny. A sparrow seems to eat more than Signora Fosca. A pity it is…

---




## COLONEL:
My cousin loves to read— it’s her only passion, really. I can’t find enough books for her.

---




## GIORGIO:
Well, I also love to read. And I happen to have brought a few of my favorite books. 

---

I would be most happy to lend them to Signora Fosca, though I can’t promise they’ll appeal to her.

---




## COLONEL:
She’s been given to reading military handbooks. I have no doubt she will welcome anything in print!

---




## AUGENTI:
Mail!

---




## RIZZOLI:
Nothing for me again? It’s been two weeks.

---




## AUGENTI:
It smells to me as if Captain Bachetti has a letter from an admirer.

---




## CLARA:
“GIORGIO…<br>
I, TOO, HAVE CRIED<br>
INSIDE.

---




## CLARA, GIORGIO:
“YOU MUST NOT BE ASHAMED OF YOUR TEARS.

---




## CLARA:
“I LOVE YOU FOR YOUR TEARS.

---




## CLARA, GIORGIO:
YOUR ABSENCE ONLY MAKES MY LOVE GROW STRONGER.<br>
AND WHEN I CANNOT BEAR IT ANY LONGER …”

---




## BARRI:
Imagine surviving the battle of Alessandra only to lose your life to an aide-de-camp in a duel.

---


## TORASSO:
An aide-de-camp will do anything to—

[offstage wails of pain]



</div>

---


## COLONEL:
Do not be alarmed! It’s my cousin. I have grown so accustomed to her outbursts that I forget how unsettling they can be to a newcomer. 

---

My apologies for not warning you.

---




## DOCTOR:
A doctor is always expected to give some aid even when there is nothing one can possibly do.

---




## TORASSO:
Some more lamb, please.

---




## DOCTOR:
You’ve finally found some tarragon, haven’t you?

---




## COOK:
Yes.

[offstage wails of pain]

---




## COLONEL:
Doctor.

---




## DOCTOR:
Excuse me.

---




## BARRI:
Sergeant, are there any more carrots?

---




## COOK:
Seconds for you, Lieutenant? Can I take that as a compliment?

---




## BARRI:
No, Sergeant, my horses are hungry.

In time, Captain Bachetti, you too will get used to life among us.

## DOCTOR:
Good afternoon, Captain.

---




## GIORGIO:
Doctor.

---




## DOCTOR:
Your troops seem to be responding well under your command.

---




## GIORGIO:
Thank you.

---




## DOCTOR:
And how have you been enjoying our post, Captain?

---




## GIORGIO:
Well, I find everyone most hospitable.

---




## DOCTOR:
Good. Your company at meals has been a welcome change for me.

---




## GIORGIO:
Thank you.

---




## DOCTOR:
I trust the occasional outbursts from Colonel Ricci’s cousin have not unsettled you too greatly.

---




## GIORGIO:
What exactly is wrong with this woman?

---


## DOCTOR:
…She is a kind of medical phenomenon, a collection of many ills.

---




## GIORGIO:
And those cries?

---




## DOCTOR:
Those are hysterical convulsions.

---

One might say that her nerves are exposed, where ours are protected by a firm layer of skin.

---




## GIORGIO:
Is she in danger of succumbing to this disease?

---




## DOCTOR:
I don’t believe so. Her body is so weak that it doesn’t have the strength to produce a mortal disease.

---




## GIORGIO:
I don’t understand.

---




## DOCTOR:
The weak protect themselves. The defensive soldier often lives longer than the brave one.

---



---


## GIORGIO:
Is she young?

---


## DOCTOR:
Late twenties, I would venture.

---


## GIORGIO:
Pretty? 

---



---

You don’t suppose that she is the lover of the Colonel, do you?

---




## DOCTOR:
Captain Bachetti, it’s good to see that you enjoy an occasional bit of gossip. 

---

No need for discomfort, Captain. We’re all human. Your curiosity is understandable. 

---

No, I’m afraid Signora Fosca’s physical state prevents her from being anyone’s lover. Good day.

---


## GIORGIO:
“CLARA, DON’T FORGET ME.<br>
KEEP ME CLOSE TO YOU, CLARA…”

---


## RIZZOLI:
Late for breakfast, Captain.

---


## GIORGIO:
Yes, well, we had early morning exercises before the troops departed for their weekly maneuvers.

---


## BARRI:
You’re a better officer than I am. I let my sergeant handle the morning drill.

---


## COOK:
It seems Signora Fosca has disappointed us once again.


---

## RIZZOLI:
Why keep setting her place?

---

[bugle sounding]

---


## BARRI:
Captain Bachetti, I’m afraid we’re gonna have to leave you to dine alone this morning.

---


## GIORGIO:
Well, we still have dinner to share, gentlemen.

---


## RIZZOLI:
Indeed we do.

---


## BARRI:
Any chance we can engage you in a game of cards tonight, Captain?

---


## GIORGIO:
I’m afraid I’m not a gambling man.

---


## RIZZOLI:
The boredom here will make a gambler of you yet.

---


## BARRI:
Good day, Captain.

---


## GIORGIO:
Gentlemen.

## CLARA & GIORGIO:
“HOW COULD I FORGET YOU?

## CLARA:
“YESTERDAY I WALKED THROUGH THE PARK<br>
TO THE KNOLL WHERE WE MET.

“AFTERWARDS I SAT ON THE BENCH<br>
WHERE WE SAT ALL THAT SULTRY AFTERNOON.

“I THOUGHT ABOUT OUR ROOM,<br>
OUR LITTLE ROOM,<br>
WHERE WE WERE HAPPY,

“AND WHERE WE SHALL BE HAPPY AGAIN,<br>

## FOSCA:
I hope I didn’t startle you.

## GIORGIO:
Signora Ricci, I’m Captain Bachetti— 


<div class="fragment">

## FOSCA:
–Bachetti. I know. <br>
My cousin has told me all about you.

</div>


---

I CAME TO THANK YOU FOR THE BOOKS.<br>
I WOULD HAVE SOONER, BUT I’VE BEEN SO ILL.

---


## GIORGIO:
Well, now you seem to be feeling more normal.

---


## FOSCA:
Normal? I hardly think so. 

---

Sickness is normal to me, as health is to you. 

---

Excuse me. I shouldn’t speak of my troubles. I have been going through a period of deep melancholy. 

---



---

I so enjoyed the novel by Rousseau.

---




## GIORGIO:
Oh, yes! It’s wonderful. My favorite, really.

---




## FOSCA:
The character of Julie is a great mystery.

---




## GIORGIO:
You should have kept the book a while longer to meditate over.

---




## FOSCA:
I DO NOT READ TO THINK.<br>
I DO NOT READ TO LEARN.<br>
I DO NOT READ TO SEARCH FOR TRUTH,

---

I KNOW THE TRUTH.<br>
THE TRUTH IS HARDLY WHAT I NEED.<br>
I READ TO DREAM.

---

I READ TO LIVE<br>
IN OTHER PEOPLE’S LIVES.

---

I READ ABOUT THE JOYS THE WORLD<br>
DISPENSES TO THE FORTUNATE,<br>
AND LISTEN FOR THE ECHOES.<br>

---

I READ TO LIVE, <br>
TO GET AWAY FROM LIFE!

---


NO, CAPTAIN, I HAVE NO ILLUSIONS.<br>
I RECOGNIZE THE LIMITS OF MY DREAMS.

---

I KNOW HOW PAINFUL DREAMS CAN BE<br>
UNLESS YOU KNOW<br>
THEY’RE MERELY DREAMS.

---

THERE IS A FLOWER<br>
WHICH OFFERS NECTAR AT THE TOP, 

---

DELICIOUS NECTAR AT THE TOP,<br>
AND BITTER POISON UNDERNEATH.

---

THE BUTTERFLY THAT STAYS TOO LONG<br>
AND DRINKS TOO DEEP<br>
IS DOOMED TO DIE.

---

I READ TO FLY,<br>
TO SKIM— <br>
I DO NOT READ TO SWIM.

---

I DO NOT DWELL ON DREAMS.<br>
I KNOW HOW SOON A DREAM BECOMES AN EXPECTATION.

---

HOW CAN I HAVE EXPECTATIONS?<br>
LOOK AT ME.

---

NO, CAPTAIN, LOOK AT ME— <br>
LOOK AT ME!

---

I DO NOT WANT FOR WHAT I CANNOT HAVE!<br>
I DO NOT CLING TO THINGS I CANNOT KEEP!

---

THE MORE YOU CLING TO THINGS,<br>
THE MORE YOU LOVE THEM,

---

THE MORE THE PAIN YOU SUFFER<br>
WHEN THEY’RE TAKEN FROM YOU…

---

AH, BUT IF YOU HAVE NO EXPECTATIONS,<br>
CAPTAIN,<br>
YOU CAN NEVER HAVE A DISAPPOINTMENT.

---




## FOSCA:
I must be mad to chatter on about myself like this to you. Forgive me…

---



## GIORGIO:	
I assure you— 

---




## FOSCA:
No, forgive me, please…

---



## GIORGIO:	
But truly, signora, there is nothing to forgive. 

---




## FOSCA:
HAVE YOU EXPLORED THE TOWN?<br>
IT IS REMOTE, ISN’T IT?

---

AND PROVINCIAL, DON’T YOU THINK?


<div class="fragment">

## GIORGIO:
Yes.

THE STREETS, THE FIELDS,<br>

You do like gardens, I hope?

---




## GIORGIO:
Yes.

---




## FOSCA:
GOOD, I CAN SHOW YOU GARDENS.<br>
AND THEN OF COURSE THERE IS THE CASTLE.
The ruined castle.

---




## GIORGIO:
Ah.

---




## FOSCA:
I find it lovely. Probably because it’s ruined, I suppose.

---




## GIORGIO:
I didn’t know there was a castle.

---




## FOSCA:
I LIKE TO TAKE EXCURSIONS THERE— <br>
WHEN I’M IN BETTER HEALTH.

---

PERHAPS YOU’LL JOIN ME<br>
AND MY COUSIN<br>
ONE DAY…


## GIORGIO:
Well, that would be delightful. I don’t believe I’ve seen a flower or a garden since the day I arrived.


---



---

[funeral drumming]

---



## GIORGIO:
How very kind.

---




## FOSCA:
I’m surprised you haven’t noticed our wonderful greenhouse.

---




## GIORGIO:
Greenhouse?

---




## FOSCA:
They’ve had no luck with vegetables, but the gardenias and petunias are magnificent.

---




## GIORGIO:
And to think how many times I’ve passed that building and never taken notice.

---




## GIORGIO:
Look. There’s a hearse drawing up— it must be for flowers to adorn the casket. 

---

It’s good to know that the dead here can go to their graves— <br>

## GIORGIO:
HOW CAN I DESCRIBE HER?<br>
THE WRETCHEDNESS,<br>
GOD, THE WRETCHEDNESS

Look at how they’ve let this garden go.

I think it’s rather beautiful.

## COLONEL:
Doctor Tambourri, may I have a word with you?

## DOCTOR:
Certainly.

## COLONEL:
Captain Bachetti, would you lend my cousin your arm?

---




## GIORGIO:
Of course.

## COLONEL:
We’ll catch up with you in a moment.

I know how to walk. My cousin likes to treat me like a child.

ALL I KNEW,<br>
ALL THAT I COULD THINK OF WAS YOU.”

I felt no different.

## CLARA:
“SO UNBEAUTIFUL—

## FOSCA:
Pity is nothing but passive love.

Dead love.

TO FEEL A WOMAN’S TOUCH…”


<div class="fragment">

## GIORGIO:
These thoughts are bad for you. 


</div>

---

You must concentrate on everything around you that suggests beauty and life. These trees, the flowers, the warm smell of the air— 

---




## FOSCA:
You make it sound so simple, Captain. As if a flower or a tree could somehow make one happy.

---




## CLARA:
“PERHAPS IT WAS THE DRESS,<br>
THE FRAGRANCE OF HER DRESS,<br>
THE LIGHT PERFUME OF SILK

THAT’S WARM FROM BEING IN THE SUN,<br>

THE FRAGRANCE OF A WOMAN…”

## GIORGIO:
There is no absolute happiness in anyone’s life, Signora. The only happiness we can be certain of is love.

---




## FOSCA:
What do you mean?

---




## CLARA:
“THE GARDEN FILLED WITH YOU—” 

---




## FOSCA:
Are you speaking of family or friendships?

I’m speaking of a superior kind of love—

“—AND ALL THAT I COULD DO—”

—the kind between two people.

“—BECAUSE OF YOU,<br>

Yes.

Yes, I’ve read about that love, but you speak of it as one who lives it.

I’m not feeling well. I must go back.


## GIORGIO:
I’m sorry, signora.

## FOSCA:
You can be incredibly cruel, Captain.

## GIORGIO:
Cruel?

---




## FOSCA:
TO SPEAK TO ME OF LOVE—

Oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to speak—

“BEAUTIFUL,”<br>

YOUR SENSITIVITY,

THE OTHERS— WELL, <br>
THEY’RE ALL ALIKE,

STUPIDITY IS THEIR EXCUSE,<br>
AS UGLINESS IS MINE,

BUT WHAT IS YOURS?

I WATCHED YOU FROM MY WINDOW.<br>
I SAW YOU ON THE DAY THAT YOU ARRIVED.

PERHAPS IT WAS THE WAY YOU WALKED,<br>
THE WAY YOU SPOKE TO YOUR MEN.

---

I SAW THAT YOU WERE DIFFERENT THEN.<br>
I SAW THAT YOU WERE KIND AND GOOD.

---

I THOUGHT YOU UNDERSTOOD.

---

THEY HEAR DRUMS,<br>
YOU HEAR MUSIC,

---	

AS DO I.<br>
DON’T YOU SEE?

---

WE’RE THE SAME,<br>
WE ARE DIFFERENT,

---

YOU AND I ARE DIFFERENT.<br>
THEY HEAR ONLY DRUMS

---

ALL THE TIME I WATCHED FROM MY ROOM,<br>
I WOULD <br>
THINK OF COMING DOWNSTAIRS,

THINKING WE’D MEET, <br>
THINKING YOU’D LOOK AT ME, <br>
THINKING YOU’D BE REPELLED BY WHAT YOU SAW.

DON’T REJECT ME.<br>
DON’T DENY ME, CAPTAIN.<br>
UNDERSTAND ME, BE MY FRIEND.

THEY HEAR DRUMS,<br>
WE HEAR MUSIC.

BE MY FRIEND…

## GIORGIO:
Yes. Of course. You have my friendship.

---




## FOSCA:
Thank you, Captain.

---




## GIORGIO:
Your hand is on fire.

---




## FOSCA:
It’s nothing. I have a fever.

---




## COLONEL:
Shall we make our way towards the castle?

---




## GIORGIO:
Signora Fosca is not feeling well.

---




## COLONEL:
I’m terribly sorry, my dear.

---




## FOSCA:
I’ll be fine now.

---




## COLONEL:
Of course, but we should head back nonetheless.

---




## CLARA:
My darling, you did as you should. You had no choice.

---




## GIORGIO:
After all, her cousin is my superior.

---




## CLARA:
You must think of your career.

---




## GIORGIO:
How could I turn from such a desperate soul?

---




## CLARA:
You showed pity.

---




## GIORGIO:
And yet I have a sinking feeling.

---




## CLARA:
It is difficult for a man and a woman to be friends.

---




## GIORGIO:
I sense that she needs more.

---




## CLARA:
You must be careful to keep your intentions clear.

---




## GIORGIO:
I’ve opened the door.

---




## CLARA:
Desperation can take its toll.

## FOSCA:
THREE DAYS…

## GIORGIO:
Should I be cruel to keep myself free?

There is nothing wrong with thinking of oneself.

## FOSCA:
THREE DAYS…

## GIORGIO:
All I think of is you.

## CLARA:
Keep your distance.

## GIORGIO:
Yes, keep my distance.

Make yourself scarce.

[military snare drumming]

## FOSCA:
“Giorgio, these past three days have been perhaps the most painful of my life. I’ve looked for you everywhere. 

---

No matter how poor my health, I’ve made my way to the dining hall, praying you would be there. 

---

You promised me your friendship, Giorgio, but it’s clear to me that that promise was a hollow one. 

---

I so looked forward to your company. Didn’t you know how your absence would upset me? 

---

I want to strike you from my mind and my heart, but I can’t, Giorgio. You may disappear, but I will not.”

---




## BARRI:
…I applied for a new pair of horses, but they only had bays or piebalds.

---




## COOK:
Piebalds!

---




## TORASSO:
You certainly don’t want piebalds.

---




## RIZZOLI:
Perhaps you should go to Turin. There is a wonderful stable there— 

---




## BARRI:
No, that stable’s no longer reputable.

---




## TORASSO:
Ah, Bachetti…

---




## COLONEL:
We haven’t seen you in three days, Captain.

---




## GIORGIO:
Yes, well, I decided to accompany my troops on maneuvers.

---




## BARRI:
Your hard work’s determined to give us all a bad name.

---




## GIORGIO:
Oh, no, nonsense. 

---



---

Excuse me, Doctor. Why do you always put that gold coin on the table?


## DOCTOR:
For thirty years, I’ve done that whenever I eat with other officers. 

---

The first meal where no one talks about horses or women, 


---

<!-- .slide: class="col2" -->
## DOCTOR
I’ll surrender my gold coin.

## ALL
“Surrender my gold coin.”

---


## BARRI:
Oooh, some risk! You’ll never lose it!

---




## RIZZOLI:
I remember a wager that Lieutenant Barri made once… 

---


## FOSCA:
I’ve missed you so.


<div class="fragment">

## GIORGIO:
Please.


</div>


---


## FOSCA:
You must read my letter.


<div class="fragment">

## GIORGIO:
Let go of my hand! Let go!

---


## RIZZOLI:
…Well, of course there was no chance for anyone but him to win.

---




## BARRI:
No one forced you to bet, Major.

---




## DOCTOR:
Please pass the salt. 

---

Not hungry, Captain?

---




## GIORGIO:
Yes? Yes. Colonel, I’ve received a letter today. I’m needed urgently in Milan. I request a leave of at least five days.

---




## DOCTOR:
What?

---




## COLONEL:
If you had asked me this in my office, I might have refused. After all, you have only been here a month…

---




## GIORGIO:
Yes, well, it’s of some importance, sir.

---




## COLONEL:
I should hope so. When do you wish to leave?

---




## GIORGIO:
First thing tomorrow.

---




## COLONEL:
Very well. At this table, who could say no to a guest?

---




## TORASSO:
By this time tomorrow, you’ll probably be in the arms of some young beauty.

When will you be back?

You know I have a five-day leave.

Will you think of me when you’re gone?

## GIORGIO:
Thinking of my work, and my superiors, of your cousin, I will no doubt also think of… you. Please, Signora.

Do not be difficult. Please! You must stop this behavior immediately.

## FOSCA :
[shouting]
What does it matter if people see me?!

What do I care if the world knows how I feel? I adore you! Is that something I should be ashamed of?

Is that something I should hide? I’m no fool. I know you don’t feel the same way towards me.

But one loves an animal, a dog.

What can I do to get you to love me— a human being like yourself?

## GIORGIO:
Please, Signora. Get up, I beg you. Signora!
Compose yourself. Calm down.

You see that I must leave right away. Yes, I am touched by your affection.

It flatters me, greatly. My mind races with a thousand thoughts.

Tell me your thoughts.

Really, I must go.

Yes, I promise.

Mortified?

Over everything that’s happened. My emotions sometimes overpower my judgment.

## GIORGIO:
Well. I found your affection very flattering.

## FOSCA:
How indulgent you are with me. 

---



---

Did you amuse yourself in Milan?

---




## GIORGIO:
Very much.

---




## FOSCA:
Admit that you only took leave to visit my rival.

---




## GIORGIO:
Your rival? Yes, that was the purpose of my visit.

---




## FOSCA:
Excuse me. I can be so naïve in respect to you. I should have known what you meant by the “urgent need” that required your leave. 

---

And will you go back soon?

---




## GIORGIO:
Whenever I can. As soon as possible.

---




## FOSCA:
If you get another leave.

---




## GIORGIO:
Naturally.

---




## FOSCA:
Perhaps I should put in a word with my cousin. Help from me might serve you well. 

---

It all depends on him. Of course, a negative word…

---




## GIORGIO:
Place more value on your dignity, Signora. Do not offend your own pride.

---




## FOSCA:
We each deal with our pride as best we can, Captain. You love this woman very much?

---




## GIORGIO:
I wrote you…

---




## FOSCA:
Is she beautiful?

---




## GIORGIO:
An angel.

---




## FOSCA:
Then why don’t you marry her?

---


## GIORGIO:
She is already married.

---




## FOSCA:
[gasps]
And you respect her?

---




## GIORGIO:
Respect has everything to do with love.

---




## FOSCA:
Oh, well, that’s not true. But it hardly matters. 

---

And is your angel also a mother?

---




## GIORGIO:
Let’s stop torturing each other. It’s humiliating and it’s unworthy of us and I find your sarcasm most distasteful.

---




## FOSCA:
Oh, I have many flaws, Captain.

---




## GIORGIO:
Our situation has been well-defined, so let’s not speak of it again.

---




## FOSCA:
Yes, that is what I would like.

---




## GIORGIO:
Good. 

---




## FOSCA:
And you can also hope that we will not see each other again.

---




## GIORGIO:
That may be the best course of action.

You may go now, Captain. I have more important things to do.

“My darling— The last three weeks have been a blessing. Signora Fosca has all but disappeared from my life here. 

---

She no longer has her meals with us or takes the occasional walk around the grounds. 

---

Even in her absence, I found myself hating her more and more. 

---

I’ve realized how I’ve had to temper my feelings toward her. But, now that I’m free, I can feel as I please.

## DOCTOR:
Thank you for coming at this hour, Captain.

---




## GIORGIO:
Yes, of course.

---




## DOCTOR:
Signora Fosca has taken a turn for the worse. She is mortally ill.

---




## GIORGIO:
I’m sorry to hear that.

---




## DOCTOR:
[scoffing] Don’t you understand, my boy? It is because of you.

---




## GIORGIO:
Because of me?

---




## DOCTOR:
She told me everything. This was a confidence she made spontaneously, of course. 

---

You rejected her love— which doesn’t surprise me— and now this refusal has increased the gravity of her disease. 

---

This woman is letting herself die because of you.

---




## GIORGIO:
Because of me? She is letting herself die? Then it is not a disease, is it Doctor?

---




## DOCTOR:
She has an incurable disease, but if she is calm, if she takes care of herself, she could live for several years. 

---

This passion that has developed for you— 

---




## GIORGIO:
Passion for me—Doctor! I hardly know this woman! She has—she has thrown herself at me without cause.

---




## DOCTOR:
She does not think or act as we do, Captain. As healthy people we cannot appreciate the psyche of the sick.

---




## GIORGIO:
Yes. Yes, well. 

---

I am sure that you will do everything you can to help her.

---




## DOCTOR:
A simple act on your part is all that is asked for.

---


## GIORGIO:
I don’t wish to get involved.


<div class="fragment">

## DOCTOR:
You are involved, sir. 


</div>


---

Go see her.

---




## GIORGIO:
No.

---




## DOCTOR:
You, who saved a man in combat, must understand the need to save another’s life when it is in jeopardy.

---




## GIORGIO:
Well I couldn’t possibly visit Signora Fosca at her sick bed, that would be improper. And the Colonel would never allow it.

---




## DOCTOR:
Oh, you needn’t worry. I’ve made all the arrangements.

---




## GIORGIO:
So she knows of this business?

---




## DOCTOR:
You cannot imagine what this has cost her. 

---

You are a good-looking young man. Beauty is something one pays for, the same as goodness— another quality you embody. 

---

Please, go to her now.

---




## GIORGIO:
And if I go to her tonight, what will she ask of me tomorrow? Or next week? 

---

You speak of what her feelings have cost her— well what have they cost me?

---




## DOCTOR:
I can imagine how difficult this is for you but she is dying, and you have only to give her words. Words that will make her well. 

---

What is the cost of a few words when a life hangs in the balance?

---



---


## GIORGIO:
No need to be frightened. It is Giorgio.


## FOSCA:
Oh my God! 

---

My God! I never thought you would come. Of course I hoped… 

---


I’m sorry. These are the follies one commits before dying.


## GIORGIO:
Don’t speak of dying, Signora.

---




## FOSCA:
Now that you’re here, I won’t. Will you forgive me for having asked you to come?

---




## GIORGIO:
I am here because I chose to be.

---




## FOSCA:
Sit down. 

---

No. 

---

Sit here. Please. 

---

Rest your feet on the bed.

---

I want you to be comfortable. Please.

---



GOD, YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL.

---

COME, LET ME SEE YOU IN THE LIGHT.

---

NO, DON’T LOOK AT ME.
LET ME LOOK AT YOU.

---

I FEEL BETTER IN THE DARK.


## GIORGIO:
Your kindness makes you beautiful.

---




## FOSCA:
And do you value such beauty?

---




## GIORGIO:
I do.

---




## FOSCA:
Do you think my heart is good?

---




## GIORGIO:
Of course.

---




## FOSCA:
And how do the good hearts beat? Can you distinguish them from the bad? 

---

Listen to mine. 

---



---

My heart says it loves you, Giorgio. What does yours say?

---




## GIORGIO:
It says it loves you, Fosca.

---




## FOSCA:
As a…friend, or…?

---



---


## GIORGIO:
Tonight it loves you as you wish.

---




## FOSCA:
Thank you, Giorgio. I so wanted to forget you. To think that I could! I wanted to die without seeing you— 

---




## GIORGIO:
Well, I am here to tell you you would be happier living.

---

<!-- .slide: class="col2" -->

## FOSCA:
That day I was so awful to you— 


## GIORGIO:
No, let’s not speak of the past. 

---

You are tired. I have come, we have spoken, and now you must sleep.

---




## FOSCA:
Will you stay if I do?

---




## GIORGIO:
For a short while.

---




## FOSCA:
Will you sleep, too?

---




## GIORGIO:
If I can…

---




## FOSCA:
Lay your head near mine. 

---

Can we dream together?


## GIORGIO:
Yes.


## CLARA:
“My dearest Giorgio. 

---

It is three in the morning and I have just arisen from a dream of you. A dream so real I could swear you were there at my side. 

---

I am used to this, having you in my dreams night after night. 

---

As I write this, you are asleep. 

---

Do you dream of me? How I wish I could just lie by your side and watch you sleep.

To see you disarmed, at peace. Sometimes I think that when you watch a person sleep there’s a transparency that lets you see their soul. 

---

How I long to see yours…”

---




## FOSCA:
It is you. I thought I was dreaming. 

---

Draw the curtains, please. I want to see the stars before the daylight takes them away. 

---



---

Do you think there are other worlds out there?

---




## GIORGIO:
I do.

---




## FOSCA:
Will we ever visit them one day?

---




## GIORGIO:
I certainly hope so. 

---

As a child I used to dream that I could, um, fly— travel to far away places.

---




## FOSCA:
What is a man like you doing in the army, Giorgio?

---




## GIORGIO:
My father. My father was an officer. And it was expected that I would follow his path.

---




## FOSCA:
Call me by my name.

---




## GIORGIO:
Fosca.

---




## FOSCA:
Say “Giorgio and Fosca.”

---




## GIORGIO:
“Giorgio and Fosca.”

---




## FOSCA:
“Fosca and Giorgio.”

---




## GIORGIO:
“Fosca and Giorgio.”

---




## FOSCA:
What music! 

---

You love this woman very much?

---



---


## GIORGIO:
Don’t ask me that. I’ve told you that.


## FOSCA:
What is her name?

---



---


## GIORGIO:
Clara.

---




## FOSCA:
Clara.

---




## GIORGIO:
It’s getting light out. I should be going.

---




## FOSCA:
Will you do me a great favor before you go? Will you write a letter for me?

---




## GIORGIO:
Certainly.

---




## FOSCA:
There is paper in my desk.

---



---


## GIORGIO:
Yes?


## FOSCA:
My dearest… Fosca. 

---

Please.

---




## GIORGIO:
“My dearest Fosca.”

---




## FOSCA:
I WISH I COULD FORGET YOU,<br>
ERASE YOU FROM MY MIND.

---

BUT EVER SINCE I MET YOU,  I FIND<br>
I CANNOT LEAVE THE THOUGHT OF YOU BEHIND.

---

THAT DOESN’T MEAN I LOVE YOU…

---




## GIORGIO:
THAT DOESN’T MEAN I LOVE YOU…

---




## FOSCA:
I WISH THAT I COULD LOVE YOU…<br>
Please…

---

I KNOW THAT I’VE UPSET YOU.<br>
I KNOW I’VE BEEN UNKIND.

---

I WANTED YOU TO VANISH FROM SIGHT,<br>
BUT NOW I SEE YOU IN A DIFFERENT LIGHT.

---

AND THOUGH I CANNOT LOVE YOU,<br>
I WISH THAT I COULD LOVE YOU.

---

FOR NOW I’M SEEING LOVE<br>
LIKE NONE I’VE EVER KNOWN,

---

A LOVE AS PURE AS BREATH,<br>
AS PERMANENT AS DEATH,<br>
IMPLACABLE AS STONE.

---

A LOVE THAT, LIKE A KNIFE,<br>
HAS CUT INTO A LIFE<br>
I WANTED LEFT ALONE.

---

A LOVE I MAY REGRET,<br>
BUT ONE I CAN’T FORGET.

---

I DON’T KNOW HOW I LET YOU<br>
SO FAR INSIDE MY MIND,

---

BUT THERE YOU ARE AND THERE YOU WILL STAY.<br>
HOW COULD I EVER WISH YOU AWAY?<br>
I SEE NOW I WAS BLIND.

---

AND SHOULD YOU DIE TOMORROW,<br>
ANOTHER THING I SEE:

---

YOUR LOVE WILL LIVE IN ME.

---

I remain always… <br>
Your Giorgio. 

---

Please bring it to me, please. 

---



---

Thank you, Giorgio. 

---

Do you have sisters?

---




## GIORGIO:
I do.

---




## FOSCA:
Do you kiss them goodbye?

---




## GIORGIO:
On occasion.

---




## FOSCA:
Kiss me goodbye the way you do them. 

---



---

No, like you kiss her.

---



Now go. Thank you, Giorgio. 

---

Quickly. Run! 

---

[wailing in pain]

---


## SOLDIERS:
HOW CAN I DESCRIBE HER?<br>
THE WRETCHEDNESS,<br>
GOD, THE WRETCHEDNESS

---

AND THE SUFFERING, THE DESPERATION<br>
OF THAT POOR, UNHAPPY CREATURE— <br>
THE EMBARRASSMENT…

---



---


## TORASSO:
DID YOU HEAR THAT SCREAM LAST NIGHT?

---




## AUGENTI:
DID ANYBODY NOT?

---




## RIZZOLI:
Four-ball in the side.

---




## COOK:
SHE KNOWS HOW TO SCREAM, ALL RIGHT.

---




## BARRI:
WELL, SHE PRACTICES A LOT.

---




## AUGENTI:
Good shot.

---




## RIZZOLI:
Six-ball in the corner.

---




## COOK:
SO THAT WASN’T DYING, WE ASSUME.

---




## BARRI:
NO, I THINK SHE JUST FELL OFF HER BROOM.

---




## TORASSO:
OR THEY HUNG A MIRROR IN THE ROOM
OF LA SIGNORA!

---


## COOK, BARRI:
LA SIGNORA!


<div class="fragment">

## AUGENTI:
LA SIGNORA!


</div>

---


## RIZZOLI:
Please, a little quiet!

---




## GIORGIO:
Doctor.

---




## DOCTOR:
Captain.

---




## GIORGIO:
Was it absolutely necessary for me to go to her last night?

---




## DOCTOR:
Why else would I have asked you to go? I’m not some kind of procurer, Captain.

---




## GIORGIO:
Well, she hardly seemed near death!

---




## DOCTOR:
I’m sure she summoned her strength for you. Her condition was precarious before you arrived. 

---

You have done her a great service. You have done a brave thing. Now it is over. Good day.

---



---


## RIZZOLI:
Care to play, Captain?

---




## GIORGIO:
No! <br>
Thank you for asking.

---



---


## TORASSO:
JUST A BIT ALOOF, DON’T YOU THINK?

---

## COOK:
NOT AROUND THE COLONEL.


<div class="fragment">

## RIZZOLI:
GENTLEMEN, GENTLEMEN…


</div>

---


## AUGENTI:
NEVER TRUST A MAN WHO DOESN’T DRINK.

---


## TORASSO:
AND HE KEEPS A JOURNAL.


<div class="fragment">

## BARRI:
Eight-ball off the nine.


</div>

---


## RIZZOLI:
MAYBE, THOUGH, HE JUST PREFERS HIS BOOKS.

---




## COOK:
NOT AS MUCH AS HE PREFERS HIS LOOKS.

---




## TORASSO:
WHICH IS WHY HE THINKS HE’S GOT HIS HOOKS<br>
INTO LA SIGNORA— 

---




## BARRI:
GENTLEMEN, I’LL MAKE A WAGER:<br>
COME THE SUMMER, HE’LL BE MAJOR— 

---




## RIZZOLI:
I’LL SAY!

---



## ALL (EXCEPT RIZZOLI):
I’ll say!


## ALL:
I’LL SAY!

---



---


## COLONEL:
Captain! 

---

I cannot thank you enough. Your kindnesses to my cousin have meant a great deal.

---




## GIORGIO:
You have no reason to thank me.

---




## COLONEL:
Any attention that is paid to her means so much. Signora Fosca has always had a…shortage of friends.

---




## FOSCA:
“My dear Giorgio. I am writing to you even though the Doctor has forbidden it. 

---

What a joy it is to have someone to whom I can tell my feelings, to share my past with.

---




## COLONEL:
I was a young man when my parents died and Fosca’s mother and father welcomed me into their house whenever I was on leave.

---

AS A CHILD— 


<div class="fragment">

## FOSCA:
AS A CHILD— 


</div>

---


## COLONEL:
SHE WAS LONELY— 

---


## FOSCA:
I WAS HAPPY— 

---


## COLONEL:
HER PARENTS DOTED ON HER— 

---


## FOSCA:
MY PARENTS DOTED ON ME— 

---


## FOSCA, COLONEL:
THEY SAID:


<div class="fragment">

## MOTHER, FATHER:
BEAUTIFUL.


</div>

---


## MOTHER:
SO SENSITIVE.


<div class="fragment">

## MOTHER, FATHER:
SO BEAUTIFUL.


</div>

---


## FOSCA:
THEY TOLD ME TO BE:

---


## MOTHER:
CAREFUL— 


<div class="fragment">

## COLONEL:
OF COURSE— 


</div>

---


## MOTHER:
—FOSCA.


<div class="fragment">

## COLONEL:
—TO THEM SHE WAS.


</div>

---


## FATHER:
A GIRL AS BEAUTIFUL AS YOU ARE<br>
HAS TO— 

---


## FOSCA:
AND SO— 


<div class="fragment">

## FATHER:
—BE CAREFUL.


</div>

---


## FOSCA:
—I THOUGHT<br>
THAT I WAS BEAUTIFUL.

---

<!-- .slide: class="col2" -->

## FOSCA:
AND THEN I REACHED THE AGE— 


## COLONEL:
AND THEN SHE REACHED THE AGE— 

---


## FOSCA, COLONEL:
—WHERE BEING BEAUTIFUL
BECOMES THE MOST IMPORTANT THING<br>
A WOMAN CAN BE.

---


## COLONEL:
AN UNATTRACTIVE MAN— 


<div class="fragment">

## FOSCA:
AS LONG AS YOU’RE A MAN,—


</div>

---

<!-- .slide: class="col2" -->

## FOSCA:
—YOU STILL HAVE OPPORTUNITIES.


## COLONEL:
—CAN STILL HAVE OPPORTUNITIES.

---


## MOTHER, FATHER:
BEAUTIFUL.


<div class="fragment">

## COLONEL, FOSCA:
WHEREAS, IF YOU’RE A WOMAN,


</div>

YOU EITHER ARE A DAUGHTER OR A WIFE.

---


## MOTHER, FATHER:
A WOMAN IS A FLOWER.

## COLONEL, FOSCA:
YOU MARRY— 


</div>

## FATHER:
—NOW YOU’RE SEVENTEEN.

## COLONEL:
—OR YOU’RE A DAUGHTER ALL YOUR LIFE.

---


## MOTHER, FATHER:
NOW IS THE HOUR…

---


## COLONEL:
I’D MET THIS NICE YOUNG MAN.

---


## FOSCA:
I’D SEEN THIS NICE YOUNG MAN— 


<div class="fragment">

## COLONEL:
HE’D INTRODUCED HIMSELF— 


</div>

---


## FOSCA:
—PASSING BY— 


<div class="fragment">

## COLONEL:
—AT MY CLUB.


</div>

---


## FOSCA:
—JUST BELOW MY WINDOW.


<div class="fragment">

## COLONEL:
SO— 


</div>

---


## FOSCA:
ONE DAY— 


<div class="fragment">

## COLONEL:
—ONE EVENING I INVITED HIM— 


</div>

---


## FOSCA:
—HE TIPPED HIS HAT TO ME. 


<div class="fragment">

## COLONEL:
—HOME.


</div>

---

Count Ludovic— 


## FOSCA:
I MUST ADMIT THAT I WAS FLATTERED— 


## COLONEL:
—this is my Aunt Theresa and my Uncle Bruno.


## MOTHER:
A count?


## FATHER:
From where, if I may ask.


## LUDOVIC:
Austria.


## FATHER, MOTHER:
AUSTRIA…


## MOTHER:
What a beautiful place.


## COLONEL:
Fosca! We have a visitor!


## FOSCA:
IMAGINE MY SURPRISE…


## COLONEL:
I’d like you to meet a new friend. Count Ludovic.


## FOSCA:
He was even more handsome up close.


## COLONEL:
I was amazed to see him take such an interest in my cousin.

---


## LUDOVIC:
IF I HAD KNOWN YOU WERE HERE, SIGNORINA— 


<div class="fragment">

## FOSCA:
“If he had known…” Of course he knew.


</div>

---


## LUDOVIC:
—I WOULD HAVE BROUGHT YOU MANY FLOWERS.

---


## COLONEL:
If I had known…

---


## LUDOVIC:
YOU DO LIKE FLOWERS?

---


## FOSCA:
Yes.


<div class="fragment">

## COLONEL:
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.


</div>

---


## LUDOVIC:
I’VE SEEN YOU AT YOUR WINDOW.


## MOTHER:
Won’t you stay for dinner—?

---


## FATHER:
Do. Yes.


<div class="fragment">

## MOTHER:
…Count?


</div>

---


## LUDOVIC:
I’VE WATCHED YOU EVERY DAY SINCE I ARRIVED.

---


## FOSCA:
I HAD MY SUSPICIONS.


<div class="fragment">

## COLONEL:
I HAD NO SUSPICION.


</div>

---


## FOSCA, COLONEL:
I CHOSE NOT TO SEE.


<div class="fragment">

## LUDOVIC:
THE WAY YOU MOVE,<br>
THE WAY YOU GAZE AT THE SKY…

</div>


---


## FOSCA:
FOR LOVE HAD MADE ME BLIND— 


<div class="fragment">

## COLONEL:
HOW COULD I BE SO BLIND?


</div>

---


## FOSCA:
—OR WHAT I TOOK FOR LOVE.

---




## COLONEL:
Within a month, he had asked for her hand.

---




## GIORGIO:
Signora Fosca has been married?

---




## COLONEL:
Yes.


---



## FATHER, MOTHER:
AUSTRIA…<br>
COUNT LUDOVIC OF AUSTRIA…

---




## FOSCA:
I SENSED IN HIM A DANGER,<br>
DECEPTION,<br>
EVEN VIOLENCE.

---

I MUST ADMIT TO SOME DEGREE<br>
THAT IT EXCITED ME.

---




## FATHER, MOTHER:
AUSTRIA…<br>
COUNT LUDOVIC OF AUSTRIA…

---




## COLONEL:
Once they were married, and once he’d received my uncle’s sizable dowry, he traveled a great deal and was unavailable to Fosca.

---




## FOSCA:
He gambled away the dowry.

---




## COLONEL:
It didn’t take him long to spend all of their money.

---




## FOSCA:
And so I was forced to go to my parents to borrow from what little savings they had left.

---




## COLONEL:
Then one day, when she was returning from market…

---




## MISTRESS:
Excuse me? You are the wife of a Count Ludovic?

---




## FOSCA:
Yes.

---




## MISTRESS:
YOU FOOL.<br>
THE MAN’S A FRAUD,<br>
A FAKE.

---

THE TRIPS HE SAID<br>
HE HAD TO TAKE<br>
ABROAD,

---

HE TOOK THEM SO THAT HE<br>
COULD BE<br>
WITH ME.

---

HE CALLS HIMSELF A COUNT,<br>
BUT HE’S NOT.<br>
HE’S NEVER HAD A TITLE IN HIS LIFE!

---

HE’S NEVER HAD A TITLE,<br>
BUT HE DOES HAVE A WIFE<br>
AND A CHILD IN DALMATIA.

---


## FOSCA:
I’m sorry, you must be mistaken.


<div class="fragment">

## MISTRESS:
Oh, yes!


</div>

---

HE ONLY WANTS TO BLEED YOU.<br>
UNTIL THE DAY HE DOESN’T NEED YOU.<br>
I WARN YOU HE’LL ABANDON YOU

---

AS HE ABANDONED HER<br>
AND ME, <br>
AND COUNTLESS OTHERS, I’VE NO DOUBT.

---

I’M TELLING YOU, THE MAN WAS BORN WITHOUT
A HEART.

---

YOU FOOL…


## FOSCA:
I confronted him with this information, and he made no attempt to deny it.

---



---


## LUDOVIC:
AH WELL, AT LAST YOU KNOW THE TRUTH,<br>
SIGNORINA.<br>
BUT YOU AS WELL MUST FACE THE TRUTH.

---

I’VE NO DESIRE TO DECEIVE YOU ANY MORE,<br>
BUT DO ADMIT WHAT YOU IGNORE:<br>
WE MADE A BARGAIN, DID WE NOT?

---

AND WE GOT<br>
WHAT WE BARGAINED FOR.

---

YOU GAVE ME YOUR MONEY, I GAVE YOU MY LOOKS<br>
AND MY CHARM.<br>
AND MY ARM.

---

I WOULD SAY THAT MORE THAN BALANCES THE BOOKS.<br>
WHERE’S THE HARM?<br>
NOW IT’S THROUGH.

---

IF WOMEN SELL THEIR LOOKS,<br>
WHY CAN’T A MAN?<br>
IF HE CAN?

---

BESIDES, THE MONEY WASN’T EVEN YOURS,<br>
IT BELONGED TO THOSE RIDICULOUS OLD BORES,<br>
YOUR PARENTS.

---

FORGIVE ME, MY DEAR,<br>
BUT THOUGH YOU ARE NO BEAUTY, I FEAR<br>
YOU ARE NOT QUITE THE VICTIM YOU APPEAR. 

---

WELL, LET US PART BY MUTUAL CONSENT<br>
AND BE CONTENT.

---

AND SO GOOD LUCK AND GOODBYE.<br>
I MUST GO.

---

OH, AND YES, WE HAVEN’T PAID THE RENT<br>
SINCE JULY<br>
JUST SO YOU KNOW…


## FOSCA:
I returned home, to find my parents impoverished and in poor health.


## COLONEL:
Fosca’s health failed…


## FOSCA:
A woman’s like a flower…


## COLONEL:
…and she began to suffer her first convulsions. My aunt and uncle nursed her as best they could.

---


## FOSCA:
A FLOWER’S ONLY PURPOSE IS TO PLEASE…


<div class="fragment">

## COLONEL:
I spent months looking for the man.


</div>

---


## FOSCA:
BEAUTY IS POWER…


<div class="fragment">

## COLONEL:
By then, of course, he’d vanished.


</div>

---


## FOSCA:
LONGING A DISEASE…


<div class="fragment">

## COLONEL:
To this day, I dream of finding him and realizing my revenge.


</div>

---


## FOSCA:
My father died not long thereafter.

---


## COLONEL:
HOW COULD I BE SO BLIND?


<div class="fragment">

## FOSCA:
I COULDN’T FACE THE WORLD.


</div>

---

<!-- .slide: class="col2" -->

## COLONEL:
IT TOOK HER MANY MONTHS TO LEAVE HER BED.


## FOSCA:
IT TOOK ME MONTHS TO LEAVE MY BED.

---


## COLONEL:
When her mother died, she had nothing really. No one.

---


## FOSCA:
And so I was forced to go to my cousin, who in some ways felt responsible for my circumstances.

---


## COLONEL:
WHY COULD I NOT ADMIT THE TRUTH?<br>
HOW COULD I NOT HAVE SEEN THROUGH THE VENEER?

---

I TOLD MYSELF, “AS LONG AS SHE SEEMS HAPPY,<br>
WHY INTERFERE?”

---

OR WAS I JUST RELIEVED TO KNOW<br>
THAT SOMEBODY WOULD WANT HER FOR A WIFE?

---

IN WAR YOU KNOW THE ENEMY,<br>
NOT ALWAYS SO IN LIFE.

---

THE ENEMY WAS LOVE— <br>
SELFISHNESS REALLY, BUT LOVE.

---

ALL OF US BLINDED BY LOVE<br>
THAT MAKES EVERYTHING SEEM POSSIBLE.

---

YOU HAVE TO PAY A CONSEQUENCE<br>
FOR THINGS THAT YOU’VE DENIED.<br>
THIS IS THE THORN IN MY SIDE.

---


## MISTRESS:
AS LONG AS YOU’RE A MAN,
YOU’RE WHAT THE WORLD WILL MAKE OF YOU.

---


## MISTRESS, MOTHER:
WHEREAS IF YOU’RE A WOMAN,
YOU’RE ONLY WHAT IT SEES.

---


## COLONEL, FATHER, LUDOVIC:
A WOMAN IS A FLOWER
WHOSE PURPOSE IS TO PLEASE.

---

## ALL (EXCEPT GIORGIO, FOSCA):
BEAUTY IS POWER,
LONGING A DISEASE…

[birds singing]

---


## FOSCA:
You came a great distance to read her letters. Are you running away from me? 

---

Since my recovery, you’ve made every effort to get away from me, to be free of my company.


<div class="fragment">

## GIORGIO:
There are times I wish to be left alone.


</div>

---


## FOSCA:
I know that I offend you.

---




## GIORGIO:
I won’t have this conversation.

---




## FOSCA:
[scoffing] 
And what conversation would you like to have, Captain? 

---

Would you like to discuss your troops? Or perhaps the weather? It looks like rain, don’t you think?

---




## GIORGIO:
I think you can be very difficult.

---




## FOSCA:
I didn’t come here to be difficult. I came here to simply share your company.

---




## GIORGIO:
What’s happened to your hands?

---




## FOSCA:
I must have fallen.

---




## GIORGIO:
You have no business being out here.

---

## FOSCA:
Do you want me dead?

---

## GIORGIO:
Fosca, don’t be so unfair.

---

## FOSCA:
I know, I’m unfair. I want to free you from my affection. I know what it is doing to you. 

---

---

Why is it that violets and daisies blossom now?

---

## GIORGIO:
They mistake Autumn’s warmth for April.

---



---


## FOSCA:
What is that bird that sings?

---



---


## GIORGIO:
A wren, I think.

---



## FOSCA:
What color is it?

---



## GIORGIO:
It’s grey and it’s the smallest of birds, I believe.

---


## FOSCA:
The smallest… You know so much. 

---

Give me a kiss. I know, I know a woman shouldn’t ask for such a thing. 

---

A woman shouldn’t have followed a man here. 

---

Given my appearance, I don’t behave as other women do. 

---

And so I ask you for a kiss. 

---

Then I’ll kiss you.

---


## GIORGIO:
IS THIS WHAT YOU CALL LOVE?

---

THIS ENDLESS AND INSATIABLE<br>
SMOTHERING PURSUIT OF ME,<br>
YOU THINK THAT THIS IS LOVE?

---

I’M SORRY THAT YOU’RE LONELY,<br>
I’M SORRY THAT YOU WANT ME AS YOU DO.

---

I’M SORRY THAT I FAIL TO FEEL<br>
THE WAY YOU WISH ME TO FEEL,

---

I’M SORRY THAT YOU’RE ILL,<br>
I’M SORRY YOU’RE IN PAIN,<br>
I’M SORRY THAT YOU AREN’T BEAUTIFUL.

---

BUT YES, I WISH YOU’D GO AWAY<br>
AND LEAVE ME ALONE!

---

EVERYWHERE I TURN,<br>
THERE YOU ARE.

---

THIS IS NOT LOVE,<br>
BUT SOME KIND OF OBSESSION.

---

WILL YOU NEVER LEARN<br>
WHEN TOO FAR IS TOO FAR,

---

HAVE YOU NO CONCERN<br>
FOR WHAT I FEEL,<br>
WHAT I WANT?

---

LOVE IS WHAT YOU EARN,<br>
AND RETURN,

---

WHEN YOU CARE FOR ANOTHER<br>
SO MUCH THAT THE OTHER’S <br>

## SET FREE:

---

DON’T YOU SEE?<br>
CAN’T YOU UNDERSTAND?

LOVE’S NOT A CONSTANT DEMAND,<br>
IT’S A GIFT YOU BESTOW.

LOVE ISN’T SUDDEN SURRENDER,<br>
IT’S TENDER AND SLOW.

IT MUST GROW.<br>
YET EVERYWHERE I GO,

---

YOU APPEAR,<br>
OR I KNOW<br>
YOU ARE NEAR.

THIS IS NOT LOVE,<br>
JUST A NEED FOR POSSESSION.

CALL IT WHAT YOU WILL,<br>
THIS IS NOT LOVE,

THIS IS THE REVERSE,<br>

SOMETHING OUT OF CONTROL.

I’VE BEGUN TO FEAR FOR MY SOUL…

It’s all right! It’s all right! Calm down.

She was—she was—she was dragging me down into the grave with her.

She was hugging me, kissing me with her cold lips. Her thin arms were like icy tentacles.

## DOCTOR:
It was only a dream.

---


## GIORGIO:
I’m so warm.

---


## DOCTOR:
You became ill after carrying Signora Fosca back in the rain.

---


## GIORGIO:
When was that?

---


## DOCTOR:
Two days ago.

---

You still have a fever, but it seems to be lower. 

---

My boy, you will recover from this illness, but it will take some time. 

---

You might as well enjoy it away from here. I am putting you on sick leave.

---


## GIORGIO:
Sick leave?

---


## DOCTOR:
This is a dreary place. It can get to us all. As soon as you are well enough, you will depart for Milan.

---


## GIORGIO:
Milan…

---


## DOCTOR:
Don’t look so sad, Captain. I trust there is someone there who can oversee your recuperation.

---


## SOLDIER:
TO FEEL A WOMAN’S TOUCH,<br>
TO TOUCH A WOMAN’S HAND,

---

REMINDED ME HOW MUCH I LONG TO BE WITH YOU,<br>
HOW LONG I’VE BEEN WITHOUT YOU NEAR.<br>
AND THEN TO HEAR A WOMAN’S VOICE,

---

TO HOLD A WOMAN’S ARM,<br>
TO FEEL A WOMAN’S TOUCH…

---



## CLARA:
“GIORGIO, DARLING,
FORTY DAYS’ LEAVE SO SOON!

---

“IMAGINE THAT,
A WHOLE FORTY DAYS— 

---

“WELL, FORTY MATINEES.

---

“I’LL BE THERE TO GREET THE TRAIN<br>
THAT CARRIED YOU AWAY FROM ME<br>
BECAUSE IT BRINGS YOU HOME.

---

I’M FILLING UP THE ROOM,<br>
OUR LITTLE ROOM,<br>
WITH EVERY FLOWER IN BLOOM.

---

I’LL HAVE THE FIRE LIT,<br>
THE TABLE SET,<br>
I’LL WEAR THE BLUE CHEMISE.

---

AND ONCE WE’RE IN OUR ROOM,<br>
OUR SECRET ROOM,<br>
WHERE I’LL BE ABLE TO CARE FOR YOU,

---

KISS YOU,<br>
EMBRACE YOU,<br>
BE THERE FOR YOU…

---

[train whistle blows]

---



---


## GIORGIO:
How could you? How dare you follow me?!

---


## FOSCA:
I’ve come to speak with you.

---


## GIORGIO:
I’m ill, don’t you understand? And you are the reason I am ill.

---


## FOSCA:
I apologize. Nothing could be further from what I wished for you. 

---

Which is why I followed you to Milan to see that you are well.

---


## GIORGIO:
That is the reasoning of a capricious child. You can’t do this!

---


## FOSCA:
I heard what you said, Giorgio, and I’ve come to tell you that… I will keep my distance. 

---

I will stay out of your path. I can be nearby, I can be quietly waiting.

---


## GIORGIO:
And this you think will make me love you?

---


## FOSCA:
No. 

---

No, I am doing this because I love you.

---


## GIORGIO:
Well.

---

My heart feels nothing for you. I don’t know how many times you need to hear that. 

---


## FOSCA:
This has nothing to do with your heart. This has to do with your eyes— what you see. 

---

If I were beautiful, if there were ample flesh on my bones, 

---

if my breasts were large and full, if I were soft and warm to your touch— 

---

you would feel otherwise.

---


## GIORGIO:
No, your appearance is no excuse for the way you behave. 

---

My feelings towards you are a result of your relentlessness, of your selfishness, and your constant insensitivity.

---


## FOSCA:
I’m sorry.

---

No one has taught me how to love. I know I feel too much. 

---

I don’t always know what to do with those feelings, Giorgio. 

---

You understand that, don’t you?


<div class="fragment">

## GIORGIO:
Fosca. You have to face the truth. Please. You have to give me up.


</div>


## FOSCA:
LOVING YOU<br>
IS NOT A CHOICE,<br>
IT’S WHO I AM.

---

LOVING YOU<br>
IS NOT A CHOICE

---

AND NOT MUCH REASON<br>
TO REJOICE,

---

BUT IT GIVES ME PURPOSE,<br>
GIVES ME VOICE,<br>
TO SAY TO THE WORLD:

---

THIS IS WHY I LIVE.<br>
YOU ARE WHY I LIVE.

---

LOVING YOU<br>
IS WHY I DO<br>
THE THINGS I DO.

---

LOVING YOU<br>
IS NOT IN MY <br>
CONTROL.

---

BUT LOVING YOU,<br>
I HAVE A GOAL<br>
FOR WHAT’S LEFT OF MY LIFE…

---

I WILL LIVE,<br>
AND I WOULD DIE<br>
FOR YOU.

---


## GIORGIO:
Die for me? What kind of love is that?

---


## FOSCA:
The truest love. 

---

Would Clara give her life for yours, Giorgio? I would. Happily.

---



In the end, you’ll finally see what is beautiful about me. 

---



---

Do you wish me to go to another compartment?


## GIORGIO:
We’re getting off at the next stop. I’m taking you back. 

---

You’re freezing. Cover yourself up. 

---



---

Do you wanna get sicker?

---



---


## FOSCA:
The moon makes even this landscape look lovely. Look. 

---

There seem to be faces in those rocks, smiling back at us.

---



## SOLDIER 1:
HOW LONG WERE WE APART…

---


## SOLDIER 2:
A MONTH, A WEEK, A DAY?

---


## SOLDIER 1:
TO FEEL YOUR TOUCH AGAIN…

---


## SOLDIER 2:
YOU’VE NEVER BEEN AWAY…

---



---


## DOCTOR:
Don’t be offended if I’m amused, Captain, but this is all quite bizarre. Really. 

---

She led you back like a lamb. 

---


## GIORGIO:
Yes, well, you know her, and you know there is no way I could have acted differently, so...

---


## DOCTOR:
You needn’t worry. No one knows of her exploits.

---


## GIORGIO:
I suppose I should be relieved, but in truth it matters little to me. And who told her I was leaving?

---


## DOCTOR:
I hardly thought it a secret.

---


## GIORGIO:
What is it that you want, Doctor?

---


## DOCTOR:
I don’t know what you mean.

---


## GIORGIO:
Yes you do. Why did you bring this woman into my life?

---


## DOCTOR:
I thought it would help her. I thought it might bring her some small degree of happiness… 

---

I had no intention for it to turn to this, Captain. Honestly, I didn’t. I apologize. 

---

She tells me that you’re going to Milan tomorrow, but for only four days.

---

I trust that is just a pretext and that you won’t be coming back?

---


## GIORGIO:
I don’t wish to be away from my duties for that long, so, if you’ll excuse me, I have things to do.

---


## DOCTOR:
Captain Bachetti, you forget that I am your superior. 

---

You can’t decide to forgo a sick leave just like that. Has Signora Fosca brought you to this?


---

## GIORGIO:
Absolutely not. This is my decision.

---


## DOCTOR:
Don’t you see what she is doing to you? To your mental state? 

---

I may have helped bring this woman into your life, but I can also help you get you away from her. For your own good. 

---

I can see to it that you are transferred permanently. 

---

If I send a dispatch to headquarters, you’ll be ordered to leave.

---


## GIORGIO:
I don’t wish to be transferred.

---


## DOCTOR:
Why are you behaving this way?

---


## GIORGIO:
I feel it my duty to help her.  

---


## DOCTOR:
Don’t you understand, Captain? No one can help her. Good day.   

---

GIORGIO,<br>
I DIDN’T TELL YOU IN MY LETTER<br>
SOMETHING EVEN BETTER,

A SURPRISE HERE AT HOME:<br>
IN A WEEK MY HUSBAND GOES TO ROME.<br>

---

IT’S THE FIRST TIME HE’S AWAY,<br>
HE’LL BE GONE AT LEAST A DAY,

---

MAYBE TWO OR EVEN THREE.<br>
I CAN VISIT YOU AT NIGHT,

---

WE’LL BE LIGHTED BY THE MOON,<br>
NOT A SHUTTERED AFTERNOON.

WOULDN’T THAT BE BEAUTIFUL—?


<div class="fragment">

## GIORGIO:
I’m not taking the sick leave. 


</div>

---


## CLARA:
What do you mean?

---




## GIORGIO:
I’m only staying four days.

---




## CLARA:
It’s that woman, isn’t it?

---


## GIORGIO:
There are many reasons— 

---


## CLARA:
No, you constantly write to me about her, speak of her when we’re together. 

---

She is always on your mind, Giorgio. 

---

Do you love her?

---


## GIORGIO:
The idea is laughable.

---


## CLARA:
I hate this woman, and I don’t even know her.

---


## GIORGIO:
There are times when I hate her, too.

---


## CLARA:
Then why do you sacrifice yourself on her behalf?

---


## GIORGIO:
I am not certain! Please do not be angry with me, Clara. 

---

This woman has no friends and she has no one to talk to. And I know the power that I have over her. 

---

I did not ask for this power, but it has been…bestowed upon me, and somehow it comes with… responsibilities that I can’t seem to shed.

---


## CLARA:
She needs you.

---


## GIORGIO:
Don’t you need me, too, Clara?

---


## CLARA:
Yes, of course, but not like this woman.

---


## GIORGIO:
Leave your husband.

---


## CLARA:
What?

---


## GIORGIO:
Let’s have a life together.

---


## CLARA:
Giorgio, you know that’s not possible.

---


## GIORGIO:
Anything is possible.

---


## CLARA:
I would lose my child.

---


## GIORGIO:
Well, what if you were to lose me?

---


## CLARA:
I don’t want to lose you, Giorgio. You knew my situation.

---


## GIORGIO:
You could run away and you could take your child.

---


## CLARA:
You’re not thinking clearly. You’re not yourself.

---


## GIORGIO:
I am myself!

---


## CLARA:
Where would we go? How would we live?

---


## GIORGIO:
We would manage.

---


## CLARA:
We are not two people who could ever just “manage.” 

---

We have to carve out a life for ourselves around our present obligations.

---

 We have no choice.

---


## GIORGIO:
We have a choice.

---


## CLARA:
Yes, I suppose that’s true, Giorgio. Just as you have chosen to forgo your sick leave. 

---



---

I’ve often wondered if you would love me as much if I were free.


## GIORGIO:
I would, Clara. You know I would.

---

I love you.

---


## CLARA:
And I love you. 

---

You’re not coming back, are you?


## GIORGIO:
I’ll be back. Clara! I’ll be back. Let’s stop this talk. Let’s enjoy the next four days together.

Salute!

When is dinner being served, Sergeant Lombardi?

---


## COOK:
The pheasants will be ready shortly.

---


## COLONEL:
Ah, the Christmas season is the most wonderful time of the year. Wouldn’t you agree, Doctor?

---


## DOCTOR:
I am not much of a believer, I must confess.

---


## COLONEL:
It is not the birth of Christ we’re celebrating tonight, Doctor. 

---

We are celebrating the joys of domestic life.

---


## COOK:
And the food!

---


## COLONEL:
All right, yes, the food. No, thank you. Oh, look who has arrived!

---


## DOCTOR:
Captain.

## COLONEL:
Thank you for coming, Captain. I am so happy that you did not take your leave!

Mail.

We’ve come to think of you as part of the family.

Yes, and I appreciate that.

At last, a letter for me.

Ugh. Excuse me.

You look very charming.

It’s alright, Captain. Read your letter. It’s fine.

## BARRI:
I can smell the perfume on Captain Bachetti’s letter from here, and a fragrant perfume it is! 

---

My correspondence smells like it came from a barn.

---


## COOK:
Dinner will be ready in ten minutes. I’ve just put in the truffles!

## RIZZOLI:
Truffles! Indeed, I can’t remember the last time I had truffles!

I hope they’ll be recognizable after Sergeant Lombardi…

Captain Bachetti!

Is it you or the gentlemen from the ministry who are responsible for this surprise?

## GIORGIO:
Excuse me?

You have been transferred back to headquarters. You are to report immediately.

## GIORGIO:
Immediately?

This is most unusual, Captain Bachetti.

But really, I don’t understand.

Giorgio! My love, don’t leave!

You will wait for me here, Captain Bachetti.

IS IT OVER FOREVER?

“It seems to me the answer rests with you.

“Yes, I have obligations at home, but my heart is yours.

Can we have back what we once had? I have to know. We both have to know.”

## COLONEL:
Signor Bachetti! I found this letter at my cousin's bedside. This is your signature, is it not?

---


## GIORGIO:
Yes, sir.

---


## COLONEL:
You have taken advantage of my cousin’s affections!

---


## GIORGIO:
That was not my intention, sir. Perhaps you should discuss this matter with Signora Fosca.

---


## COLONEL:
My cousin is asleep, and in any event, I wouldn’t subject her to such a question. 

---

No one can make me believe that a man such as yourself would desire a woman like Signora Fosca, would write her a letter like this.

---


## GIORGIO:
Why is that?

---


## COLONEL:
The reason seems obvious.

---


## GIORGIO:
Not to me. And forgive me for saying this, sir, but you had no right to read that letter— no right to take it from her room.

---


## COLONEL:
My cousin is at the end of her life. She does not deserve to be led on in such a manner!

---


## GIORGIO:
Well, you don’t know your cousin. She is not a child! And she is not just a sick person! 

---

Signora Fosca is as responsible for her actions as am I for mine.

---


## COLONEL:
You have abused my good faith, come into my house to dishonor it. 

---

Your attitude towards me is nothing short of contemptuous. 

---

I must demand a reparation from you, and mere words will not suffice.

---


## GIORGIO:
What? Fight? A duel?

---


## COLONEL:
I have confided in you. You know that my cousin has been taken advantage of before.

---

We will meet tomorrow morning at eight, behind the castle steps.

---


## DOCTOR:
Gentlemen, wait. Colonel, there is an explanation. Captain Bachetti, speak up. 

---

Say how she forced you— 

---


## GIORGIO:
Not at all. Nothing was forced on me.

---


## DOCTOR:
Please, let’s come to our senses here.

---


## COLONEL:
And one more thing.

---


## GIORGIO:
Yes, sir?

---


## COLONEL:
My cousin knows nothing of this discovery. She must know nothing of what is going to happen. 

---

I need your word on that.

---


## GIORGIO:
She will not hear of it from me.

---


## COLONEL:
Very well. Tomorrow.

---


## DOCTOR:
[shouting] It is deplorable that that woman has brought you to this!

---

[calmly] Let’s not panic. 

---

The Colonel will calm down. There’s still time to explain. 

---


## GIORGIO:
I wish to see Fosca.

---


## DOCTOR:
What?

---


## GIORGIO:
Whatever the outcome of this duel, I’ll never see her again, so arrange for me to meet her as you did last time.

---


## DOCTOR:
You don’t know what you’re saying.

---


## GIORGIO:
Doctor, you may have forgotten how to cure diseases, but you have induced mine, so please, do not pretend you don’t know what I say!

---


## DOCTOR:
You understand this woman could never be your lover. Her physical condition— 

---


## GIORGIO:
You will arrange for me to see her.

---


## DOCTOR:
No! I will not participate in this madness.

---



---


## GIORGIO:
Fosca? 

---

I wanted you to know that I had nothing to do with the transfer.

---


## FOSCA:
I know that now, the Doctor told me.

---


## GIORGIO:
And the letter from Clara…

---


## FOSCA:
Yes?

---


## GIORGIO:
It’s over.

---

It’s finished.

---



---


## FOSCA:
I’m sorry.

---




## GIORGIO:
Sorry? I would have thought you’d be pleased.

---


## FOSCA:
There was a time I would have welcomed that news, but I realize I don’t wish you to be unhappy. 

---

I don’t wish to see you sad.

---


## GIORGIO:
Yes, well, I feel many things, but I’m not really sad.

---


## FOSCA:
I thought you loved Clara?

---


## GIORGIO:
I did love Clara. I did. But…

---

NO ONE HAS EVER LOVED ME<br>
AS DEEPLY AS YOU.

---

NO ONE HAS TRULY LOVED ME<br>
AS YOU HAVE, FOSCA.

---

LOVE WITHOUT REASON, <br>
LOVE WITHOUT MERCY,<br>
LOVE WITHOUT PRIDE OR SHAME.

---

LOVE UNCONCERNED<br>
WITH BEING RETURNED— 

---

NO WISDOM, NO JUDGMENT,<br>
NO CAUTION, NO BLAME.

---

NO ONE HAS EVER KNOWN ME<br>
AS CLEARLY AS YOU.

---

NO ONE HAS EVER SHOWN ME<br>
WHAT LOVE COULD BE LIKE <br>
UNTIL NOW:

---

NOT PRETTY OR SAFE OR EASY,<br>
BUT MORE THAN I EVER KNEW.

---

LOVE WITHIN REASON— <br>
THAT ISN’T LOVE.

---

AND I’VE LEARNED THAT <br>
FROM YOU…

---



---

Are you cold?

---


## FOSCA:
[crying]
No, I’m afraid.

---


## GIORGIO:
Of what?

---


## FOSCA:
ALL THIS HAPPINESS,<br>
COMING WHEN THERE’S SO LITTLE TIME.

---

TOO MUCH HAPPINESS,<br>
MORE THAN I CAN BEAR.

---

I pray for the strength to enjoy it. 

---

Tomorrow you’ll be gone, this is the only time I have left. 

---

You do love me, don’t you?

---



---


## GIORGIO:
Yes, I love you.

---


## FOSCA:
[crying] 
Say it again.

---


## GIORGIO:
I love you.

---


## FOSCA:
Once more.


## GIORGIO:
I love you. 

---

Be calm. Be strong. I’m yours.

---


## FOSCA:
This isn’t a dream?

---


## GIORGIO:
This isn’t. 

---

We can’t.

---


## FOSCA:
To die loved is to have lived.

## DOCTOR:
“Captain Bachetti. I didn’t write to you before, because I knew your illness might prevent you from comprehending the contents of my letter. 

---

I now have heard that you are closer to recovery and that your nervous condition has improved.

---

I don’t know exactly what you’ve been told, or what you even remember from the events that led you away. 

---

Signora Fosca died three days after the night you last saw one another. 

---

She died unaware of what took place between you and her cousin. 

---

The Colonel’s wound was serious, but not mortal. He recovered in a few months. 

---

I wanted to speak to the Colonel about you in order to convince him of your innocence,

---

but in the end I worried that I might hurt your cause more than help it.

---

In a box that I am mailing, you will find papers left behind in your desk. 

---

Also, I have enclosed some personal belongings of Signora Fosca’s…

---

…And a letter she wrote you just prior to her death.

## SOLDIERS:
THE TOWN, IT IS REMOTE, ISN’T IT?<br>
AND PROVINCIAL— <br>
DON’T YOU THINK?


<div class="fragment">

## CLARA:
I’M FILLING UP OUR ROOM,<br>
OUR LITTLE ROOM,<br>

</div>

WITH EVERY FLOWER IN BLOOM.

---


## LUDOVIC:
THE TIME HAS COME TO FACE<br>
THE TRUTH,<br>
SIGNORINA.


<div class="fragment">

## CLARA:
I’LL HAVE THE FIRE LIT,<br>
THE TABLE SET,<br>

</div>

I’LL WEAR THE BLUE CHEMISE…

---


## SOLDIERS:
THIS STERILE LITTLE TOWN,<br>
THESE POMPOUS LITTLE MEN,

---

THIS MILITARY MADNESS…<br>
UNIFORMS, UNIFORMS…


## CLARA:
IMAGINING YOUR FINGERS TOUCHING MINE.

---


## COLONEL:
AN UNATTRACTIVE WOMAN— 


<div class="fragment">

## CLARA:
IMAGINING OUR ROOM, 
THE BED,

</div>


---


## COLONEL:
—IS EASILY DECEIVED…


<div class="fragment">

## CLARA:
THE SECRECY,
THE WORLD OUTSIDE,

</div>

YOUR MOUTH ON MINE…

## GIORGIO:
“My dearest, Giorgio. The end is near. 

---

“The time has come for me to surrender life gracefully. 

---

“These past two days since you have left, since we were together, have been…a revelation.

---

NOW AT LAST<br>
I SEE WHAT COMES<br>
FROM FEELING LOVED.

---

STRANGE, HOW MERELY<br>
FEELING LOVED,

---

YOU SEE THINGS CLEARLY.<br>
THINGS I FEARED,<br>

LIKE THE WORLD ITSELF

---


## FOSCA, GIORGIO:
I NOW LOVE DEARLY.<br>
I WANT TO LIVE.

---


## FOSCA:
NOW I WANT TO LIVE,<br>
JUST FROM BEING LOVED.

---

ALL THAT PAIN<br>
I NURSED INSIDE<br>
FOR ALL THOSE YEARS— 

---


## GIORGIO:
ALL THOSE VAIN <br>
AND BITTER SELF-CONCERNS— 


## FOSCA, GIORGIO:
ALL THOSE TEARS<br>
AND ALL THAT PRIDE<br>
HAVE VANISHED INTO AIR…


## FOSCA:
I DON’T WANT TO LEAVE.


## GIORGIO:
NOW THAT I AM LOVED,


## FOSCA:
I DON’T WANT TO LEAVE.


## FOSCA, GIORGIO:
EVERYWHERE I TURN,<br>
YOU ARE THERE.

---

EVERYWHERE I LOOK,<br>
THINGS ARE DIFFERENT.

---

EVERYTHING SEEMS RIGHT,<br>
EVERYTHING SEEMS POSSIBLE,<br>
EVERY MOMENT BURSTS WITH FEELING.

---

WHY IS LOVE SO EASY TO GIVE<br>
AND SO HARD TO RECEIVE?


## FOSCA:
BUT THOUGH I WANT TO LIVE,<br>
I NOW CAN LEAVE<br>
WITH WHAT I NEVER KNEW:

---

I’M SOMEONE TO BE LOVED.


## GIORGIO:
I’M SOMEONE TO BE LOVED.


## FOSCA:
AND THAT I LEARNED FROM YOU


## ALL:
I DON’T KNOW HOW I LET YOU

---

SO FAR INSIDE MY MIND,

---

BUT THERE YOU ARE, AND THERE YOU WILL STAY.

---

HOW COULD I EVER WISH YOU AWAY?

---

I SEE NOW I WAS BLIND.


## FOSCA:
AND SHOULD YOU DIE TOMORROW,<br>
ANOTHER THING I SEE:

---


## GIORGIO:
YOUR LOVE WILL LIVE IN ME…
