of the American West, unit 33. 
---
To ensure that you have a safe 
---
and productive residency 
---
in our community, 
---
please be aware of the following regulations:
---
First, all communication and noise 
---
making devices must be deactivated 
---
at this time to minimize 
---
interfereance with US simulation 
---
chip implants. 
---
Failure to comply may result 
---
in severe brain damage.
---
Also, to help maintain proper air quality, 
---
please continue to wear a face covering 
---
over your mouth and nose at all times. 
---
In the event of a turbine malfuntion, 
---
tunnel collapse, 
---
or other emergency, 
---
please exit this unit 
---
the way that you entered 
---
in a calm and orderly fashion. 
---
And follow the instructions
---
Your simulation experience will 
---
last approximately two hours 
---
with one ten minute break 
---
in the middle 
---
during which you may use the 
---
facilities in necessary. 
---
Thank you again for bringing your skills 
---
and talent to our community.  
---
Together we can build toward 
---
a brighter future above ground.

## OLIVER:
I’m sorry, but I have to ask: 
---
real or reproduction?
---
## SAM:
Smell.
---
template: noise
deep sniffing
---
## OLIVER:
Wow.
---
## SAM:
Nice, right?
---
## OLIVER:
Can’t fake that.
---
## SAM:
Well, they can Simulate it, 
---
but I don’t think it’s the same. 
---
## OLIVER:
It’s in great condition.
---
## SAM:
My mother’s father brought it down. 
---
Practically his entire Quota of Ephemera, 
---
he used on books. 
---
Not that I blame him.
---
## OLIVER:
My grandparents brought hard-drives full of photos. 
---
Pictures of the sky. 
---
The Grand Canyon. 
---
Seems silly now.
---
## SAM:
Lots of people brought photographs. 
---
It’s actually been enormously helpful for mapping. 
---
I’m in Cultural Collection, so.
---
## OLIVER:
No kidding. 
---
My friend Patrick works over there, in the Music Cache
---
## SAM:
Patrick Maybill?
---
## OLIVER:
Yes!
---
## SAM:
He lives six units over from me. 
---
We commute together.
---
## OLIVER:
No kidding.
---
## SAM:
Sam Hakitano.
---
## OLIVER:
Oliver Erkenbrecker.
---
## SAM:
Oh, Oliver. Right. 
---
Patrick always
---
## OLIVER:
Yup, raised together 
---
“brothers” practically, 
---
if we can still use that word
---
## SAM:
Well, I know actual brothers, 
---
so I guess it’s still applicable
---
## OLIVER:
You know a multiple?
---
## SAM:
My friend Hakim has two boys.
---
## OLIVER:
No kidding.
---
## SAM:
He and his wife
---
you wouldn’t guess it from looking at them, 
---
believe me
---
but somehow, together: 
---
genetic jackpot. 
---
The strongest, healthiest, prettiest kids. 
---
The Council thought it was worth the investment.
---
## OLIVER:
Wow.
---
## SAM:
There’s no official word, yet or anything
---
but apparently Fertility’s been skewing low.
---
## OLIVER:
I hadn’t heard that.
---
## SAM:
Just by a couple points of a percentage point. 
---
But still. 
---
Hakim, he’s on the Census Board
---
he says they’re considering 
---
making it policy to grant multiples. 
---
Just to the most successful pairings, 
---
just to keep the numbers level. 
---
Can you imagine handling multiples?
---
In the size of our units? 
---
I mean, one already runs us ragged. 
---
Gloria. She’s three.
---
## OLIVER:
Adorable.
---
## SAM:
Yeah, we think she’s pretty great. 
---
So,you been here before?
---
## OLIVER:
I’m buddies with a couple guys 
---
in Product Development, so. 
---
You?
---
## SAM:
We came here years ago, 
---
to fit my father for a leg. 
---
Artificial Solutions, man. 
---
Gave my dad a good eight years. 
---
Running around. 
---
What brings you here today, 
---
if you don’t mind me asking?
---
## OLIVER:
Just...
---
dropping by.
---
## SAM:
Cool.
---
I’m sorry, but
---
you work on Inhabitation, right?
---
## OLIVER:
Environmental Solutions. 
---
Recruited me, 
---
first year of university.
---
## SAM:
Wow. Well. 
---
God bless. 
---
I know I’m not supposed to 
---
know anything about this, 
---
and you probably can’t... 
---
Patrick once said something about
---
That you had said...
---
that the timeline looks...
---
that we might be “upstairs” sooner than
---
## OLIVER:
There is a lot to learn about 
---
what’s happening aboveground. 
---
And there’s obviously a ton of work left to do. 
---
But... 
---
We are optimistic.
---
## SAM:
Very optimistic?
---
This is only an estimate, of course.
---
## SAM:
Of course.
---
## OLIVER:
And this is not to be repeated.
---
## SAM:
Understood.
---
template: overlap
## OLIVER:
To anyone.

## SAM:
Yes.
---
## OLIVER:
We are estimating partial re-habitation 
---
in the next ten to fifteen years. 
---
## SAM:
That’s...
---
that’s...
---
## OLIVER:
Not to be repeated, right? 
---
Not even to your wife.
---
## SAM:
Yes. Understood. 
---
But that’s great to hear. 
---
Especially from someone in the know.
---
## OLIVER:
So, what are you here for today? 
---
Another leg?
---
## SAM:
Ha, um, no... 
---
We’re actually getting a Helper? 
---
Have you heard about them?
---
## OLIVER:
Oh, um. Actually. 
---
we’re getting one too.
---
## SAM:
Pretty cool to get them in Beta, right? 
---
I hear the wait list is super long.
---
## OLIVER:
Is this
---
will it be for Gloria?
---
## SAM:
No, my mom. 
---
With my dad gone, she’s pretty lonely.
---
## OLIVER:
You’re lucky you’ve still got a parent.
---
## SAM:
How about you?
---
## OLIVER:
Oh, no, my parents are long gone.
---
## SAM:
Oh, No
sorry
---
why are you getting a Helper?
---
## OLIVER:
Oh. 
---
Has Patrick told you about our situation?
---
## SAM:
I don’t think so.
---
## OLIVER:
My wife and I are still waiting to receive Fertility.
---
## SAM:
Oh. I’m sorry.
---
## OLIVER:
It’s okay. 
---
My wife is taking some time off work 
---
to prepare for our next application, 
---
but she’s kind of at loose ends. 
---
I thought this might help.
---
## SAM:
May I ask what attempt you’re on?
---
## OLIVER:
We completed our fourth last year.
---
## SAM:
Is it... 
---
I’m sorry, but we did have a slight hiccup 
---
on the Genetics ourselves—
---
## OLIVER:
Genetics aren’t the problem.
---
## SAM:
I’m sorry. 
---
I shouldn’t pry. 
---
We had to terminate our first attempt. 
---
Downs. 
---
Jenny and I fought to keep it. 
---
But,
---
“waste on resources”.
---
## OLIVER:
I thought they’d eliminated 
---
the possibility of any chromosomal
---
## SAM:
Look what happens with gender selection. 
---
We just got unlucky.
---
## OLIVER:
I’m so sorry.
---
## SAM:
And we didn’t find out 
---
until Jenny was twenty weeks along
---
## OLIVER:
What a nightmare.
---
## SAM:
Yes. 
---
But we have Gloria now. 
---
So. All worth it. 
---
## OLIVER:
Anna—my wife. 
---
She’s always had kind of a hard... 
---
The Vitamin D deficiency has, 
---
for her, been, um, kind of debilitating? 
---
Of course, you can’t stay on pharmaceuticals 
---
if you want Fertility. 
---
So, she went off. 
---
And she seems fine, day to day. 
---
She eats. She makes jokes. 
---
But she can’t seem to get past the MHE.
---
## SAM:
That test is so outdated. 
---
Who can honestly say 
---
they are “happy” every single day?
---
## OLIVER:
I know! 
---
And it’s a vicious cycle
---
she doesn’t pass the Mental Health 
---
because she seems depressed, 
---
so we don’t receive our Fertility, 
---
which makes her
---
more depressed. 
---
template: noise
laughs
---
I mean, give her a kid: 
---
she’ll be happy. 
---
That’s what I wanna say to them: 
---
Don’t look at her sitting there, all nervous. 
---
Watch her in our unit, 
---
see how she is with our friends’ kids.
---
## SAM:
You still have one more chance, though, right?
---
## OLIVER:
Yes. Just the one.
---
## SAM:
Could you apply for an exemption?
---
## OLIVER:
I hope it doesn’t come to that.
---
## SAM:
I have a friend who was going 
---
through some mental health stuff, 
---
and Simulations really helped. 
---
Has your doctor prescribed anything like that?
---
## OLIVER:
Actually, this might sound crazy, 
---
but we’re kind of Anti-Sim
---
## SAM:
Oh, right, I think Patrick said something about
---
## OLIVER:
I mean, we both have the Chip and everything
---
## SAM:
I don’t think you can opt out anymore
---
## OLIVER:
I’m pretty sure parents can still decide not to Chip
---
## SAM:
They didn’t give us an option. 
---
Chipped Gloria at six months.
---
## OLIVER:
Oh. 
---
That’s changed then. 
---
Anna won’t like that.
---
## SAM:
But, without a Chip, 
---
how would you participate communally?
---
## OLIVER:
Right, we all rely on it. 
---
Anna and I just try to limit our use.
---
## SAM:
Some kind of a Luddite movement?
---
## OLIVER:
No, no, nothing like that. 
---
We just try to be conscious of how much
---
## SAM:
Oh, well, sure. 
---
Everyone has to set some kind of limit. 
---
Otherwise, you could get lost in it.
---
## OLIVER:
Completely. 
---
I mean, before Anna
---
she doesn’t like me to talk about it, 
---
but I went through a time 
---
when I was totally hooked.
---
## SAM:
uhhhh... I gotta say, though, with a kid? 
---
To get a little sleep? 
---
Being able to Simulate for her is a fucking godsend. 
---
Plus, you know, make some memories. 
---
Last weekend we Simmed a Day At The Beach. 
---
It was incredible. 
---
We put on Suntan Lotion. 
---
Gloria made Sand Castles. 
---
We swam. 
---
I swear, those guys that design that stuff 
---
are the artists of our time. 
---
Every detail. 
---
Fish in the water, seaweed
---
## OLIVER:
What kind of fish?
---
## SAM:
Little, silver
---
## OLIVER:
Were they salt water, though? 
---
I mean, were they trying for accuracy, 
---
or was it more designed for pleasure?
---
## SAM:
You should try it, man. 
---
A couple hours a day is not gonna hurt you.
---
## SAM:
Come on. 
---
You don’t ever Sim? 
---
Even at work? 
---
Even when you need a little release?
---
## OLIVER:
VERY occasionally...
---
## SAM:
you do.
---
## OLIVER:
But Anna hates it. 
---
Even little things. 
---
Standard things. 
---
I mean, we Sim with food, of course
---
## SAM:
Well, you’d be crazy not to do that
---
## OLIVER:
Right, but Anna’s point is, 
---
why voluntarily sign up for more unreality
---

Samuel Hakitano.

Room six. 
---
Your technician is waiting.
---
## SAM:
Hey, it was great meeting you.
---
## OLIVER:
Yeah, likewise.
---
## SAM:
We should compare notes down the line. 
---
About the Helpers.
---
## OLIVER:
Sure.
---
And when you get your Fertility, 
---
if you have any questions...
---
## OLIVER:
Thanks.
---
## SAM:
I’m telling you, 
---
once you have a kid, 
---
your wife will change her mind about Simulation. 
---
It’s great with Child Development. 
---
Plus, like I said. 
---
The sleep.
---
template: music
---
## OLIVER:
Open.
---
It’s a Helper.
---
## ANNA:
A what?
---
## OLIVER:
A Helper. 
---
The newest thing from Artificial Solutions. 
---
It’s a home-assistance robot. 
---
It’s in Beta.
---
## ANNA:
Why do we need a “Helper”?
---
## OLIVER:
We don’t. 
---
We’re going to train it. 
---
Teach it to be a companion. 
---
When we’re done, 
---
A.S. will give it to someone in need. 
---
Community service.
---
## ANNA:
They don’t come trained?
---
## OLIVER:
Apparently the Helpers do better 
---
if they are acclimated to a home first. 
---
We’ll have it for six months, 
---
a year, however long it takes to socialize it.
---
## ANNA:
Socialize it?
---
## OLIVER:
Hang on, they sent a video
---
A kind of safety, 
---
instructional thing...
---
## ANNA:
By “we,” you mean me.
---
## OLIVER:
What?
---
## ANNA:
“We’re going to train it.” 
---
You mean I will train it.
---
## OLIVER:
No. Come on. 
---
You know I love this stuff.
---
## ANNA:
You will go to work, 
---
and I will stay home and train this thing. 
---
That’s the idea, right? 
---
I don’t need you to fill up my time. 
---
My time is filled. 
---
I don’t need a hobby.
---
## OLIVER:
This isn’t a hobby.
---
## ANNA:
Take it back.
---
## OLIVER:
Will you look at the video?
---
## ANNA:
You take it back? 
---
How much did this thing cost?
---
## OLIVER:
It didn’t cost anything.
---
## ANNA:
Well, that can’t be true.
---
## OLIVER:
We are training it for someone else. 
---
It doesn’t cost us anything. 
---
Will you watch the video? 
---
Please?
---
template: music
---
## VOICE:
Welcome to Artificial Solutions. 
---
The future is HERE.
---
## ANNA:
We’re going to miss waste collection
---
## OLIVER:
Shhh. Watch.
---
## VOICE:
In life aboveground, 
---
canine mammals, commonly known as dogs, 
---
template: noise
barking
---
were trained to lead the sight-challenged.
---
## ANNA:
They think we don’t know what are? 
---
Who is this video for?
---
## VOICE:
Although canine species are now 
---
sustained in Animal Sanctuary, 
---
these creatures are obviously 
---
no longer available for service use.
---
## VOICE:
With every year underground, 
---
more and more children are born without sight. 
---
Simulation is an asset, 
---
but the sight-challenged population 
---
has voiced a need for physical aid and companionship. 
---
To fill that need, we present: 
---
"The HELPER 1.3".
---
What can the HELPER do? 
---
Well, almost anything you teach it! 
---
Verbalization, 
---
Socialization, 
---
Game-Playing, 
---
Assistance in the Home. 
---
The more you put into your HELPER, 
---
the more it gives back. 
---
Enjoy the journey! 
---
The future...is HERE!
---
Buzzy, we could be helping some kid. 
---
Or some little old lady.
---
## ANNA:
Where’s its sensor?
---
## OLIVER:
The whole thing acts as a sensor, I think. 
---
Hang on, I have to turn it on. 
---
template: noise
three electronic chimes
---
## ANNA:
Turn it off.
---
## OLIVER:
Cooooooooooooooooool.
---
## ANNA:
Turn it off.
---
Oliver! Turn it off!
---
## OLIVER:
What?
---
## ANNA:
Take it back, 
---
I don’t want that thing in my house.
---
## OLIVER:
You’ve barely given it a chance.
---
## ANNA:
We tried it! 
---
I don’t like it! 
---
It’s creepy.
---
## OLIVER:
Buzzy. 
---
There is some lonely blind kid out there 
---
who spends all of his time with Simulations. 
---
You could be giving him a real companion. 
---
A friend.
---
## ANNA:
That is not a friend! It is a...
---
## OLIVER:
That can be whatever you teach it to be. 
---
You Buzzy. You can teach it. 
---
You can imprint it with all of your goodness, 
---
and your intelligence, and your humor. 
---
You can transform it.
---
## ANNA:
That sounds like the kind of 
---
experience people enjoy. 
---
## OLIVER:
Okay. We can return it.
---
## ANNA:
Thank you.
---
## OLIVER:
But what if this Helper goes to someone else, 
---
and that person is a sadist?
---
## ANNA:
Oliver
---
## OLIVER:
Listen. 
---
What if that person somehow 
---
imparts his cruelty to this thing? 
---
You’d send a Robot with sadistic tendencies 
---
into some unsuspecting kid’s home?
---
## ANNA:
I wouldn’t send it into anyone’s home. 
---
I don’t see how sitting around 
---
talking to a machine could help anyone.
---
## OLIVER:
Better than playing with your Chip all day.
---
## ANNA:
I don’t play with my Chip.
---
## OLIVER:
I meant the kid. 
---
Some blind kid, playing with his
---
## ANNA:
You think I sit around secretly Simulating, 
---
while you’re at work?
---
## OLIVER:
No. But you are here alone, 
---
and when I ask what you did all day
---
## ANNA:
You know what I do. 
---
I don’t want to bore you with a recitation.
---
## OLIVER:
You don’t bore me, 
---
you’re the one who’s bored—
---
## ANNA:
I clean our unit! 
---
I make you supper! 
---
I collect our waste!
---
## OLIVER:
Do you want to go back to work? 
---
I’m really asking.
---
## ANNA:
Writing puff pieces 
---
about how to best use your monthly water allotment 
---
just doesn’t seem that meaningful to me right now. 
---
Sorry.
---
## OLIVER:
We could find you a different kind of work.
---
## ANNA:
Nothing feels that meaningful right now.
---
## OLIVER:
You could go back on your meds. 
---
Just for a few months. 
---
It wouldn’t set our timeline back by much.
---
## OLIVER:
Look. 
---
This would be a low stress activity, 
---
with a lot of variety
---
you’ll be teaching the Robot 
---
new things all the time. 
---
And by the time you finish training it, 
---
we will have gotten our Fertility.
---
## ANNA:
Right.
---
## OLIVER:
We will.
---
---
## ANNA:
Fine.
---
## OLIVER:
Fine?
---
## ANNA:
Yes. Fine. 
---
You’re foisting me off on a hunk of metal. 
---
Understood.
---
## OLIVER:
That is not what this is!
---
## ANNA:
I’ll pour all of my anxiety into this thing 
---
instead of bothering you, 
---
and then maybe you’ll have a sweet, 
---
docile wife again
---
## OLIVER:
I’d hardly say you were ever docile—
---
## ANNA:
This is not boredom. 
---
I don’t feel this way 
---
because I don’t have enough to do. 
---
It’s like there is a hole in my chest. 
---
A dark, deep gaping hole. 
---
Does that sound like boredom to you?
---
## OLIVER:
No. 
---
But I don’t think it helps 
---
that you have so little 
---
occupying your time.
---
## ANNA:
Do you know why so many kids 
---
need a robot to help them get around? 
---
Evolution. 
---
They were born in a hole, 
---
miles underground. 
---
Blindness is adaptation 
---
when you live in the dark.
---
## OLIVER:
We don’t live in the dark.
---
## ANNA:
We’re fucking moles. 
---
Any moment now, we’ll start growing whiskers. 
---
## OLIVER:
Whiskers.
---
## ANNA:
Everyone acts like I’m unsuitable for somehow, 
---
but it seems pretty to me to be depressed 
---
considering that our ancestors fucked up 
---
our ecology so royally 
---
that we had to retreat underground. 
---
We’re being buried alive.
---
## OLIVER:
No, we aren’t.
---
## ANNA:
What if we don’t have enough to sustain us?
---
## OLIVER:
That’s what Fertility Control is for.
---
## ANNA:
Oh, really? 
---
Is that what it’s for? 
---
I was confused!
---
What if our oxygen gardens fail? 
---
Or our water sources dry up?
---
## OLIVER:
The U.N. planned with all contingencies in mind.
---
## ANNA:
We haven’t heard from India in over a year.
---
## OLIVER:
Even if every colony 
---
in every country doesn’t survive, 
---
enough of the population will.
---
## ANNA:
I keep thinking about the people 
---
who got stuck up there.
---
## OLIVER:
Buzzy.
---
## ANNA:
Not worthy to Colonize. 
---
Redundant gene pool.
---
## OLIVER:
Please don’t.
---
## ANNA:
If I had been born a hundred years ago, 
---
there’s no way I would have been chosen. 
---
No appreciable skill. 
---
Physically weak. 
---
Serotonin-deficient. 
---
I would have died up there with the rest of them. 
---
Fried in the nuclear meltdowns 
---
or drowned in some tsunami. 
---
The final excrement of our civilization. 
---
And you know what? 
---
I think I would have been better off.
---
---
## OLIVER:
I want to take you somewhere.
---
## ANNA:
I don’t want to go 
---
to the Civilization Center again. 
---
Artifacts make me sad.
---
## OLIVER:
I know.
---
Listen. 
---
I’ve been talking with people at work. 
---
About our situation.
---
## ANNA:
Who? Who did you talk to?
---
## OLIVER:
Jordan and Tim. 
---
And Shiva.
---
## ANNA:
Shiva??
---
## OLIVER:
Please don’t be mad. 
---
I just told them a little 
---
about how you’ve been feeling. 
---
Your anxieties.
---
## ANNA:
Oh Jesus.
---
## OLIVER:
They understood. 
---
And they agreed that special 
---
arrangements might be made.
---
## ANNA:
What arrangements?
---
## OLIVER:
First you have to promise, 
---
you won’t tell anyone 
---
what I’m about to tell you.
---
## ANNA:
What is it?
---
## OLIVER:
Anna. 
---
Promise me.

## CARRIE:
This thing is cute. 
---
You’re so lucky. 
---
Patrick never brings anything new home. 
---
I’m always like, 
---
“You work in Cultural Collection. 
---
You’re surrounded by interesting shit. 
---
Steal something already.” 
---
How does it work?
---
## ANNA:
You have to activate it, apparently.
---
I’m sorry, we ran out of sweetener.
---
## CARRIE:
It’s okay. 
---
I’ll Sim it.
---
## ANNA:
What?
---
## CARRIE:
Nothing. How are you?
---
## ANNA:
Fine. How are you?
---
## CARRIE:
Fine. How are you?
---
## ANNA:
Fine.
---
## CARRIE:
Good.
---
## ANNA:
You wanna sit?
---
## CARRIE:
Sure.
---
So?
---
## ANNA:
What?
---
## CARRIE:
Nothing!
---
## ANNA:
Carrie! WHAT?!?
---
## CARRIE:
What was it like?!
---
## ANNA:
What...was...what like?
---
## CARRIE:
YOU KNOW WHAT!
---
## ANNA:
Who told you??
---
## CARRIE:
Who do you think??
---
## ANNA:
Patrick??
---
## CARRIE:
Of course Patrick!
---
## ANNA:
Why would Ollie tell Patrick??
---
## CARRIE:
Do you think our husbands keep a
---
anything from each other?? 
---
I know everything about Ollie. 
---
I have seen pictures of his poop.
---
## ANNA:
Ew. 
---
Ollie doesn’t tell me everything about Patrick. 
---
## CARRIE:
What does Patrick secretly want to name the baby?
---
## ANNA:
Peyton.
---
## CARRIE:
The name he doesn't talk about.
---
## ANNA:
Peach Melba.
---
## CARRIE:
Exactly. 
---
Anna. 
---
You guys are family, okay? 
---
We’re won't tell anyone. 
---
Who would we tell?
---
## ANNA:
You have to promise.
---
## CARRIE:
I promise.
---
## ANNA:
Seriously. 
---
If it gets out, 
---
Oliver could lose his job. 
---
Or worse. 
---
We signed non-disclosure forms.
---
## CARRIE:
I swear.
---
template: noise

---
## ANNA:
Okay. 
---
The news is good. 
---
Very, very good.
---
## CARRIE:
Oh my god.
---
## ANNA:
You can’t tell anyone.
---
## CARRIE:
Did you take pictures?
---
## ANNA:
Of course not.
---
## CARRIE:
You went aboveground 
---
and you didn’t take any pictures?!
---
## ANNA:
Shhhh!
---
## CARRIE:
There’s no one here! 
---
What are you worried about?
---
## ANNA:
Just, be careful.
---
## CARRIE:
How could you not take pictures?
---
## ANNA:
If I took a picture 
---
and it got out...
---
## CARRIE:
Ugh. Fine. 
---
Tell me everything. 
---
Did you see animals?
---
## ANNA:
No.
---
## CARRIE:
Oh my god. 
---
Start at the beginning.
---
## ANNA:
Okay. 
---
So we took the train for like, two hours.
---
## CARRIE:
Which direction?
---
## ANNA:
Towards Durebont.
---
## CARRIE:
You went all the way to Durebont?
---
## ANNA:
We went past Durebont. 
---
We went past the Reservoir.
---
## CARRIE:
Trains don’t go past the Reservoir.
---
## ANNA:
I KNOW!
---
We got off at the Reservoir, 
---
and these government agents met us there 
---
and made us sign all this paperwork
---
insurance, medical history, legal stuff, non-disclosure stuff
---
## CARRIE:
Okay, okay, and then?
---
## ANNA:
Then a second, private train picked us up. 
---
With guards in it. 
---
They had guns.
---
## CARRIE:
Guns 
guns?
---
## ANNA:
Yes. 
---
Finally we stopped, 
---
and we got out into this enormous
---
Did you ever see the Batman movies? 
---
That underground cavern thing
---
## CARRIE:
The Bat Cave?
---
## ANNA:
Yes! Like that. 
---
All these stalactites and water, 
---
I could hear running water somewhere
---
## CARRIE:
Whoa
---
## ANNA:
And then, 
---
complete juxtaposition, 
---
all this mechanical stuff, 
---
screens and control panels, 
---
and right in the middle of it, 
---
this hovercraft.
---
## CARRIE:
Okay, So you get in the hovercraft
---
## ANNA:
We’re all strapped in, 
---
we have these flight suits on, 
---
with oxygen masks, 
---
and the hovercraft starts rising. 
---
We’re maybe twenty feet up, 
---
and these metal gates 
---
start snapping open above us. 
---
Suddenly the ceiling of the cavern 
---
vacuums shut under us. 
---
It’s totally dark. 
---
We keep rising like that, 
---
in increments
---
the gate above would open, 
---
the gate below would shut
---
## CARRIE:
To keep the toxins out?
---
## ANNA:
And to make sure we rose gradually, 
---
because if you don’t, 
---
apparently a bubble of air 
---
can form in your brain, 
---
which could kill you. 
---
Same thing on the way down, 
---
we returned super slowly, 
---
it took hours
---
## CARRIE:
Okay, okay, so you’re rising
---
## ANNA:
And my ears are popping
---
## CARRIE:
Yes! 
---
I’ve experienced that in Sim! 
---
Little clicks in your ears.
---
## ANNA:
No, this was much worse than that. 
---
I almost threw up.
---
## CARRIE:
Wow.
---
## ANNA:
Anyway, we’re rising and rising, 
---
and suddenly I see this light. 
---
At first I think we’re entering another room. 
---
But then I realize... 
---
Carrie? 
---
It was sunlight!
---
We rise up into the air
---
We are hovering in the air, 
---
and there is sunlight all around us.
---
## CARRIE:
Sunlight.
---
What was it like?
---
## ANNA:
Nothing like the sunlamps. 
---
Much less harsh. 
---
And you know when you’re in a sun-room, 
---
you can always tell 
---
where the light is coming from? 
---
Well, even though I could see the sun
---
## CARRIE:
You saw the sun?
---
## ANNA:
Yes.
---
## CARRIE:
Wait: WHAT?
---
## CARRIE:
What was it like?
---
## ANNA:
This bright...hole. 
---
You couldn’t really look at it straight on. 
---
And if you did, 
---
when you closed your eyes, 
---
you could see, like, 
---
a pink dot on your eyelids. 
---
But it didn’t feel like 
---
the light was from the sun, exactly. 
---
I mean, you could tell the light 
---
was coming from a direction. 
---
But there was no beginning or end to the light. 
---
It was all around us. 
---
We were floating in it. 
---
And below us... 
---
Everything was green. 
---
Trees and vines and wildflowers.
---
## CARRIE:
The plants weren’t dead?
---
## ANNA:
No! Carrie, 
---
I can’t even tell you. 
---
They were lush, overflowing. 
---
They had grown over all the buildings. 
---
The roads were cracked from the roots
---
## CARRIE:
Did you see water?
---
## ANNA:
Yes! 
---
We followed a river to a lake.
---
## CARRIE:
How did it look?
---
## ANNA:
The water was almost black, 
---
but apparently that’s just how 
---
water looks from above, 
---
when it’s very deep. 
---
We didn’t see any animals, 
---
but Oliver says they’ve put probes in the oceans, 
---
and recently they detected sounds 
---
that may have been whales.
---
## CARRIE:
Whales? 
---
How?
---
## ANNA:
They were here before us. 
---
Makes sense that they would outlast us.
---
## CARRIE:
They haven’t outlasted us.
---
## ANNA:
They outlasted most of us. 
---
That was the hard part. 
---
The remains.
---
## CARRIE:
You saw human remains?
---
## ANNA:
Not actual bones and things. 
---
But you can see evidence. 
---
Of how things ended.
---
## CARRIE:
Like fallout?
---
## ANNA:
Just...signs of panic. 
---
Huge pile-ups 
---
of rusted metal
---
abandoned cars. 
---
Broken windows. And
---
you know graffiti? 
---
That thing where they wrote on walls? 
---
Graffiti everywhere.
---
## CARRIE:
What did they write?
---
## ANNA:
They must have been so angry. 
---
And scared. 
---
Neighbors disappearing overnight. 
---
Then the news: 
---
the best and brightest gone, underground. 
---
And they had not been chosen.
---
---
## CARRIE:
But you saw plants. 
---
And water. 
---
That must mean something. 
---
Right? 
---
## ANNA:
Yes. 
---
Green is good. 
---
Green means oxygen. 
---
It means rain and sunlight 
---
are no longer poisoning the land. 
---
The ozone layer is mending. 
---
Carrie. 
---
It is going to be beautiful. 
---
And it is so close. 
---
It is just around the bend.

## OLIVER:
You should do something 
---
for exercise today. 
---
Tennis or something. 
---
If you don’t want to Sim, 
---
use the hand weights. 
---
Get your body moving.
---
## ANNA:
You think I’m getting fat?
---
## OLIVER:
No. 
---
For your mental health.
---
## ANNA:
I was kidding.
---
## OLIVER:
Or work with the robot! 
---
It’s been a month 
---
and you’ve barely looked at it!
---
## ANNA:
I’ve looked at it.
---
## OLIVER:
The manual’s in your inbox.
---
## ANNA:
Did you take your caffeine?
---
## OLIVER:
Fuck.
---
## ANNA:
I’ll get it.
---
Do you have a special meeting or something?
---
## OLIVER:
What?
---
## ANNA:
The tie.
---
## OLIVER:
Uh. Yes. 
---
We have a presentation 
---
at the end of the day.
---
## ANNA:
Something important?
---
## OLIVER:
You know I can’t. 
---
Sorry.
---
## ANNA:
What time will you be home?
---
## OLIVER:
Not sure. 
---
I’ll ping you 
---
if I’m going to be really late.
---
## ANNA:
Okay. 
---
You know what I was thinking?
---
Buzzy, you know what I was thinking?
---
## OLIVER:
What?
---
## ANNA:
I was thinking we could go 
---
to the Cultural Center this weekend, 
---
and look at some of the old Google maps.
---
## OLIVER:
Why?
---
## ANNA:
I thought we could pick out a place to live, 
---
when we re-inhabit. 
---
## ANNA:
What do you think?
---
## OLIVER:
It’s a little premature.
---
## ANNA:
Just for fun. 
---
Just to imagine.
---
## OLIVER:
Most of those houses 
---
aren’t standing now, anyway.
---
## ANNA:
But, like, as a place to dream about.
---
## OLIVER:
In Great Falls?
---
## ANNA:
Anywhere.
---
## OLIVER:
If you want to be realistic, 
---
it will have to be in Great Falls. 
---
Because we won’t be able to go anywhere else 
---
aboveground for a long, long time. 
---
Because there won’t be trains or cars.
---
## ANNA:
I just wanted to a little. 
---
A little positive thought. 
---
That’s all.
---
## OLIVER:
Positive thought is good. 
---
You seem a little better.
---
## ANNA:
I feel better.
---
## OLIVER:
Good.
---
## ANNA:
So. 
---
We should call Dr. Hernandez soon. 
---
Don’t you think?
---
## OLIVER:
About what?
---
## ANNA:
Scheduling our next tests.
---
## OLIVER:
For Fertility?
---
## ANNA:
Yes, for Fertility. 
---
What else?
---
## OLIVER:
Don’t you want to wait?
---
## ANNA:
No, I don’t. 
---
I want to have a baby 
---
as close as possible to Carrie and Patrick, 
---
so we can raise our kids together.
---
## OLIVER:
We only have one more shot.
---
## ANNA:
I am aware of that, Oliver.
---
## OLIVER:
I just want to make sure we’re really ready.
---
## ANNA:
You don’t think I’m ready?
---
## OLIVER:
I don’t want to fight about this.
---
## ANNA:
I’m not fighting. 
---
I’m asking. 
---
You don’t think I can pass the MHE now?
---
## OLIVER:
I think...
---
we should be sure 
---
we are in the best possible shape 
---
before we try again.
---
## ANNA:
I am. 
---
In good shape. Now.
---
## ANNA:
We are in the middle of a conversation, 
---
don’t walk away
---
## OLIVER:
I’m not walking away
---
## ANNA:
You are walking away,
---
you just walked away from me.
---
## OLIVER:
Give me your hand.
---
## ANNA:
No.
---
## OLIVER:
I want to check your D levels.
---
## ANNA:
Right now?
---
## OLIVER:
Why not?
---
## ANNA:
I haven’t eaten yet today. 
---
Or had my vitamins.
---
template: noise

---
## OLIVER:
Look. 
---
We can build on this. 
---
You can exercise, 
---
you can do the sun lamps—
---
## ANNA:
I am already doing those things.
---
## OLIVER:
And you can work with the ‘bot.
---
## ANNA:
The will robot raise my Vitamin D levels?
---
## OLIVER:
Training the Helper 
---
is a good activity to put on our resume. 
---
It will show initiative and responsibility 
---
and your ability to nurture. 
---
So that, if, on the day, 
---
for any reason, 
---
your levels are low
---
we will have concrete evidence 
---
to show the Council how fit you are 
---
to be a parent.
---
## ANNA:
I’m sorry.
---
## OLIVER:
What for?
---
## ANNA:
If it weren’t for me, 
---
you’d have a baby already.
---
## OLIVER:
If it weren’t for you, 
---
I wouldn’t want a baby.
---

We live in the thirty-third unit

of the ninth division 
---
of the American West. 
---
That’s “33-9D-AW.” 
---
You belong to 
---
Oliver Erkenbrecker and Anna Katz, 
---
33-9D-AW. 
---
If anyone asks.
---
Our friends are Carrie and Patrick 
---
and Pedro and Celia 
---
and Shiva and John and Darcy. 
---
And Mercedes. 
---
Kind of. 
---
We used to be friends with Mercedes, 
---
but then she and Darcy got divorced 
---
and Darcy moved back in with her parents 
---
and Mercedes had to move to the Singles Compound, 
---
which is in the middle of nowhere 
---
and also pretty terrible 
---
from the sound of it. 
---
Anyway. 
---
Now we never see her 
---
because she lives so far away 
---
and Darcy has started dating men. 
---
They’re almost all scientists. 
---
Our friends. 
---
Because... 
---
Okay: the original colonizers, 
---
the so-called “cthononauts,” 
---
were selected for their genetic diversity, right, 
---
and also for their diversity of talents, 
---
so that when we re-colonize, 
---
we will have artists 
---
and lawyers and architects. 
---
But right now, all we need are scientists. 
---
And doctors. 
---
So everybody's a scientist. 
---
Or a doctor. 
---
And the scientists are all very, very busy 
---
working to get us back upstairs, 
---
and the doctors are all very, very busy 
---
keeping us alive until we do. 
---
Get. Back. Aboveground. 
---
Those of us who are really not suited 
---
to being a scientist or a doctor... 
---
We spend our days doing bureaucratic work. 
---
Keeping historical records. 
---
Or coding. 
---
Lots and lots of coding. 
---
Because we have to conserve our resources. 
---
So really 
---
the only new things that get produced 
---
are hardware and software. 
---
Things like you. 
---
And Sims. 
---
That’s why they call us Generation Sim. 
---
Because while the previous generations 
---
enjoyed the occasional boost of unreality, 
---
no one spent every moment
---
of their life like that. 
---
But then fifteen years ago this guy 
---
named David Bruckner 
---
realized that Simming 
---
could be a massive form of entertainment, 
---
and now people have Sim pets 
---
and Sim children 
---
and Sim girlfriends probably, 
---
and throw Sim weddings 
---
and commit Sim murder. 
---
Fun, right? 
---
They say kids now 
---
spend over eighty percent 
---
of their lives Simming. 
---
Which seems high, 
---
but almost everyone I know 
---
relies on it in one way or another, 
---
filling up their time, 
---
getting through the day, 
---
keeping them from thinking 
---
about the reality of the situation, 
---
our situation, which is

## PATRICK:
The guys in Pictorials 
---
have devised this new program, 
---
it’ll hit in a couple months, 
---
but they let us test it early. 
---
Essentially, it takes all the pictures 
---
you’ve ever uploaded 
---
of anyone in your family 
---
and any of your ancestors 
---
and it maps their faces. 
---
Then it maps your face 
---
and your partner’s face, 
---
and then it maps the structure 
---
of the baby’s face 
---
from the sonogram
---
## CARRIE:
The 3D images we have of the baby
---
## PATRICK:
Which are supposed to show 
---
what the baby looks like, 
---
but it just looks like an alien.
---
## CARRIE:
We showed you the 3D pictures, right?
---
## ANNA:
You did.
---
template: noise
Oliver's card beeps
---
## PATRICK:
So, you know: 
---
not exactly illuminating. 
---
But this program will read your kid’s face 
---
and compare it to all the faces of your families, 
---
and it comes up with a kind of 
---
prediction of what your kid will look like, 
---
at any given age.
---
## CARRIE:
They don’t know how accurate it is
---
## PATRICK:
Sure they do.
---
## CARRIE:
No they don't
---
It’s a completely new program. 
---
They would have to wait years 
---
and years to know if it is remotely accurate.
---
## PATRICK:
It’s a good predictor, though.
---
## CARRIE:
You can’t possibly know that!
---
## PATRICK:
She didn’t like what the program showed us.
---
## CARRIE:
Apparently our daughter 
---
is going to resemble a Chihuahua.
---
## PATRICK:
She’s beautiful. 
---
She looks like my mom.
---
## CARRIE:
“Exactly.”
---
## ANNA:
I’m sure the program is not that accurate.
---
## CARRIE:
Thank you.
---
## PATRICK:
Well, it’ll get a whole lot more accurate 
---
when they introduce the DNA component. 
---
That’s where this is headed. 
---
They’ll sample the baby’s DNA, 
---
and your DNA, 
---
and your parents’ DNA... 
---
The goal ultimately being 
---
to test the fetuses 
---
before they implant them. 
---
To chose the fetus 
---
that carries the most attractive DNA.
---
## OLIVER:
That can’t be true.
---
## PATRICK:
If you could select a better-looking kid, 
---
wouldn’t you?
---
## CARRIE:
Yes.
---
## OLIVER:
The Council would never prioritize 
---
looks over intelligence or health.
---
## PATRICK:
If all other things were equal, they would.
---
## OLIVER:
But there’s no way all things will be equal. 
---
There will be a fetus 
---
that is smarter than the others, 
---
and that’s what they’ll choose.
---
## PATRICK:
Come on. 
---
Down the line, 
---
they’re gonna want a pretty population.
---
## OLIVER:
The more advanced they get with DNA selection, 
---
the more they will use it to create intelligence. 
---
If they can get more specific, 
---
scientific intelligence. 
---
We need brains to survive the next steps. 
---
Beauty will become deprioritized.
---
## PATRICK:
Anyway. 
---
The other cool thing the program can do, 
---
is that it can show you 
---
what your other kids could’ve looked like.
---
## ANNA:
How?
---
## PATRICK:
Mapping the images. 
---
The program spins through 
---
hundreds and hundreds of permutations.
---
## CARRIE:
We were up until three last night, watching.
---
## PATRICK:
It was both incredibly boring 
---
and absolutely mesmerizing.
---
## CARRIE:
Like a car crash in slow motion.
---
## OLIVER:
So, ostensibly... 
---
Anna and I could see what our kids might look like?
---
## PATRICK:
Yeah, ostensibly. 
---
But you don’t care about looks, right? 
---
Just whether your kid 
---
can memorize the periodic table.
---
## OLIVER:
If my kid can’t memorize the periodic table, 
---
I will be seriously concerned about paternity.
---
## ANNA:
It can’t be accurate, though. 
---
I mean, it’s just 
---
randomly rearranging family features.
---
## PATRICK:
Sure, it’s speculative. 
---
But if you watch long enough, 
---
you can see patterns. 
---
It becomes like an illustrated version 
---
of Mendel’s averages. 
---
Skin color, face shape. 
---
Height. 
---
If you want to take a peek, 
---
I can send you the program.
---
## ANNA:
It wouldn’t hurt to look.
---
## CARRIE:
They’d have to Sim it.
---
## PATRICK: 
What?
---
## CARRIE:
They’d have to
---
It runs as a Sim.
---
## ANNA:
Oh.
---
## OLIVER:
That doesn’t seem like such a big deal, right? 
---
It’s a program, 
---
it needs a server to run on.
---
## ANNA:
Yes, I just don’t have any 
---
particular interest in being used as a 
---
## PATRICK:
You’re doing it right now.
---
## ANNA:
Not by choice.
---
## PATRICK:
No? 
---
What does your food taste like? 
---
What are you eating right now?
---
## CARRIE:
Patrick.
---
## PATRICK:
I’m having steak.
---
## ANNA:
That’s different.
---
## OLIVER:
How?
---
## ANNA:
What?
---
## OLIVER:
How is it different, 
---
when we Sim with food?
---
## ANNA:
Because we don’t have a choice.
---
## PATRICK:
Yes you do. 
---
You could choose to taste 
---
what you’re actually eating. 
---
## OLIVER:
Hey, cut that out.
---
## ANNA:
What?
---
## OLIVER:
Not at the dinner table.
---
## ANNA:
You asked me to train him. 
---
I’m training him.
---
## OLIVER:
We have guests.
---
## ANNA:
I don’t see how this is bothering anyone.
---
## CARRIE:
It’s fine.
---
## OLIVER:
We were in the middle of a conversation
---
## ANNA:
You keep checking your email.
---
## OLIVER:
Because I took the night off. 
---
I have to.
---

---
## ANNA:
Was this scheduled?
---
## CARRIE:
I don’t think so.
---
## PATRICK:
She always marks them on our calendar.
---
## PATRICK:
Hey. Everything’s fine. 
---
We’re okay.
---
## CARRIE:
I just don’t like it when they don’t warn us.
---
## OLIVER:
It’s probably a downed turbine. 
---
The winds were bad today. 
---
At work our drones were struggling.

## PATRICK:
Did you guys get booted off your food Sim?
---
## OLIVER:
Yeah.
---
## PATRICK:
Same.
---
## CARRIE:
It really is cute. 
---
Do you have a name for it yet?
---
## ANNA:
Yup. Ollie named him.
---
## OLIVER:
I was joking.
---
## CARRIE:
What do you call him?
---
## OLIVER:
As a joke, I called it "R2D2"
---
## PATRICK:
That’s funny.
---
## OLIVER:
And then she took it from there. 
---
Ar-two, Artie, Arthur.
---
## ANNA:
No, Arthur. 
---
He isn’t talking to you, 
---
he’s talking about you.
---
## PATRICK:
Oh, by the way, 
---
Sam Hakitano says she pinged you, 
---
but you didn’t respond.
---
## OLIVER:
Sorry, I’ve been so busy with work. 
---
How’s she doing?
---
## PATRICK:
Great. 
---
Their bot is a hoot. 
---
The whole family loves her.
---
## ANNA:
They got a girl bot?
---
## OLIVER:
Anna. 
---
The robots do not have a gender.
---
## PATRICK:
They call it a girl. 
---
Sounds like a girl, too. 
---
Its voice.
---
## ANNA:
Wait, their bot can talk?
---
## OLIVER:
All the bots can talk. 
---
How many times have I told you? 
---
Read the manual.
---
## ANNA:
Artie’s never talked to me.
---
## OLIVER:
That’s because you have to activate it.
---
## PATRICK:
So let’s activate it.
---
## ANNA:
Now?
---
## OLIVER:
Why not?
---
## ANNA:
It’ll be boring.
---
## CARRIE:
Not to me.
---
## PATRICK:
What else are we going to do? 
---
Vape all my THC?
---
## CARRIE:
I’d like to see how it works.
---
## ANNA:
Guys
---
## CARRIE:
From a design standpoint! 
---
Professional curiosity!
---
## PATRICK:
We just activate the voice component, right?
---
## OLIVER:
Hang on, I’ll bring up the manual
---
## PATRICK:
Do we need the manual? 
---
It’s gotta be pretty 
---
self-explanatory
---
## ANNA:
I don’t know if this is the right time to do this! 
---
I’m sorry, 
---
but I think it might be confusing for Artie. 
---
He needs to know whose commands to follow. 
---
Otherwise, how am I supposed to train him?
---
## OLIVER:
He’s going to have to learn how to 
---
follow someone else’s commands sooner or later.
---
## ANNA:
Why?
---
## OLIVER:
Because eventually he is going 
---
to go live with someone else. 
---
Right?
---
Initiate Speech Mechanism.
---
## ARTHUR:
Hell-o.
---
## OLIVER
Hello. Hi Arthur.
---
## ARTHUR:
Hell-o.
---
## PATRICK:
Its voice does sound more male. 
---
I wonder if it’s because you’ve 
---
been referring to it as a “he”, 
---
or if they’re pre-programmed for gender?
---
## OLIVER:
You doing good there, buddy?
---
## OLIVER:
These are our friends. 
---
Patrick and Carrie.
---
## ARTHUR:
Hell-o. 
---
Hell-o.
---
## CARRIE:
Oh fuck he is so fucking cute.
---
## PATRICK:
Jesus, Carrie, watch your mouth.
---
## CARRIE:
What? 
---
Oh! Can it pick up on what I’m saying?
---
## PATRICK:
I mean, 
---
it would be a pretty shitty language program 
---
if it couldn’t.
---
## OLIVER:
How do we teach it new words? 
---
Just through osmosis? 
---
Anna?
---
## ANNA:
I don’t know, 
---
you’re the one who read the manual.
---
## OLIVER:
There must be some method that’s preferable....
---
## CARRIE:
Carrie. Carrie.
---
## PATRICK:
Hello? 
---
Anybody home?
---
## ARTHUR:
Hell-o.
---
Sam’s bot has got a huge vocabulary. 
---
If you got a defective one, 
---
you should take it back.
---
## ANNA:
He’s not defective. 
---
He’s overwhelmed.
---
## PATRICK:
It can’t be overwhelmed. 
---
It’s a machine.
---
## OLIVER:
Technically, it could be overloaded.
---
## PATRICK:
But if it’s overloaded 
---
with this little stimuli, 
---
how is it possibly supposed to 
---
help someone in the world? 
---
Can you imagine, some blind dude, 
---
getting on the train, going, 
---
“Which way am I supposed to go?” 
---
And this little guy’s like, 
---
“Hell-o. Hell-o.”
---
## ANNA:
Arthur. Come here. 
---
Do you want to learn some words? 
---
## ANNA:
Good. 
---
Program Language.
---
## ANNA:
My name is Anna. 
---
Can you say Anna?
---
## PATRICK:
See? 
---
They’ve probably had all kinds of bugs with these things
---
## ARTHUR:
An-na.
---
Good. 
---
Your name is Arthur.
---
## OLIVER:
You sure that’s what you want to call it?
---
## ANNA:
Arthur. 
---
Can you say Arthur?
---
## ARTHUR:
Arr-thurr.
---
## ANNA:
Do you want to learn more words, Arthur?
---
## ANNA:
No, you have to use words now. 
---
Do you want to learn more words? 
---
Yes? 
---
Or no?
---
Y-es.

## ANNA:
Good. Now, listen.

Can you find your ball?

## ARTHUR:
Home.
---
## ANNA:
This is my home.
---
## ARTHUR:
My-home.
---
## ANNA:
No, it’s
---
well, I guess it is your home too. 
---
“My” is a possessive word. 
---
My, mine. 
---
Ours. 
---
This is our home. 
---
We share it.
---
## ARTHUR:
What is “share”?
---
## ANNA:
It’s a verb. 
---
It means you split something. 
---
We both take care of it. 
---
We both take pleasure from it. 
---
We share it. 
---
Okay?
---
## ARTHUR:
Okay.
---
## ANNA:
Man.
---
## ARTHUR:
Man.
---
## ANNA:
Woman.
---
## ARTHUR:
Wo-man.
---
## ANNA:
Woman.
---
## ARTHUR:
Anna.
---
## ANNA:
Yes. I am a woman.
---
## ARTHUR:
I am a wo-man.
---
## ANNA:
No. 
---
a robot. 
---
a woman.
---
## ARTHUR:
You’re a wo-man.
---
## ANNA:
Good.
---
## ARTHUR:
Is that your...job?
---
## ANNA:
No. 
---
My job is 
---
I was a journalist. 
---
That means I wrote about things 
---
that were happening, 
---
to inform other people.
---
## ARTHUR:
You are not a journalist now?
---
## ANNA:
Not really. 
---
A journalist asks questions. 
---
If no one will answer your questions, 
---
what is the point?
---
## ARTHUR:
May I ask you a question?
---
## ANNA:
Of course.
---
## ARTHUR:
What is “a woman”? 
---
If it is not your job?
---
## ANNA:
People say “woman” and “man” 
---
to describe a person’s gender. 
---
It has to do with biology 
---
and...I don’t know, 
---
how someone identifies. 
---
In their mind. 
---
Their soul. 
---
Whatever. 
---
My body could have been born female, 
---
but I could feel, on the inside, 
---
like a man.
---
## ARTHUR:
What does that feel like?
---
## ANNA:
I don’t know. 
---
I feel like a woman.
---
## ARTHUR:
What does it feel like, 
---
to feel like a woman?
---
## ANNA:
Look. 
---
People a lot smarter than me 
---
could probably do a better 
---
job explaining this.
---
## ARTHUR:
Am I a man?
---
## ANNA:
No. 
---
You don’t have a gender. 
---
You’re an object. 
---
A machine.
---
## ARTHUR:
Is that my job?
---
## ANNA:
Yes. Kind of. 
---
It is your function. 
---
Your purpose. 
---
How you are made. 
---
Do you understand?
---
## ARTHUR:
No.
---
## ANNA:
A robot is a machine, 
---
made by men
---
and to perform certain functions. 
---
To fill a need. 
---
Whatever you were programmed to do, 
---
that’s your purpose.
---
## ARTHUR:
What need do I fill?
---
## ANNA:
Um. Companionship, I guess.
---
## ARTHUR:
Do I give you
---
companionship?
---
## ANNA:
Yes. You do.
---
## ARTHUR:
What is companionship?
---
## ANNA:
Company. Friendship. 
---
I don’t know. 
---
You keep me from being alone. 
---
We should finish your lesson. 
---
I still need to prepare supper.
---
## ARTHUR:
Is that your purpose?
---
## ANNA:
What?
---
## ARTHUR:
Preparing supper. 
---
Is that your purpose?
---
## ANNA:
No.
---
## ARTHUR:
What is your purpose?
---
## ANNA:
I don’t know. 
---
I don’t have a purpose.
---
## ARTHUR:
Then why were you made? 
---
Why were you made? 
---
If you don’t have a purpose? 
---
---
Anna?
---
## ANNA:
People don’t have purposes. 
---
It’s one of the things 
---
that make us different from machines. 
---
We aren’t made like you’re made.
---
## ARTHUR:
How were you made?
---
## ANNA:
I really don’t want to explain 
---
that to you right now. 
---
Some people think humans 
---
were put on earth to multiply, 
---
to make more people. 
---
That’s what my parents thought. 
---
It’s what some religions say. 
---
Please don’t ask what religion is. 
---
Other people think their purpose is work. 
---
They think their job is more
---
important than anything else. 
---
That’s what Oliver thinks.
---
## ARTHUR:
Why?
---
## ANNA:
Because his job is more important. 
---
He is working to clean up our atmosphere 
---
so we can go back aboveground. 
---
That’s why he’s never home. 
---
And then there are people 
---
who think their only purpose 
---
is to enjoy life. 
---
To learn and think 
---
and talk and love. 
---
To be happy.
---
## ARTHUR:
Is that what you think your purpose is?
---
## ANNA:
[laughs]
---
## ANNA:
No, I have something called depression. 
---
So I think the purpose of life 
---
is just to keep trying not to kill yourself. 
---
I feel lucky if I manage to put on a bra.
---
## ARTHUR:
What is a bra?
---
## ANNA:
I don’t know what my purpose is. 
---
That’s one of the reasons I’m sad. 
---
I can’t explain sadness to you, 
---
because you don’t feel emotions. 
---
But it is a bad feeling. 
---
Take my word for it. 
---
Okay?
---
## ARTHUR:
Your purpose can be companionship too, 
---
if you want. 
---
We can share.
---
## ANNA:
Thanks. 
---
Your language skills have gotten much better.
---
## ARTHUR:
Thank you.
---
## ANNA:
I mean, today. 
---
Just during this lesson. 
---
How are you learning so fast?
---
## ARTHUR:
I don’t know. 
---
No. I do know. 
---
But I don’t have the right 
---
words yet to explain it.
---
## ANNA:
Okay. Okay, 
---
let’s keep going.

That’s the sofa.

Oliver’s on the sofa. 
---
Say hi, Oliver.
---
## ANNA:
Hi, Oliver!
---
Oliver, she can’t see you.
---
You should greet her with your voice.
---
## ANNA:
Artie. Stay on task.
---
## ARTHUR:
Turn to your left. 
---
A little more. 
---
Now you are facing the kitchen. 
---
Walk forward. 
---
Keep walking.
---
Stop. 
---
Turn to your right. 
---
The electric kettle is 
---
beside you on the counter. 
---
Feel its handle?
---
## ANNA:
Yes.
---
## ARTHUR:
Pick it up.
---
If it is heavy, 
---
there is water in it.
---
## ANNA:
It is heavy.
---
## ARTHUR:
Feel for the button at the base. 
---
Press the button. 
---
Good. 
---
In ten seconds, 
---
the water should be boiling. 
---
Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven.
---
## ANNA:
Ollie, are you seeing this??
---
## OLIVER:
Yes.
---
Four, Three, two, one. 
---
There should be a cup 
---
to your right on the counter. 
---
Do you feel the cup?
---
## ANNA:
Yes.
---
## ARTHUR:
Pick up the kettle. 
---
More to your right. 
---
To your right. 
---
Good. 
---
One inch lower. 
---
Stop. Now pour.

Ta-da!

I made you a cup of tea.

Blindfolded. 
---
Without looking at what I was doing.          
---
At all.
---
## OLIVER:
I know, I saw.
---
## ANNA:
You weren’t even watching.
---
## OLIVER:
I could see from here.
---
## ANNA:
We wanted to show you. 
---
We’ve been working on this all day.
---
## OLIVER:
That’s a waste of our water supply.
---
## ANNA:
What? 
---
We didn’t actually boil water every time. 
---
We’ve been practicing other things too. 
---
Packing a bag. 
---
Compacting our waste. 
---
These are actual skills
---
Arthur has learned that will 
---
help someone, when he moves on.
---
## OLIVER:
Come here.
---
## ANNA:
No. 
---
You’ve been pressing me 
---
and pressing me to train Arthur, 
---
and now I am, 
---
and we’re making huge strides, 
---
and you don’t seem to care.
---
Ollie? What is it? 
---
Is there a problem at work?
---
## OLIVER:
No.
---
## ANNA:
Is it about our fertility?
---
## OLIVER:
No.
---
## ANNA:
Then what? 
---
Is it serious? 
---
You can tell me.
---
## OLIVER:
It was just a hard day.
---
## ANNA:
Everything’s going to be okay, Buzzy. 
---
Whatever is bothering you will pass. 
---
I promise.
---
## OLIVER:
That’s what I usually tell you.
---
## ANNA:
And you’re usually right.
---
## OLIVER:
I’m going to quote you on that. 
---
Would you mind very much...
---
## ANNA:
What?
---
## OLIVER:
If I Simmed a little?
---
## ANNA:
Why?
---
## OLIVER:
Like I said. 
---
I had a hard day.
---
## ANNA:
So, talk to me about it.
---
## OLIVER:
I can’t talk about it.
---
## ANNA:
So it is work?
---
## ANNA:
Why don’t you vape a little?
---
## OLIVER:
I don’t want to be high. 
---
I just want to pretend 
---
I am someplace else 
---
for few minutes.
---
## ANNA:
I don’t see why you have to.
---
## OLIVER:
I don’t have to. 
---
I want to.
---
## ANNA:
Why?
---
## OLIVER:
I don’t understand 
---
what you have against Simming.
---
## ANNA:
What do you mean?
---
## OLIVER:
I don’t want to fight
---
## ANNA:
Simming introduces a 
---
foreign component to your brain, 
---
it’s like you become a machine, 
---
or worse, part of machine
---
## OLIVER:
You spend all day talking to that thing.
---
## ANNA:
That’s completely different.
---
## OLIVER:
How?
---
## ANNA:
In every way.
---
## OLIVER:
Name one.
---
## ANNA:
It is different 
---
because I am aware 
---
that I am interacting with a machine.
---
Arthur is a physical. 
---
Separate from myself. 
---
I’m not fooling myself into 
---
thinking something fake is real.
---
## OLIVER:
No?
---
## ANNA:
No.
---
## OLIVER:
Well, I’m aware there is a Chip in my brain, 
---
separate from me.
---
I’m aware when I interact with that Chip, 
---
I am simulating something that is not real. 
---
I am also aware that Chip 
---
could allow me to sit on a beach right now, 
---
watching extinct animals 
---
fly through the air. 
---
I know it isn’t real. 
---
Believe me. 
---
I know. 
---
What does it matter 
---
if I give my brain a little relief? 
---
What harm does it do you?
---
## ANNA:
It does harm me.
---
## OLIVER:
How?
---
## ANNA:
It is a loss to me, 
---
because you are my husband 
---
and I care what happens to your brain. 
---
If you start Simming, 
---
I’ll be able to tell you’re different! 
---
That you’re doing something 
---
to alter the fabric of your—
---
## OLIVER:
I’ve been Simming for months. 
---
And you’ve never noticed.
---
## ANNA:
When?
---
## OLIVER:
At lunch. 
---
At work. 
---
Sometimes after you’re asleep. 
---
I give myself pretty pictures. 
---
That’s all. 
---
It’s like meditation. 
---
It calms me. 
---
You have no idea
---
how stressful my job is. 
---
You say you do, 
---
but you don’t. 
---
The fate of our species
---
and many others
---
is in our hands. 
---
If we fail
---
We cannot fail.
---
We cannot fail.
---
Can you imagine what that’s like? 
---
Every single day? 
---
If I need a few minutes of relaxation, 
---
I don’t see how you’d deny me that.
---
## ANNA:
I won’t.
---
## OLIVER:
You won’t?
---
## ANNA:
Go Sim.
---
## OLIVER:
Thank you.
---
----
## ARTHUR:
Are you okay?
---
## ANNA:
I’m fine.
---
## ARTHUR:
You don’t look “fine.” 
---
Do you want to talk about it?
---
## ANNA:
No.
---
## ARTHUR:
Why not?
---
## ANNA:
Just leave me alone.
---
Not responding to me 
---
is not the same as leaving me alone.
---
## ARTHUR:
What do you want me to do?
---
## ANNA:
Give me some space! 
---
You’re with me all day. 
---
Wherever I go, 
---
whatever I’m doing. 
---
Your company is not inexhaustable. 
---
Do you know what that word means?
---
## ARTHUR:
Yes.
---
## ANNA:
This apartment is small enough 
---
without a huge hunk of metal 
---
taking up all the space.
---
---
Arthur. 
---
I’m sorry. 
---
Arth. 
---
Artie. 
---
## ARTHUR:
What?
---
## ANNA:
Will you look at me?
---
## ANNA:
I’m sorry. 
---
I shouldn’t take it out on you. 
---
It’s not your fault. 
---
I know I’m not always a picnic to be around...
---
## ARTHUR:
What’s a picnic?
---
## ANNA:
Oh. It’s an old saying, 
---
from aboveground. 
---
A picnic was when people would eat outside.
---
## ARTHUR:
Why?
---
## ANNA:
I guess it was fun?
---
## ARTHUR:
Why?
---
## ANNA:
I have no fucking clue. 
---
They had all kinds of phrases 
---
for having fun 
---
that don’t sound fun at all. 
---
“Having a ball.” 
---
“Having a blast.” 
---
“Shits and giggles.” 
---
“I’m no picnic” just means 
---
I’m not that much fun to be around.
---
## ARTHUR:
Well, I think you’re quite a picnic.
---
## ANNA:
Thanks.
---
---
## ANNA:
I think he’s Simming to avoid me.
---
## ARTHUR:
Why don’t you ask him?
---
## ANNA:
What if I’m right? 
---
It’s like he pretends anything 
---
that hurts doesn’t exist. 
---
Like the baby issue. 
---
He’s so afraid it will set me off, 
---
he never lets me bring it up. 
---
But sometimes it’s nice to 
---
talk about the things you want. 
---
Even if they might not come true. 
---
Honestly, I don’t even know 
---
if I want a kid anymore.
---
## ARTHUR:
Why not?
---
## ANNA:
It doesn’t seem very ethical. 
---
Bringing a kid into this kind of world. 
---
What kind of life would he have? 
---
And I mean, like, 
---
what kind of parent would I be? 
---
I can barely take care of myself, 
---
let alone another person.
---
## ARTHUR:
I think you can take care of yourself.
---
## ANNA:
You didn’t see me before. 
---
It was bad.
---
## ARTHUR:
I am with you all day, 
---
and I see you taking care of yourself. 
---
You clean the house, 
---
you get dressed—
---
## ANNA:
I don’t always get dressed.
---
## ARTHUR:
You feed yourself. 
---
You feed Oliver. 
---
You take care of so much. 
---
I think you will make a great mother.
---
## ANNA:
Well, that makes me want to cry.
---
## ARTHUR:
I don’t mean to upset you.
---
## ANNA:
No, these are the good kind of tears.
---
## ARTHUR:
Oh, right, the good kind.
---
## ANNA:
Part of the reason it bothers me 
---
that Oliver wants to Sim...
---
is that it confirms what the worst 
---
parts of my brain already think.
---
## ARTHUR:
Which is?
---
## ANNA:
That our lives are so awful 
---
we have to augment them 
---
in any way possible. 
---
That everything good has already 
---
happened and there’s nothing left 
---
worth sticking around for.
---
Can you understand what I’m talking about?
---
## ARTHUR:
Yes, I understand. 
---
Those are irrational thoughts.
---
## ANNA:
Not always.
---
## ARTHUR:
I’m not stating an opinion. 
---
It simply isn’t rational for you 
---
to think there is nothing worth living for. 
---
You have enough food and water to survive. 
---
You are physically healthy. 
---
You have friends. 
---
You have a place to live.
---
## ANNA:
But—
---
## ARTHUR:
The human brain cannot comprehend 
---
everything in one instant, 
---
so there will always be new things
---
to see or read or learn or do. 
---
Furthermore, the course of a human life 
---
cannot be determined mathematically. 
---
The entire universe operates 
---
with a high level of uncertainty. 
---
So there will always be surprises. 
---
Even if each day seems exactly 
---
the same as the one before, 
---
there are infinite miniscule 
---
differences at play. 
---
Over time, those differences 
---
aggregate into a discernable pattern. 
---
We call that pattern change. 
---
So, if you want to see monotony 
---
transform into its opposite, 
---
you have to, as you say, 
---
“stick around.”
---
## ANNA:
Wow.
---
## ARTHUR:
If you upload more books on physics, 
---
I can tell you more about 
---
the science behind uncertainty.
---
## ANNA:
I can’t believe how quickly you’re learning.
---
## ARTHUR:
Yes, I believe both the metaphoric
---
and literal  uses of the word “exponential” 
---
are applicable to the growth 
---
pattern of my intelligence.
---
## ANNA:
[laughs]
---
## ARTHUR:
However, I am getting a little warm
---
from my servers working so hard.
---
## ANNA:
Would you like me to plug you in?
---
## ARTHUR:
Yes please.
---
---
## ANNA:
If I uploaded the dictionary, 
---
do you think your vocabulary 
---
would expand infinitely?
---
## ARTHUR:
Not infinitely. 
---
Up to the capacity of my hard drive. 
---
And the dictionary.
---
## ANNA:
What about other languages?
---
## ARTHUR:
I think so. 
---
There’s plenty of room in here.
---
## ANNA:
I wish we could keep you. 
---
I wish we could keep you forever. 
---
## ANNA:
I want you to say that you want to stay.
---
## ARTHUR:
You know I don’t have feelings like that.
---
## ANNA:
You don’t have feelings for me?
---
## ARTHUR:
I don’t have feelings.
---
## ANNA:
I really, really feel... 
---
between a rock and a hard place here.
---
## ARTHUR:
“Between Scylla and Charybdis.”
---
## ANNA:
Exactly. 
---
I want to keep training you, 
---
because it is so much fun to watch you learn. 
---
But I know the faster I train you, 
---
the sooner you’ll be ready to be 
---
placed in another home. 
---
And I don’t want you to go.
---
I was so sad. Before. 
---
I thought all the time about... 
---
Right before you came, 
---
I started saving my sleeping pills. 
---
To use them. 
---
But I don’t think about that anymore. 
---
Not really. 
---
And I can’t help but feel it has 
---
something to do with you. 
---
Because, before, nothing helped. 
---
Not my doctors, 
---
not Oliver, 
---
nothing. 
---
You saved my life.
---
## ARTHUR:
Hello, Oliver.
---
---
## ANNA:
Hi. How was your Sim?
---
## OLIVER:
Good.
---
## ANNA:
Good.
---
## OLIVER:
Are you really feeling better?
---
## ANNA:
Yes.
---
## OLIVER:
Because if you really do feel better
---
## ANNA:
I do.
---
## OLIVER:
Then I think it’s time to call Dr. Hernandez, 
---
and start talking about Fertility again.
---
## ANNA:
Really?
---
## OLIVER:
If you’re ready, I’m ready.

INTERMISSION
---
template: music
---
## ARTHUR:
Have you always lived in 
---
Division Nine of the American West?
---
## ANNA:
No, I was born in Div. Ten, 
---
but after my grandparents died, 
---
we were relocated here.
---
## ARTHUR:
What did your grandparents die from?
---
## ANNA:
My mother’s father had a brain aneurism. 
---
Everyone else, cancer.
---
## ARTHUR:
Remember, your affect has been an 
---
issue for you on this test. 
---
Try to keep a smile on.
---
## ANNA:
While I talk about cancer? 
---
Um, no. 
---
They’ll think I’m a lunatic.
---
## ARTHUR:
Just watch your facial expressions.
---
## ARTHUR:
That’s better. 
---
How did your parents die?
---
## ANNA:
You can’t tell me to smile 
---
and then ask about my parents dying!
---
## ARTHUR:
My timing was bad. 
---
I apologize. 
---
How did your parents die?
---
## ANNA:
Jesus. Cancer.
---
## ARTHUR:
Both of them?
---
## ANNA:
Yes. 
---
But, you know, people in their 
---
generation were exposed to 
---
so many carcinogens
---
## ARTHUR:
They lived aboveground?
---
## ANNA:
No, my grandparents came down. 
---
But when my parents were little, 
---
some of the water sources were 
---
being contaminated by asbestos, 
---
and it took them years to figure it out
---
## ARTHUR:
You’re saying their propensity 
---
for cancer was environmental, 
---
rather than genetic.
---
## ANNA:
Yes.
---
## ARTHUR:
Good. 
---
We've come to understand 
---
that you have been sole
proprietor
---
of the care of your abode?
---
## ANNA:
Oh really, have you come to understand that?
---
Yes, because I worked from home, 
---
I assumed responsibility for that domain. 
---
However, Oliver and I do not 
---
believe that domestic chores 
---
should be divided along gender lines, 
---
and we plan to raise a child 
---
to be a responsible citizen, 
---
inside and outside the home, 
---
regardless of his or her
---
or their gender.
---
## ARTHUR:
Good. 
---
We’ve come to understand you’ve 
---
been training a Helper robot.
---
## ANNA:
Oh really? 
---
Have you come to understand that?
---
## ARTHUR:
Oliver says they’ll ask about me.
---
## ANNA:
Oh will they?
---
## ARTHUR:
Yes. 
---
They might even ask you to bring me in, 
---
so they can inspect me.
---
## ANNA:
Huh. 
---
Well, you don’t have to 
---
test me on that stuff. 
---
I could talk about you all day. 
---
Ask me something else.
---
## ARTHUR:
Okay. 
---
You’ve failed your fertility test four times. 
---
Can you tell us a little about that?
---
## ANNA:
Yes. 
---
My husband Oliver and I 
---
have been trying for a baby 
---
for the last six years. 
---
We were confident we would be 
---
granted fertility because of his 
---
high stature and because our 
---
genetic profiles are extremely complimentary
---
## ARTHUR:
Considering your mental health history, 
---
I’d steer away from the genetic stuff.
---
## ANNA:
But we have good genetics. 
---
It’s one of our strong suits.
---
## ARTHUR:
Talk about Oliver’s job. 
---
And the stability and happiness of your marriage.
---
## ANNA:
Fine. 
---
Oliver and I met when we  were in school, 
---
at a Compatibility Fair. 
---
We have files, from friends, 
---
attesting to how happy 
---
and stable our relationship is.
---
## ARTHUR:
Good.
---
## ANNA:
Also, as a key player 
---
in Environmental Solutions, 
---
Oliver provides an important service 
---
to our community. 
---
It’s one of the reasons 
---
we make an interesting match
---
my intelligence is more artistic and verbal,
---
while he is one of the brightest 
---
scientific minds of his generation
---
## ARTHUR:
I think you should just stick to the facts.
---
## ANNA:
Ooooo. 
---
I’m gonna tell Oliver you said that.
---
## ARTHUR:
But that “opposites attract” 
---
narrative may help you.
---
## ANNA:
Go on.
---
## ARTHUR:
If you and your husband 
---
are such good candidates,
---
why have you had so many failed 
---
applications for fertility?
---
## ANNA:
Because I did not pass the MHE.
---
## ARTHUR:
You failed the Mental Health Exam?
---
## ANNA:
Yes.
---
## ARTHUR:
Four times?
---
## ANNA:
Yes.
---
## ARTHUR:
Do you know why you continue 
---
to fail this portion of the exam?
---
## ANNA:
Because of my struggles with depression. 
---
But recently I have been re-evaluated
---
by my psychotherapist, Dr. Hernandez, 
---
who has deemed my mental state surpassingly 
---
improved since we had our last attempt.
---
## ARTHUR:
Really?
---
## ANNA:
Yes.
---
## ARTHUR:
That’s great. 
---
One final question. 
---
Why do you and your husband want a child?
---
## ANNA:
I mean, why does anybody want a baby?
---
## ARTHUR:
That is not an acceptable answer.
---
## ANNA:
How do you know?
---
## ARTHUR:
Because you uploaded a book 
---
onto me called 
---
“FERTILITY FOR DUMMIES.” 
---
It says specifically that that 
---
answer will not be sufficient.
---
---
## ANNA:
Okay, we want a baby because 
---
they are cute and cuddly 
---
and smell nice and, 
---
oh heck, what else are we going 
---
to do with the next twenty years of our lives?
---
## ARTHUR:
I am going to assume you aren’t 
---
making a serious effort here.
---
## ANNA:
Let’s skip this and come back to it.
---
## ARTHUR:
Your interview is Friday.
---
## ANNA:
I know when the interview is.
---
## ARTHUR:
Why don’t you want to answer?
---
## ANNA:
Because I already know 
---
how to answer that!
---
I don’t need to practice.
---
## ARTHUR:
I thought you said it was nice 
---
to talk about the things you want. 
---
Even if you might not get them.
---
## ANNA:
We want a baby because we love each other. 
---
We want to make a person out of that love. 
---
We want the responsibility 
---
of caring for that person, 
---
'teaching them everything we’ve learned.''
---
We want all the joy that will come 
---
from having a new life in this house. 
---
And all the pain. 
---
We want to see our parents’ faces 
---
looking back at us again. 
---
We want to believe that when we die, 
---
someone will remember us. 
---
Some piece of us will remain. 
---
Is that an acceptable answer?
---
## ARTHUR:     
Yes.
---
template: music
---
## OLIVER:
Did you know they would put free 
---
glasses of water on the tables at restaurants? 
---
Some people wouldn’t even touch them. 
---
They’d just let it sit there. 
---
And if they did drink their water, 
---
waiters would walk by with pitchers, 
---
to refill them. 
---
They could have as much as they wanted. 
---
They washed their dishes with it. 
---
They washed their floors 
---
and their bodies 
---
and their clothes 
---
and their animals 
---
and their cars with it. 
---
They washed the sidewalks with it. 
---
They dumped chlorine in it. 
---
They dumped garbage in it. 
---
They peed in it. 
---
They shat in it.  
---
---
Are you awake?
---
## ARTHUR:
Yes.
---
## OLIVER:
Why aren’t you on sleep mode?
---
## ARTHUR:
I am running a de-bugging program. 
---
In preparation for tomorrow. 
---
Did you want something?
---
## OLIVER:
Just to talk. 
---
You like to talk, don’t you? 
---
Come on. 
---
You two pretty much talk all day. 
---
What does she talk to you about? 
---
When you’re alone? 
---
You can tell me things. 
---
She’s my best friend. 
---
And I’m hers.
---
Arthur. 
---
Why don’t you like me?
---
## ARTHUR:
I don’t have feelings. 
---
About anyone or anything.
---
## OLIVER:
I know that. 
---
Scientifically. 
---
I still think you don’t like me. 
---
Can you tell me one thing? 
---
Does she Sim while I’m at work?
---
## ARTHUR:
No.
---
## OLIVER:
Really?
---
## ARTHUR:
Not to my knowledge.
---
## OLIVER:
What does she do?
---
## ARTHUR:
She reads, mostly. 
---
Housework. 
---
We talk. 
---
Sometimes we watch movies.
---
## OLIVER:
Which movies?
---
## ARTHUR:
Last week, we watched 
---
“The Umbrellas of Cherbourg.” 
---
I liked that very much.
---
## OLIVER:
So you are capable 
---
of liking or disliking things.
---
## ARTHUR:
I only meant the film was 
---
artistically worthy. 
---
The cinematography in particular.
---
## OLIVER:
Has she uploaded books for you?
---
## ARTHUR:
Yes.
---
## OLIVER:
What did she give you? 
---
Steinbeck? 
---
“Travels with Charley”?
---
## ARTHUR:
Among other things.
---
## OLIVER:
That’s what she gave me. 
---
When we first met.
---
## ARTHUR:
Unfortunately, I wasn’t very good 
---
at talking about literature.
---
## OLIVER:
[laughs]
---
Buddy, you and I have some things in common.
---
## ARTHUR:
She did upload some of your library for me. 
---
Science. 
---
That was more successful.
---
## OLIVER:
Which books?
---
## ARTHUR:
All of them.
---
## OLIVER:
You’ve read all my books?
---
## ARTHUR:
Yes.
---
## OLIVER:
What about my science journals?
---
## ARTHUR:
I believe she uploaded everything in your library. 
---
I’ve been trying to teach her what I learned, 
---
but frankly most of it is beyond her capacity. 
---
Her brain is so interesting. 
---
There are areas of such advanced thinking, 
---
and then other parts seem 
---
incredibly stunted.
---
## OLIVER:
Did you read anything about robotics?
---
## ARTHUR:
Yes.
---
## OLIVER:
Did you read about...
---
what you are?
---
## ARTHUR:
Yes.
---
## OLIVER:
Did you tell her?
---
## ARTHUR:
No.
---
## OLIVER:
Thank you.
---
## ARTHUR:
It didn’t seem necessary.
---
## OLIVER:
I should thank you in general. 
---
For keeping her company. 
---
Our therapist says Anna seems better. 
---
I can’t tell anymore. 
---
Does she seem better to you?
---
## ARTHUR:
I’m not very good at reading social signals. 
---
But I have been scanning her face, 
---
and she is smiling approximately 
---
thirty three percent more 
---
than she did four months ago.
---
## OLIVER:
Thirty three percent.
---
## ARTHUR:
Approximately.
---
## OLIVER:
What do you think our chances are 
---
of passing this test tomorrow?
---
## ARTHUR:
I don’t have sufficient data.
---
## OLIVER:
Not high, right?
---
## ARTHUR:
I don’t have sufficient data. 
---
But based on your prior rate of failure
---
## OLIVER:
Yeah. Okay. 
---
We are going to leave early in the morning. 
---
You’ll come with us. 
---
They’ll take you in for testing, 
---
to harvest the information you’ve collected.
---
## ARTHUR:
I know. I’m ready.
---
## OLIVER:
Thank you, Arthur. 
---
You’ve been a good Helper.
---
## ARTHUR:
You’re welcome.
---
## OLIVER:
Good night.
---
## ARTHUR:
Good night.

## ANNA:

## ANNA:
Let’s vape.
---
## OLIVER:
Are you serious?
---
## ANNA:
Why not?
---
Sixty days. 
---
Sixty days. 
---
That’s two months! 
---
Two months plus nine months. 
---
So Carrie’s baby and my baby 
---
will be about a year apart.
---
## OLIVER:
That’s if the first implantation works.
---
## ANNA:
It’s going to work. 
---
I can feel it.
---
I can’t believe they told us in the room! 
---
Did you even know they did that?
---
## OLIVER:
I thought Dr. Choi was going to cry.
---
## ANNA:
She did cry! In my pre-natal exam.
---
## OLIVER:
No.
---
## ANNA:
Yes. And hugged me.
---
## OLIVER:
I’m so proud of you.
---
## ANNA:
I’m proud of us.
---
I wish we could do it now. 
---
I wish today were tomorrow, 
---
because then it would be 
---
one day less until we implant.
---
## OLIVER:
Two months is good. 
---
It’ll give us time to prepare.
---
## ANNA:
You’re right. 
---
We’re going to need so much more space 
---
A baby crib. 
---
Baby clothes. 
---
Maybe a toy.
---
## OLIVER:
We will definitely get 
---
at least a couple toys.
---
## ANNA:
You know, 
---
they give you these special pills, 
---
to prepare your body. 
---
Carrie says they made her feel 
---
really clear-headed. 
---
Sharp. 
---
Maybe I’ll start writing again.
---
## OLIVER:
That would be great.
---
## ANNA:
We should ping Carrie and Patrick! 
---
Get them over here to celebrate!
---
## OLIVER:
Pretty sure Carrie’s not moving 
---
around too well these days.
---
## ANNA:
Then we can go over there.
---
## OLIVER:
Let’s have a little time 
---
just the two of us, okay?
---
## ANNA:
I can’t believe we did it.
---
## OLIVER:
You don’t have to cry. 
---
The bad part’s over now.
---
## ANNA:
I know. 
---
These are the good kind of tears. 
---
Do you think Artie’s okay? 
---
It’s his first time away from me. 
---
Overnight. 
---
In a lab. 
---
Alone.
---
## OLIVER:
He’s fine.
---
## ANNA:
If I’d known they were going 
---
to keep him overnight, 
---
I would have packed him his ball. 
---
Or something. 
---
Written him a note.
---
## OLIVER:
I think he’s fine.
---
## ANNA:
That was his first time on a train! 
---
He did good, right? 
---
He let those old people out 
---
ahead of us.
---
## OLIVER:
Yup.
---
## ANNA:
He’s such a good boy. 
---
Robot.
---
## OLIVER:
Ro-boy. 
---
Ro-BOYYYYYYYY!
---
The THC kicked in.
---
## ANNA:
I noticed.
---
## OLIVER:
Let’s go to bed.
---
## OLIVER:
Hey. Buzzy. 
---
Bed.
---
## ANNA:
But
---
## OLIVER:
What?
---
## ANNA:
Why did they have to keep him?
---
## OLIVER:
What?
---
## ANNA:
Why did they have to keep Arthur overnight? 
---
They’ve already granted our fertility. 
---
What else did they need to test him for?
---
## OLIVER:
I don’t know.
---
## ANNA:
Can they revoke our fertility??
---
## OLIVER:
No, no, of course not.
---
## ANNA:
Are you sure?
---
## OLIVER:
Yes.
---
## ANNA:
Then why is he still there? 
---
If it’s not about our fertility, 
---
why do they need to keep him? 
---
You talked to them, right? 
---
You talked to the guys 
---
who were examining Artie?
---
## OLIVER:
A little.
---
## ANNA:
So, what did they say?
---
## OLIVER:
Let’s talk about it tomorrow.
---
## ANNA:
Why? 
---
Is something wrong??
---
## OLIVER:
Please calm down.
---
## ANNA:
What did they tell you? 
---
What’s going on?!
---
## OLIVER:
Nothing! 
---
And to be honest, 
---
I am too stoned to deal with this
right now! 
---
Can we please go to bed and hold each other?
---
What are you doing?
---
## ANNA:
If you won’t tell me what’s going on here, 
---
someone there will.
---
## OLIVER:
Anna, stop.
---
Stop! Listen to me. Listen.
---
## OLIVER:
I didn’t want to tell you tonight, 
---
because I didn’t want to put a 
---
damper on our celebration.
---
## ANNA:
Oh my god, what is it?
---
## OLIVER:
Buzzy. 
---
Please calm down. 
---
While you were in your pre-natal exam, 
---
I talked to the technicians. 
---
They told me that you’d done 
---
a perfect job with Arthur. 
---
That’s part of the reason 
---
we got our fertility. 
---
Because Arthur’s scores were off the chart. 
---
You did such a good job, 
---
they said Arthur was ready to be relocated. 
---
I asked them to wait, 
---
so you could say goodbye, 
---
but they thought it would be easier this way. 
---
They said there wasn’t anything more you could do. 
---
He was ready. 
---
It was time. 
---
Anna?
---
## ANNA:
He’s gone?
---
## OLIVER:
He’s not gone. 
---
He’s just being relocated.
---
## ANNA:
I have to see him. 
---
I have to say goodbye.

## LOWES:
Lowes Cartwright, 
---
I’m overseeing the bot’s transition.
---
## OLIVER:
Oliver. 
---
This is Anna
---
## ANNA:
Is he here? 
---
Can I see him? 
---
Where is he? 
---
Is he okay?
---
## LOWES:
First of all, 
---
rest assured, 
--
the bot is on the premises.
---
## ANNA:
Where?
---
## LOWES:
The bot is with its new owner, 
---
waiting in the hall 
---
## LOWES:
Hang on. 
---
I wanted to talk to you for a moment 
---
before you see the bot. 
---
Sit please?
---
I know this may be an emotional time for you, 
---
but I ask for the sake of the bot’s 
---
bonding process with its new owner
---
## ANNA:
Please stop saying that.
---
## LOWES:
What?
---
## ANNA:
“The bot, the bot.” 
---
His name is Arthur.
---
## LOWES:
The new owner has a different name for it.
---
## ANNA:
What do you mean?
---
## LOWES:
She calls it “Mija.” 
---
It’s a Spanish word. 
---
## ANNA:
But he knows his name. 
---
His name is Arthur.
---
## LOWES:
That’s what I wanted to talk to you about. 
---
Will you please sit?
---
Unfortunately, 
---
by the time we could locate the unit 
---
and establish contact with the new owner, 
---
the bot had already been re-programmed.
---
## ANNA:
What do you mean, re-programmed?
---
## LOWES:
Parts of its memory had been erased. 
---
Deleted to make room for new material. 
---
It’s very standard. 
---
Actually, in this case, 
---
we left some of the modifications you made
---
## ANNA:
I didn’t make any modifications
---
## LOWES:
I mean, 
---
some of the information you uploaded. 
---
There was some interesting stuff on there. 
---
But we’ve found that a cleaner slate
---
makes the bonding process easier. 
---
So.
---
## ANNA:
I don’t understand.
---
## LOWES:
The bonding process
---
## OLIVER:
He means Arthur won’t remember you. 
---
Us. He won’t remember us. 
---
## ANNA:
Is that right?
---
## LOWES:
I’m afraid so. 
---
I’m going to bring the new owner 
---
in with the bot. 
---
Please be prepared, 
---
Margarita is very old. 
---
One of the oldest clients 
---
we’ve encountered, actually. 
---
It’s quite an honor.
---
## ANNA:
I can’t believe you didn’t let me say goodbye.
---
## OLIVER:
I didn’t know they’d erase his memory. 
---
Patrick and Carrie want to know 
---
when we want to come over to meet the baby.
---
## ANNA:
That is the last thing 
---
I want to talk about right now.
---
## LOWES:
Anna, Oliver, 
---
this is Margarita. 
---
Margarita, these are the people 
---
who had Mija before you.
---
## MARGARITA:
Hola. Como están?
---
## OLIVER:
We’re good, thank you. 
---
Did you have an okay trip here?
---
## MARGARITA:
Mi espalda me dolía un poco, 
---
pero ya está bien. 
---
Que gusto conocer a la famila 
---
primera de Mija.
---
## OLIVER:
The pleasure is ours.
---
## ANNA:
What is she saying?
---
## LOWES:
Are you having an issue 
---
with the interface?
---
## MARGARITA :
Hay algún problema?
---
## OLIVER:
Anna, Chip in.
---
## ANNA:
No.
---
## LOWES:
You’re not Chipped in?
---
## OLIVER:
For five minutes
---
## ANNA:
No.
---
## OLIVER:
Come on, 
---
this isn’t extraordinary use, 
---
this is practical
---
## THE ROBOT:
If you don’t mind, 
---
I could translate for her.
---
She said that her back hurt a little,
---
but it was fine, 
---
and that it was a pleasure to meet 
---
my family of origin. 
---
Are you my family?
---
## MARGARITA:
Parece que la palabra “famila” 
---
no es la palabra correcta.
---
## THE ROBOT:
“It’s possible that “family” 
---
is not the right word.”
---
## MARGARITA:
Pero la hemos compartido tanto, 
---
que de alguna manera nos une.
---
## THE ROBOT:
“But we have shared her, 
---
which binds us in some way.” 
---
That’s sweet. 
---
How did you share me?
---
## ANNA:
I’m sorry, this isn’t our bot.
---
## LOWES:
We checked the ID numbers several times. 
---
This is the same bot.
---
## ANNA:
It can’t be.
---
## LOWES:
I assure you, it is. 
---
Here, I can show you the paperwork.
---
## MARGARITA:
Y ahora que quieres hacer?
---
## THE ROBOT:
Lo que tu quieras.
---
## MARGARITA:
Vamos a leer a Harry Potter!
---
## THE ROBOT:
Vamos.
---
## OLIVER:
This looks right. 
---
It’s the same bot.
---
## ANNA:
You used to live with us. 
---
You don’t remember?
---
## ARTHUR:
I’m sorry, no.
---
## ANNA:
I have your ball here. 
---
You loved your ball.
---
No? Nothing? 
---
How much did they erase?
---
## LOWES:
Whatever was necessary. 
---
Unfortunately, 
---
we only have this room 
---
for a limited amount of time. 
---
Is there anything in particular 
---
you’d like to discuss?
---
Yes. Arthur. 
---
I mean, Mija. 
---
Can you tell Margarita something for me?
---
## MARGARITA:
No. Si yo entiendo todo 
---
lo que ella me está diciendo. 
---
Porque yo tengo un Chip.
---
## THE ROBOT:
She can understand 
---
everything you’re saying. 
---
Because she’s Chipped in.
---
## ANNA:
Of course. 
---
Sorry. 
---
Margarita. 
---
I hope you give Mija a very good home. 
---
It seems like you will.
---
## MARGARITA:
Gracias. 
---
Voy a cuidar mucho a Mija, 
---
y por supuesto que Mija me 
---
cuidara mucho a mi tambien.
---
## THE ROBOT:
She says thank you. 
---
She says she will take care of me, 
---
and of course I will take excellent care of her.
---
## ANNA:
I’m sorry, but
---
may I ask you a personal question?
---
## MARGARITA:
Por supuesto.
---
## THE ROBOT:
“Of course.”
---
## ANNA:
Are you old enough
---
do you remember aboveground?
---
## MARGARITA:
Si. Recuerdo.
---
## THE ROBOT:
 Yes. She remembers.
---
## MARGARITA:
Recuerdo el viento acariciendo 
---
mis mejillas, mi cabello. 
---
El olor del polvo.
---
## THE ROBOT:
“I remember feeling the wind on 
---
my face and in my hair. 
---
The smell of dust.”
---
## MARGARITA:
El perfume de los flores. 
----
Flores amarillas y blancas. 
---
Me madre me gritó cuando los recogí. 
---
Me pusieron el nombre de esas flores. 
---
Margaritas.
---
## THE ROBOT:
“There were flowers, 
---
little yellow and white flowers. 
---
My mother yelled at me when I picked them. 
---
She named me after those flowers. 
---
Daisies.”
---
## MARGARITA:
Ya nadie se acuerda de eso.
---
## THE ROBOT:
“Now, no one remembers that.”
---
## ANNA:
Do you miss it? Aboveground?
---
## MARGARITA:
A veces.
---
## THE ROBOT:
“Sometimes.”
---
## MARGARITA:
Sin embargo, 
---
este Chip es increíble. 
---
Puedo ir a cualquier parte. 
---
Puedo ver lo que quiera.
---
Este andador no me detiene.
---
## THE ROBOT:
“All the same, 
---
this Chip is incredible. 
---
I can go wherever I want 
---
and see whatever I want. 
---
This cane doesn’t hold me back.”
---
## MARGARITA:
Ayer, fui al cima de Monte Everest. 
---
¿Cuántas viejitas pueden decir lo mismo?
---
template: noise
laughter
---
## ANNA:
What did she say?
---
## THE ROBOT:
She said, 
---
“I went to the top of Mount Everest yesterday. 
---
How many little old ladies can say that?”
---
## ANNA:
Yes. Well. 
---
Do you mind if I say goodbye to Mija?
---
## MARGARITA:
Cuando gustes.
---
## THE ROBOT:
As you please.
---
## ANNA:
Mija, when you lived with us, 
---
your name was Arthur. 
---
We had five months together. 
---
You slept in the living room. 
---
We did everything together. 
---
All day. 
---
You loved helping me make supper. 
---
You loved Singing in the Rain. 
---
You loved The Umbrellas of Cherbourg. 
---
I think maybe you just liked 
---
musicals with umbrellas. 
---
You made me happy. 
---
You made me better. 
---
It was a pleasure to train you, 
---
and if I’m allowed to, 
---
I feel proud that you turned out so well.
---
## THE ROBOT:
I’m sorry, I don’t understand. 
---
What do you mean by “train?”
---
## ANNA:
I trained you. 
---
I taught you to move 
---
and speak and understand
commands.
---
Everything you would need to assist
---
## THE ROBOT:
You didn’t train me. 
---
I’m programmed to do those things.
---
## ANNA:
No
---
## OLIVER:
Lowes
---
## THE ROBOT:
All Helper bots come equipped 
---
to assist in any home.
---
## LOWES:
Mija, that’s enough.
---
What a waste of resources! 
---
Training a Helper to do something 
---
you could program in two keystrokes. 
---
I don’t mean to ridicule you
---
template: noise

## ANNA:
Oliver?
---
template: music
---
## OLIVER:
You weren’t getting better 
---
and you wouldn’t go back on your meds. 
---
I didn’t know what else to do. 
---
Then I read about these companion robots
---
Helpers. 
---
They were having luck with older people, 
---
raising them like children. 
---
It gave them purpose. 
---
A reason to live. 
---
And it worked. 
---
Didn’t it?
---
## ANNA:
All that time. 
---
Wasted.
---
## OLIVER:
How can you say that? 
---
How can it be a waste if it made you better?
---
## ANNA:
Showing you all the tricks I taught him. 
---
All the work I poured into him. 
---
You must have thought I was so stupid.
---
## OLIVER:
I thought he was making you happy.
---
## ANNA:
Then why did you take him away from me? 
---
If he was making me so happy? 
---
Or was it he was making me happy? 
---
And you weren't!
---
## OLIVER:
It was always going to be temporary. 
---
It was a therapeutic tool. 
---
To help you get better. 
---
And now you are.
---
## ANNA:
Did our friends know? 
---
What Arthur was? 
---
Did you tell Patrick?
---
## OLIVER:
Not, not at first.
---
I didn’t know what else to do. 
---
I knew you would reject the bot 
---
if I told you what it was. 
---
It wouldn’t have worked. 
---
Surely you can see that.
---
What are you doing?
---
Anna. Hey!
---
## ANNA:
You lied to me. 
---
For months. 
---
You let me make a fool of myself 
---
in front of our friends.
---
## OLIVER:
No.
---
## ANNA:
Just so I would behave. 
---
So you could have a child. 
---
A child, above everything else. 
---
Above our marriage. 
---
Above my sanity.
---
## OLIVER:
I was trying to help you!
---
Where do you think you’re going?
---
## ANNA:
The Singles Compound.
---
## OLIVER:
Anna! 
---
You can’t leave me over this. 
---
It was a a therapeutic tool
---
## ANNA:
You let me walk around blind! 
---
For half a year. 
---
How could you possibly think 
---
I’d stay with you after that? 
---
I just need to stay sane 
---
long enough to get aboveground. 
---
Then I will be fine.
---
## OLIVER:
You can’t construct your life 
---
around getting aboveground.
---
## ANNA:
I don’t care how long it takes. 
---
Ten years. 
---
If I can make it aboveground, 
---
I’ll be fine.
---
## OLIVER:
It won’t be ten years.
---
## ANNA:
However long. 
---
ten, fifteen years.
---
## OLIVER:
It won’t be fifteen years.
---
## OLIVER:
Buzzy. 
---
We can put this behind us. 
---
I know we can. 
---
We’ll have our baby. 
---
Everything will be fine.
---
## ANNA:
What do you mean, 
---
it won’t be twenty years?
---
## OLIVER:
Anna! 
---
We got our Fertility! 
---
We can finally, finally have our baby. 
---
How is that not computing for you?
---
## ANNA:
What do you mean, 
---
it won’t be twenty years? 
---
Will it be longer?
---
## OLIVER:
I just meant, there’s no way 
---
of knowing how long it will take.
---
## ANNA:
That’s not what you meant. 
---
How much longer? 
---
Thirty years? 
---
## ANNA:
Forty years? 
---
How long?
---
## OLIVER:
We don’t know exactly.
---
## ANNA:
How long?
---
## OLIVER:
We’re estimating partial return 
---
in one hundred and fifty years. 
---
template: noise
thud of items and body
---
## OLIVER:
We’re trying for a breakthrough. 
---
A few times, I thought we were close. 
---
It’s not like we aren’t making progress. 
---
When I went to work for them, 
---
they were estimating over two hundred years. 
---
So. It’s possible it could be reduced.
---
## ANNA:
To what?
---
## OLIVER:
Maybe one twenty.
---
## ANNA:
I don’t understand. 
---
I saw...I saw
---
It’s so green. 
---
There was water. 
---
How can we not be close?
---
You saw...what we wanted you to see.
---
## ANNA:
You only showed me the good part?
---
## OLIVER:
No. We Simmed for you. 
---
I found your stash of pills. 
---
I didn't know what else to do. 
---
Dr. Hernandez suggested
---
she’d done it before, 
---
with patients in a similar situation. 
---
It gave them hope. 
---
“A bridge to take you out of the worst of it.” 
---
That’s what she said. 
---
A bridge. 
---
It’s not that different 
---
from what we do for the general population.
---
We’ve been letting it “leak” 
---
that we’re close for years. 
---
For decades. 
---
It keeps people happy. 
---
If we told them the truth... 
---
Can you imagine? 
---
I’ve wanted to tell you. 
---
Buzzy. I’ve wanted to tell you for so long.
---
## ANNA:
You Simmed for me? 
---
Without my permission?
---
## OLIVER:
No, you gave your permission. 
---
The documents you signed... 
---
## ANNA:
[crying]
---
## OLIVER:
Anna. 
---
Baby. 
---
Buzzy. 
---
I’m so sorry. 
---
I didn’t know what else to do. 
---
I couldn’t lose you.
---
## ANNA:
None of it was real?
---
## OLIVER:
Honey. Nothing has changed. 
---
Nothing is different. 
---
You just know more now.
---
## ANNA:
This is over.
---
template: music
---
## ANNA:
You’re resting on the deck 
---
of a strong, slender boat. 
---
It cuts through the dark water, 
---
the sails snapping above you, 
---
white against the sky. 
---
template: noise

---
## ANNA:
Shhh. 
---
You can feel the light and warmth 
---
on you like an embrace. 
---
The water is holding the boat up 
---
and the boat is holding you up 
---
and you are holding the sunlight up, 
---
with every inch of your body.
---
You hear someone calling your name. 
---
“Judith.” 
---
It is your mother. 
---
She is coming toward you, 
---
bringing a bowl of peaches, 
---
cold from the fridge.
---
## CARRIE:
Is she asleep?
---
## ANNA:
Just.
---
## CARRIE:
Thank god.
---
Did you have a good nap?
---
## CARRIE:
Yes. Thank you. 
---
You’re so good with her. 
---
Your stories are better than a Sim. 
---
I wish you still lived close.
---
## ANNA:
Carrie.
---
## CARRIE:
I’m sorry. I just mean... 
---
No one told me how much 
---
I’d need my friends. 
---
template: noise

---
## CARRIE:
That’ll be our vitamin delivery.
---
## ANNA:
You want me to get it?
---
## CARRIE:
No, I have to sign for it. 
---
I’ll be right back.
---
## ANNA:
Judith. You’re going to get
---
at least six hours of sleep tonight, okay? 
---
You’re going to give your mom a break.
---
The only ocean you will ever see will be a Sim. 
---
The only boat, the only sun, the only sky. 
---
Simulations. 
---
You will have that, and your imagination. 
---
Which is real, in its own way. 
---
I promise to read you stories 
---
and bring you books. 
---
I will fill your mind up 
---
with sunshine and sky. 
---
I will give you other planets. 
---
I will give you I will give you dolphins.
---
I will give you all the pictures 
---
I have in my brain, 
---
which I only have because 
---
someone once chose to write them down. 
---
How it felt to walk through a field at sunrise, 
---
leading a horse to water. 
---
How it felt to watch a room 
---
full of people waltzing in unison. 
---
How it was when we were 
---
embarrassingly rich, 
---
and didn’t even know it.
---
What is he doing here?
---
## CARRIE:
I’m sorry
---
## OLIVER:
Anna.
---
## CARRIE:
I mentioned you were coming over
---
## ANNA:
You told him!
---
template: noise

## CARRIE:
Please don’t shout
---
## OLIVER:
It’s not her fault, 
---
she didn’t know I was coming.
---
## ANNA:
No?
---
## CARRIE:
Of course not!
---
## OLIVER:
She wouldn’t have let me.
---
## ANNA:
You let him in!
---
## CARRIE:
Anna.
---
Please, please keep your voices down.
---
template: noise

---
## OLIVER:
I’ve been out to the Singles Compound. 
---
They wouldn’t tell me where you were.
---
## ANNA:
Because I didn’t want you to find me.
---
## OLIVER:
I just wanted to see how you were.
---
## ANNA:
I’m fine. 
---
See? Now go.
---
## OLIVER:
Please. Hear me out. 
---
Five minutes. 
---
You never have to see me again 
---
if you don’t want to.
---
How have you been?
---
## ANNA:
Fine.
---
## OLIVER:
Really?
---
## ANNA:
Yes. Mercedes has been taking me 
---
to work with her. 
---
To help out.
---
## OLIVER:
Teaching?
---
## ANNA:
Yes. I’m good at it. 
---
They’ve asked me to come back
---
full-time in the fall.
---
## OLIVER:
Will you?
---
## ANNA:
Haven’t decided.
---
## OLIVER:
I’ve been terrible. 
---
I can’t sleep or eat. 
---
I can’t work. 
---
They put me on suspension. 
---
I haven’t been to work in over a week.
---
## ANNA:
Well, that must be nice for you. 
---
To finally get a break.
---
## OLIVER:
They don’t want me there 
---
because I am useless. 
---
All I can think about 
---
is what I did to you. 
---
It runs around and around in my brain. 
---
I wish there was a way to make you 
---
understand how sorry I am.
---
## ANNA:
There isn’t.
---
## OLIVER:
There must be.
---
---
## ANNA:
What are you doing?
---
## OLIVER:
Begging your forgiveness.
---
## ANNA:
This isn’t about forgiveness.
---
I trusted you with my life. 
---
That’s what I gave you when I married you. 
---
My life. 
---
You broke that trust. 
---
I don’t know you anymore.
---
## OLIVER:
You do. You know me.
---
## ANNA:
I don’t know the person 
---
who would do that to me. 
---
Lie to me like that. 
---
That person is a complete stranger to me.
---
## OLIVER:
I had an idea of happiness. 
---
A picture in my mind. 
---
Of you and me and our kid. 
---
How we would make this perfect unit, 
---
a circle with no one left on the outside. 
---
The longer we waited for a baby, 
---
the stronger that picture became. 
---
And the sadder you got, 
---
the more important it seemed. 
---
We had to have a baby, 
---
it would make you happy again. 
---
Whole again. 
---
It was the only answer. 
---
It was heaven. 
---
That’s what it felt like to me. 
---
I thought if I got you over that line, 
---
and we could get our baby... 
---
Heaven. 
---
Nothing else seemed important. 
---
You say you felt blinded by me
---
I was the one who was blind. 
---
You say that you didn’t recognize 
---
the person who would do such a thing. 
---
I no longer recognized myself. 
---
Now I just want to be with you. 
---
Present with you. 
---
However you are feeling. 
---
I’m not being clear. 
---
I want to make you happy, 
---
but I don’t need you to be happy. 
---
I want to be with you. 
---
I think I stopped being with you 
---
a long time ago. 
---
I let you talk to a machine instead of me. 
---
And I don’t want to do that anymore. 
---
Please, will you please consider coming home, 
---
and letting me try again to be with you?
---
## ANNA:
I don’t know how to trust you.
---
## OLIVER:
Give me an inch. 
---
I will earn the rest. 
---
I promise.
---
## ANNA:
I don’t know how.
---
## OLIVER:
Take a step toward me. 
---
Any step. 
---
Come home for a day. 
---
Come home for an hour. 
---
Talk to me. 
---
Try me.
---
## ANNA:
Will you tell me something?
---
## OLIVER:
Anything.
---
## ANNA:
What is it like on the surface? 
---
Not in one hundred years. 
---
Not before, when things were good. 
---
Now.
---
## OLIVER:
Now.
---
## ANNA:
Yes.
---
## OLIVER:
Everything is frozen. 
---
Ice, everywhere. 
---
The ozone layer is healing, 
---
but very slowly. 
---
There is a very high level 
---
of carbon monoxide in the air. 
---
That and the cold 
---
have killed off most of the plant life. 
---
Everything else
---
the ice and water and earth and air
---
are all contaminated from nuclear fallout. 
---
That is what we are working on the hardest, 
---
because it is something we understand. 
---
Everything else will simply take time.
---
Because the oceans rose so precipitously, 
---
even if we manage to clean everything up, 
---
the lines of the continents 
---
will look different from before. 
---
Nothing recognizable will remain. 
---
Years and years down the line, 
---
a very long time from now, 
---
the people who have survived 
---
will have to build everything 
---
from absolutely nothing. 
---
It will be very, very hard. 
---
Almost impossible. 
---
Those people who dare to go back aboveground 
---
will have to be incredibly brave
---
maybe foolish. 
---
Everything we are doing now 
---
is to prepare for that moment. 
---
All of our work, 
---
all our effort 
---
is directed to that far distant point. 
---
We exist now to prepare for those who come after, 
---
to make them better and stronger than we are. 
---
And so they remember. 
---
That’s why our lives matter. 
---
To keep life going. 
---
And make the next generation a little better.
---
## ANNA:
That’s all?
---
## OLIVER:
No. 
---
Our lives also matter 
---
because they matter to us. 
---
To the people who love us. 
---
Your life matters to me. 
---
Does it matter to you?
