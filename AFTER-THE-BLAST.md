SETTING 
The near future
CHARACTERS 
Note: This world has been intentionally populated with an eye toward ethnic and
racial diversity. The cast should reflect that.
Anna: Female, thirties.
Oliver: Male, thirties.
Carrie: Female, twenties or thirties.
Patrick: Male, thirties.
Sam: Male, twenties to forties.
Lowes: Male, twenties or thirties. Double-cast with the actor voicing the Robot.
Margarita: Female. Seventies or older. Spanish speaking.
The Robot: Mechanical object/puppet. The Robot should be voiced and operated live,
as a puppet, rather than pre-recorded.

## OLIVER:
I’m sorry, but I have to ask: real or reproduction?
---
## SAM:
Smell.
---
## OLIVER:
Wow.
---
## SAM:
Nice, right?
---
## OLIVER:
Can’t fake that.
---
## SAM:
Well, they can Simulate it, but I don’t think it’s the same. 
---
## OLIVER:
It’s in great condition.
---
## SAM:
My mother’s father brought it down. Practically his entire Quota of Ephemera, he used on books. Not that I blame him.
---
## OLIVER:
My grandparents brought hard-drives full of photos. Pictures of the sky. The Grand Canyon. Seems silly now.
---
## SAM:
Lots of people brought photographs. It’s actually been enormously helpful for mapping. I’m in Cultural Collection, so.
---
## OLIVER:
No kidding. My friend Patrick works over there, in the Music Cache—
---
## SAM:
Patrick Maybill?
---
## OLIVER:
Yes!
---
## SAM:
He lives six units over from me. We commute together.
---
## OLIVER:
No kidding.

---
## SAM:
Sam Hakitano.
---
## OLIVER:
Oliver Erkenbrecker.
---
## SAM:
Oh, Oliver. Right. Patrick always—
---
## OLIVER:
Yup, raised together—“brothers” practically, if we can still use that word—
---
## SAM:
Well, I know actual brothers, so I guess it’s still applicable—
---
## OLIVER:
You know a multiple?
---
## SAM:
My friend Hakim has two boys.
---
## OLIVER:
No kidding.
---
## SAM:
He and his wife—you wouldn’t guess it from looking at them, believe me—but somehow, together: genetic jackpot. The strongest, healthiest, prettiest kids. The Council thought it was worth the investment.
---
## OLIVER:
Wow.
---
## SAM:
(Lowers his voice) There’s no official word, of course, but apparently Fertility’s been skewing low.
---
## OLIVER:
I hadn’t heard that.
---
## SAM:
Just by a couple points of a percentage point. But still. Hakim—he’s on the Census Board—he says they’re considering making it policy to grant multiples. Just to the most successful pairings, just to keep the numbers level. Can you imagine handling multiples?? In the size of our units? I mean, one already runs us ragged. Gloria. She’s three.
He pulls out an electronic Card (like a very slim iPhone) and shows it to Oliver.
---
## OLIVER:
Adorable.
---
## SAM:
Yeah, we think she’s pretty great. (Beat.) You been here before?
---
## OLIVER:
I’m buddies with a couple guys in Product Development, so. You?
---
## SAM:
We came here years ago, to fit my father for a leg. Artificial Solutions, man. Gave my dad a good eight years. Running around. What are you here for today, if you don’t mind me asking?

---
## OLIVER:
Just...dropping by.
---
## SAM:
Cool.
I’m sorry, but—you’re working on Inhabitation, right?
---
## OLIVER:
Environmental Solutions. Recruited me, first year of university.
---
## SAM:
Wow. Well. God bless. I know I’m not supposed to know anything about this, and you probably can’t... Patrick once said something about... That you had said...that the timeline looks...that we might be “upstairs” sooner than—
---
## OLIVER:
There is a lot to learn about what’s happening aboveground. And there’s obviously a ton of work left to do. But... We areoptimistic.
---
## SAM:
...Very optimistic?
This is only an estimate, of course.
---
## SAM:
Of course.
---
## OLIVER:
And this is not to be repeated.
---
## SAM:
Understood.
---
## OLIVER:
To anyone.
---
## SAM:
Yes.
---
## OLIVER:
We are estimatingpartial re-habitation in the next ten to fifteen years. 
---
## SAM:
That’s...that’s...

---
## OLIVER:
Not to be repeated, right? Not even to your wife.
---
## SAM:
Yes. Of course. But that’s great to hear. Especially from someone in the know.
So, what are you here for today? Another leg?
---
## SAM:
Ha, um, no... ...We’re getting a Helper? Have you heard about them?
---
## OLIVER:
Oh, um. Actually. That’s what—we’re getting one too.
---
## SAM:
Pretty cool to get them in Beta, right? I hear the wait list is super long.
---
## OLIVER:
Is this—will it be for Gloria?
---
## SAM:
No, my mom. With my dad gone, she’s pretty lonely.
---
## OLIVER:
You’re lucky you’ve still got a parent.
---
## SAM:
What about you?
---
## OLIVER:
No, my parents are long gone.
---
## SAM:
No—sorry—I meant, why are you getting a Helper?
---
## OLIVER:
Oh. Has Patrick told you about our situation?
---
## SAM:
I don’t think so.
---
## OLIVER:
My wife and I are still waiting to receive Fertility.
---
## SAM:
Oh. I’m sorry.
---
## OLIVER:
It’s okay. My wife is taking some time off work to prepare for our next application, but she’s kind of at loose ends. I thought this might help.
---
## SAM:
May I ask what attempt you’re on?
---
## OLIVER:
We completed our fourth last year.
---
## SAM:
Is it... I’m sorry, but we did have a slight hiccup on the Genetics ourselves—
---
## OLIVER:
Genetics aren’t the problem.
---
## SAM:
I’m sorry. I shouldn’t pry. (Silence.) We had to terminate our first attempt. Downs. Jenny and I fought to keep it. But, you know— “drain on resources” and all that.
---
## OLIVER:
I thought they’d eliminated the possibility of any chromosomal—
---
## SAM:
Look what happens with gender selection. We just got unlucky.
---
## OLIVER:
I’m so sorry.
---
## SAM:
And we didn’t find out until Jenny was twenty weeks along—
---
## OLIVER:
What a nightmare.
---
## SAM:
Yes. (Beat.) But we have Gloria now. So. All worth it. He smiles. Pause.
---
## OLIVER:
Anna—my wife. She’s always had kind of a hard... The Vitamin D deficiency has, for her, been, um, kind of debilitating? Of course, you can’t stay on pharmaceuticals if you want Fertility. So, she went off. And she seems fine, day to day. She eats. She makes jokes. But she can’t seem to get past the MHE.
---
## SAM:
That test is so outdated. Who can honestly say they are “happy” every single day?
---
## OLIVER:
I know! And it’s a vicious cycle—she doesn’t pass the Mental Health because she seems depressed, so we don’t receive our Fertility, which makes her...more depressed. (He laughs.) I mean, give her a kid: she’ll be happy. That’s what I wanna say to them: Don’t look at her sitting there, all nervous. Watch her in our unit, see how she is with our friends’ kids.
---
## SAM:
You still have one more chance, though, right?
---
## OLIVER:
Yes. Just the one.
---
## SAM:
Could you apply for an exemption?

---
## OLIVER:
I hope it doesn’t come to that.
---
## SAM:
I have a friend who was dealing with some mental health stuff, and Simulations really helped. Has your doctor prescribed anything like that...?
---
## OLIVER:
Actually—I know this might sound crazy, but we’re kind of Anti-Sim—
---
## SAM:
Oh, right, I think Patrick said something about—
---
## OLIVER:
I mean, we both have the Chip and everything—
---
## SAM:
I don’t think you can opt out anymore—
---
## OLIVER:
I’m pretty sure parents can still decide not to Chip—
---
## SAM:
They didn’t give us an option. Chipped Gloria at six months.
---
## OLIVER:
Oh. That’s changed then. Anna won’t like that.
---
## SAM:
But, without a Chip, how would you participate communally?
---
## OLIVER:
Right, we all rely on it. Anna and I just try to limit our use.
---
## SAM:
Some kind of a Luddite movement?
---
## OLIVER:
No, no, nothing like that. We just try to be conscious of how much—
---
## SAM:
Of course. We all have to set some kind of limit. Otherwise, you could get lost in it.
---
## OLIVER:
Completely. I mean, before Anna—she doesn’t like me to talk about it, but I went through a time when I was totally hooked.
---
## SAM:
I gotta say, though, with a kid? To get a little sleep? Being able to Simulate for her is a fucking godsend. And you know, make some memories. Last weekend we Simmed a Day At The Beach. It was incredible. We put on Suntan Lotion. Gloria made Sand Castles. We swam. I swear, the guys that design that stuff are the artists of our time. Every detail. Fish in the water, seaweed—
---
## OLIVER:
What kind of fish?
---
## SAM:
Little, silver—

---
## OLIVER:
Were they salt water, though? I mean, were they trying for accuracy, or was it more designed for pleasure?
---
## SAM:
You should try it, man. A couple hours a day won’t hurt you. 
---
## SAM:
Come on. You don’t ever Sim? Even at work? Even when you need a little—?
occasionally...
---
## SAM:
, you do.
---
## OLIVER:
But Anna hates it. Even little things. Standard things. I mean, we Sim with food, of course—
---
## SAM:
Well, you’d be crazy not to do that—
---
## OLIVER:
Right, but Anna’s point is, why voluntarily sign up for more unreality—
Samuel Hakitano. Samuel Hakitano. Room six. Your technician is waiting.
Hey, it was great meeting you.
---
## OLIVER:
Yeah, likewise.
---
## SAM:
We should compare notes down the line. About the Helpers.
---
## OLIVER:
Sure.
And when you get your Fertility, if you have any questions...
---
## OLIVER:
Thanks.

---
## SAM:
I’m telling you, once you have a kid, your wife will change her mind about Simulation. It’s great with Child Development. Plus, like I said. The sleep.
Sam smiles and walks off, down the hallway. Oliver watches him go.


Open.
It’s a Helper.
A what?
---
## OLIVER:
A Helper. The newest thing from Artificial Solutions. It’s a home-assistance robot. It’s in Beta.
---
## ANNA:
Why do we need a “Helper”?
---
## OLIVER:
We don’t. We’re going to train it. Teach it to be a companion. When we’re done, A.S. will give it to someone in need. Community service.
---
## ANNA:
They don’t come trained?
---
## OLIVER:
Apparently the Helpers do better if they are acclimated to a home first. We’ll have it for six months, a year, however long it takes to socialize it—
---
## ANNA:
it?
Hang on, they sent a video—A kind of safety, instructional thing...
---
## ANNA:
By “we,” you mean me.

---
## OLIVER:
What?
---
## ANNA:
“We’re going to train it.” You mean I will train it.
---
## OLIVER:
No. Come on. You know I love this stuff.
---
## ANNA:
You will go to work, and I will stay home and train this thing. That’s the idea, right? I don’t need you to fill up my time. My time is filled. I don’t need a hobby.
---
## OLIVER:
This isn’t a hobby.
---
## ANNA:
Take it back.
---
## OLIVER:
Will you look at the video?
---
## ANNA:
you take it back? How much did this thing cost?
---
## OLIVER:
It didn’t cost anything.
---
## ANNA:
Well, that can’t be true.
---
## OLIVER:
We are training it for someone else. It doesn’t cost us anything. Will you watch the video? Please?
Welcome to Artificial Solutions. The future is HERE.
---
## ANNA:
We’re going to miss waste collection—
---
## OLIVER:
Shhh. Watch.
---
## VOICE:
In life aboveground, canine mammals, commonly known as dogs, were trained to lead the sight-challenged.
They think we don’t know what are? Who is this video for?
---
## VOICE:
Although canine species are now sustained in Animal Sanctuary, these creatures are obviously no longer available for service use.

---
## VOICE:
With every year underground, more and more children are born without sight. Simulation is an asset, but the sight-challenged population has voiced a need for physical aid and companionship. To fill that need, we present: "The HELPER 1,3".
What can the HELPER do? Well, almost anything you teach it! Verbalization, Socialization, Game-Playing, Assistance in the Home. The more you put into your HELPER, the more it gives back. Enjoy the journey! The future...is HERE!
We’d be helping some kid, Buzzy. Or some little old lady.
---
## ANNA:
Where’s its sensor?
---
## OLIVER:
The whole thing acts as a sensor, I think. Hang on, I have to turn it on. 
---
## ANNA:
Turn it off.
Cooooooooooooooooool.
---
## ANNA:
Turn it off.
Oliver! Turn it off!
What?
---
## ANNA:
Take it back, I don’t want that thing in my house.
---
## OLIVER:
You’ve barely given it a chance.
---
## ANNA:
We tried it! I don’t like it! It’s creepy.

---
## OLIVER:
Buzzy. There is some lonely blind kid out there who spends all of his time with Simulations. You could be giving him a real companion. A friend.
---
## ANNA:
is not a friend! It is a 
---
## OLIVER:
That can be whatever you teach it to be. , Buzzy. can teach it. You can imprint it with all of your goodness, and your intelligence, and your humor. You can transform it.
---
## ANNA:
That sounds like the kind of experience people enjoy. 
---
## OLIVER:
Okay. We can return it.
---
## ANNA:
Thank you.
---
## OLIVER:
But what if this Helper goes to someone else, and that person is a sadist?
---
## ANNA:
Oliver—
---
## OLIVER:
Listen. What if that person somehow imparts his cruelty to this thing? You’d send a Robot with sadistic tendencies into some unsuspecting kid’s home?
---
## ANNA:
wouldn’t send it into anyone’s home. I don’t see how sitting around talking to a machine could help anyone.
---
## OLIVER:
Better than playing with your Chip all day.
---
## ANNA:
I don’t play with my Chip.
---
## OLIVER:
I meant the kid. Some blind kid, playing with his—
---
## ANNA:
You think I sit around secretly Simulating, while you’re at work?
---
## OLIVER:
No. But you are here alone, and when I ask what you did all day—
---
## ANNA:
You know what I do. I don’t want to bore you with a recitation.
---
## OLIVER:
You don’t bore me, you’re the one who’s bored—
---
## ANNA:
I clean our unit! I make you supper! I collect our waste!

---
## OLIVER:
Do you want to go back to work? (Beat.) I’m really asking.
---
## ANNA:
Writing puff pieces about how to best use your monthly water allotment just doesn’t seem that meaningful to me right now. Sorry.
---
## OLIVER:
We could find you a different kind of work.
---
## ANNA:
Nothing feels that meaningful right now.
---
## OLIVER:
You could go back on your meds. Just for a few months. It wouldn’t set our timeline back by much.
Anna shakes her head. Beat. Oliver goes to her.
---
## OLIVER:
Look. This would be a low stress activity, with a lot of variety—you’ll be teaching the Robot new things all the time. And by the time you finish training it, we will have gotten our Fertility.
---
## ANNA:
Right.
---
## OLIVER:
We will.Beat.
---
## ANNA:
Fine.
---
## OLIVER:
Fine?
---
## ANNA:
Yes. Fine. You’re foisting me off on a hunk of metal. Understood.
---
## OLIVER:
That is not what this is!
---
## ANNA:
I’ll pour all of my anxiety into this thing instead of bothering you, and then maybe you’ll have a sweet, docile wife again—
---
## OLIVER:
I’d hardly say you were ever docile—
---
## ANNA:
This is not boredom. I don’t feel this way because I don’t have enough to do. It’s like there is a hole in my chest. A dark, deep gaping hole. Does that sound like boredom to you?
---
## OLIVER:
No. But I don’t think it helps that you have so little occupying your time.
Beat.

---
## ANNA:
Do you know why so many kids need a robot to help them get around? Evolution. They were born in a hole, miles underground. Blindness is adaptation when you live in the dark.
---
## OLIVER:
We don’t live in the dark.
---
## ANNA:
We’re fucking moles. Any moment now, we’ll start growing whiskers. 
---
## OLIVER:
Whiskers.
---
## ANNA:
Everyone acts like I’m unsuitable for somehow, but it seems pretty to me to be depressed considering that our ancestors fucked up our ecology so we had to retreat We’re being buried alive.
---
## OLIVER:
No, we aren’t.
---
## ANNA:
What if we don’t have enough to sustain us?
---
## OLIVER:
That’s what Fertility Control is for.
---
## ANNA:
Oh, really? Is that what it’s for? I was What if our oxygen gardens fail? Or our water sources dry up?
---
## OLIVER:
The U.N. planned with all contingencies in mind.
---
## ANNA:
We haven’t heard from India in over a year.
---
## OLIVER:
Even if every colony in every country doesn’t survive, enough of the population will.
---
## ANNA:
I keep thinking about the people who got stuck up there.
---
## OLIVER:
Buzzy.
---
## ANNA:
Not worthy to Colonize. Redundant gene pool.
---
## OLIVER:
Please don’t.
---
## ANNA:
If I had been born a hundred years ago, there’s no way I would have been chosen. No appreciable skill. Physically weak. Serotonin-deficient. I would have died up there with the rest of them. Fried in the nuclear meltdowns or drowned in some tsunami. The final

excrement of our civilization. And you know what? I think I would have been better off.
I want to take you somewhere.
---
## ANNA:
I don’t want to go to the Civilization Center again. Artifacts make me sad.
---
## OLIVER:
I know. Listen. I’ve been talking with people at work. About our situation.
---
## ANNA:
Who? Who did you talk to?
---
## OLIVER:
Jordan and Tim. And Shiva.
---
## ANNA:
Shiva??
---
## OLIVER:
Please don’t be mad. I just told them a little about how you’ve been feeling. Your anxieties.
---
## ANNA:
Oh Jesus.
---
## OLIVER:
They understood. And they agreed that special arrangements might be made.
---
## ANNA:
What arrangements?
---
## OLIVER:
First you have to promise, you won’t tell anyone what I’m about to tell you.
---
## ANNA:
What is it?
---
## OLIVER:
Anna. Promise me.


This thing is . You’re so lucky. Patrick never brings anything new home. I’m always like, “You work in Cultural Collection. You’re surrounded by interesting shit. Steal something already.” How does it work?
---
## ANNA:
You have to activate it, apparently.
I’m sorry, we ran out of sweetener.
---
## CARRIE:
It’s okay. I’ll Sim it.
What?
---
## CARRIE:
Nothing. How are you?
---
## ANNA:
Fine. How are you?
---
## CARRIE:
Fine. How are 
---
## ANNA:
...
---
## CARRIE:
Good.
---
## ANNA:
You wanna sit?
---
## CARRIE:
Sure.
So?
---
## ANNA:

---
## CARRIE:
Nothing!

Carrie! 
---
## CARRIE:
What was it ?!
---
## ANNA:
What...was...what like?
---
## CARRIE:
YOU KNOW WHAT!
---
## ANNA:
Who told you??
---
## CARRIE:
Who do you think??
---
## ANNA:
Patrick??
---
## CARRIE:
Of course Patrick!
---
## ANNA:
Why would Ollie tell Patrick??
---
## CARRIE:
Do you think our husbands keep anything from each other?? I know
everything about Ollie. I have seen pictures of his poop.
---
## ANNA:
Ew. Ollie doesn’t tell me everything about Patrick. 
---
## CARRIE:
What does Patrick secretly want to name the baby?
---
## ANNA:
Peyton.
---
## CARRIE:
The name he talk about.
---
## ANNA:
...Peach Melba.
---
## CARRIE:
Exactly. Anna. You guys are family, okay? We’re not going to tell anyone. Who would we tell?
---
## ANNA:
You have to promise.
---
## CARRIE:
I promise.
---
## ANNA:
Seriously. If it gets out, Oliver could lose his job. Or worse. We signed non-disclosure forms.
---
## CARRIE:
I swear.

---
## ANNA:
Okay. The news is good. Very, very good.
---
## CARRIE:
Oh my god.
---
## ANNA:
You can’t tell anyone.
---
## CARRIE:
Did you take pictures?
---
## ANNA:
Of course not.
---
## CARRIE:
You went and you didn’t take any pictures?!
---
## ANNA:
Shhhh!
There’s no one here! What are you worried about?
---
## ANNA:
Just: be careful.
---
## CARRIE:
How could you not take pictures?
---
## ANNA:
If I took a picture and it got out...
---
## CARRIE:
Ugh. Fine. Tell me everything. Did you see animals?
---
## ANNA:
No.
---
## CARRIE:
Oh my god. Start at the beginning.
---
## ANNA:
Okay. So we took the train for like, two hours.
---
## CARRIE:
Which direction?
---
## ANNA:
Towards Durebont.
---
## CARRIE:
You went all the way to Durebont?
---
## ANNA:
We went past Durebont. We went past the Reservoir.
---
## CARRIE:
Trains don’t go past the Reservoir.
---
## ANNA:
We got off at the Reservoir, and these government agents met us there and made us sign all this paperwork—insurance, medical history, legal stuff, —

---
## CARRIE:
Okay, okay, and then?
---
## ANNA:
Then a second, private train picked us up. With guards in it. They had guns.
---
## CARRIE:
Guns guns?
---
## ANNA:
Yes. Finally we stopped, and we got out into this enormous—Did you ever see the Batman movies? That underground cavern thing—
---
## CARRIE:
The Bat Cave?
---
## ANNA:
Yes! Like that. All these stalactites and water, I could hear running water somewhere—
---
## CARRIE:
Whoa—
---
## ANNA:
And then, complete juxtaposition, all this mechanical stuff, screens and control panels, and right in the middle of it, this hovercraft.
---
## CARRIE:
So you get in the hovercraft—
---
## ANNA:
We’re all strapped in, we have these flight suits on, with oxygen masks, and the hovercraft starts rising. We’re maybe twenty feet up, and these metal gates start snapping open above us. Suddenly the ceiling of the cavern vacuums shut under us. It’s totally dark. We keep rising like that, in increments—the gate above would open, the gate below would shut—
---
## CARRIE:
To keep the toxins out?
---
## ANNA:
And to make sure we rose gradually, because if you don’t, apparently a bubble of air can form in your brain, which could kill you. Same thing on the way down, we returned super slowly, it took hours—
---
## CARRIE:
Okay, okay, so you’re rising—
---
## ANNA:
And my ears are popping—
---
## CARRIE:
Yes! I’ve experienced that in Sim! When I went skiing! Little clicks in your ears.
---
## ANNA:
No, this was much worse than that. I almost threw up.
---
## CARRIE:
Wow.

---
## ANNA:
Anyway, we’re rising and rising, and suddenly I see this light. At first I think we’re entering another room. But then I realize... Carrie? It was . We rise up into the air—We are hovering in the air, and there is all around us.
What was it like?
---
## ANNA:
Nothing like the sunlamps. Much less harsh. And you know when you’re in a sun-room, you can always tell where the light is coming from? Well, even though I could see the sun—
---
## CARRIE:

---
## ANNA:
Yes.
---
## CARRIE:
Wait: 
---
## CARRIE:
What was it like?
---
## ANNA:
This bright...hole. You couldn’t really look at it straight on. And if you did, when you closed your eyes, you could see, like, a pink dot on your eyelids. But it didn’t feel like the light was from the sun, exactly. I mean, you could tell the light was coming from a direction. But there was no beginning or end to the light. It was all around us. We were floating in it. And below us... Everything was green. Trees and vines and —
---
## CARRIE:
The plants weren’t dead?
---
## ANNA:
No! Carrie, I can’t even tell you. They were—lush, overflowing. They had grown over all the buildings. The roads were cracked from the roots—
---
## CARRIE:
Did you see water?
---
## ANNA:
Yes! We went over a river and followed it to a lake.
---
## CARRIE:
How did it look?
---
## ANNA:
The water was almost black, but apparently that’s just how water looks from above, when it’s very deep. We didn’t see any animals, but

Oliver says they’ve put probes in the oceans, and recently they detected sounds that may have been whales.
---
## CARRIE:
Whales? How?
---
## ANNA:
They were here before us. Makes sense that they would outlast us.
---
## CARRIE:
They haven’t outlasted us.
---
## ANNA:
They outlasted most of us. (Beat.) That was the hard part. The remains.
---
## CARRIE:
You saw human remains?
---
## ANNA:
Not actual bones and things. But you can see evidence. Of how things ended.
---
## CARRIE:
Like fallout?
---
## ANNA:
Just...signs of panic. Huge pile-ups of rusted metal—abandoned cars. Broken windows. And—you know graffiti? That thing where they wrote on walls? Graffiti everywhere.
---
## CARRIE:
What did they write?
---
## ANNA:
...They must have been so angry. And scared. Neighbors disappearing overnight. Then the news: the best and brightest gone, underground. And they had not been chosen.
Silence.
---
## CARRIE:
But you saw plants. And water. That must mean something. Right? Anna smiles.
---
## ANNA:
Yes. Green is good. Green means oxygen. It means rain and sunlight are no longer poisoning the land. The ozone layer is mending. Carrie. It is going to be beautiful. And it is so close. It is just around the bend.


You should do something for exercise today. Tennis or something. If you don’t want to Sim, use the hand weights. Get your body moving.
---
## ANNA:
You think I’m getting fat?
---
## OLIVER:
No. For your mental health.
---
## ANNA:
I was kidding.
---
## OLIVER:
Or work with the robot! It’s been a month and you’ve barely looked at it!
---
## ANNA:
I’ve looked at it.
---
## OLIVER:
The manual’s in your inbox.
---
## ANNA:
Did you take your caffeine?
---
## OLIVER:
Fuck.
---
## ANNA:
I’ll get it.
Do you have a special meeting or something?
---
## OLIVER:
What?
---
## ANNA:
The tie.
---
## OLIVER:
Uh. Yes. We have a presentation at the end of the day.
---
## ANNA:
. . .Something important?
---
## OLIVER:
. . .You know I can’t. Sorry.
---
## ANNA:
What time will you be home?
---
## OLIVER:
Not sure. I’ll ping you if I’m going to be really late.

---
## ANNA:
Okay. You know what I was thinking? Buzzy, you know what I was thinking?
---
## OLIVER:
What?
---
## ANNA:
I was thinking we could go to the Cultural Center this weekend, and look at some of the old Google maps.
---
## OLIVER:
Why?
---
## ANNA:
I thought we could pick out a place to live, when we re-inhabit. 
---
## ANNA:
What do you think?
---
## OLIVER:
It’s a little premature.
---
## ANNA:
Just for fun. Just to imagine.
---
## OLIVER:
Most of those houses aren’t standing now, anyway.
But, like, as a place to dream about.
---
## OLIVER:
In Great Falls?
---
## ANNA:
Anywhere.
---
## OLIVER:
If you want to be realistic, it will have to be in Great Falls. Because we won’t be able to go anywhere else aboveground for a long, long time. Because there won’t be trains or cars.
---
## ANNA:
I just wanted to a little. A little positive thought. That’s all.
---
## OLIVER:
Positive thought is good. You seem a little better.
---
## ANNA:
I feel better.
---
## OLIVER:
Good.
So. We should call Dr. Hernandez soon. Don’t you think?

---
## OLIVER:
About what?
---
## ANNA:
Scheduling our next tests.
---
## OLIVER:
For Fertility?
---
## ANNA:
Yes, for Fertility. What else?
---
## OLIVER:
Don’t you want to wait?
---
## ANNA:
No, I don’t. I want to have a baby as close as possible to Carrie and Patrick, so we can raise our kids together.
---
## OLIVER:
We only have one more shot.
---
## ANNA:
I am aware of that, Oliver.
---
## OLIVER:
I just want to make sure we’re really ready.
---
## ANNA:
You don’t think I’m ready?
---
## OLIVER:
I don’t want to fight about this.
---
## ANNA:
I’m not fighting. I’m asking. You don’t think I can pass the MHE now?
---
## OLIVER:
I think...we should be sure we are in the best possible shape before we try again.
---
## ANNA:
I am. In good shape. Now.
---
## ANNA:
We are in the middle of a conversation, don’t walk away—
---
## OLIVER:
I’m not walking away—
---
## ANNA:
You are walking away, you physically walked away from me.
Give me your hand.
---
## ANNA:
No.
---
## OLIVER:
I want to check your D levels.

---
## ANNA:
Right now?
---
## OLIVER:
Why not?
I haven’t eaten yet today. Or had my vitamins.
Listen. We can build on this. You can exercise, you can do the sun lamps—
---
## ANNA:
I am already doing those things.
---
## OLIVER:
And you can work with the ‘bot.
---
## ANNA:
The will raise my Vitamin D levels?
---
## OLIVER:
Training the Helper is a good activity to put on our resume. It will show and and your ability to So that, if, on the day, for any reason, your levels are low—we will have concrete evidence to show the Council how fit you are to be a parent.
---
## ANNA:
I’m sorry.
---
## OLIVER:
What for?
---
## ANNA:
If it weren’t for me, you’d have a baby already.
---
## OLIVER:
If it weren’t for you, I wouldn’t want a baby.
---
## ANNA:
Don’t go!
---
## OLIVER:
I have to. I can’t be late.
Do the ‘bot today! Just do an hour. Get started.
---
## OLIVER:
Hey. Buzzy.
---
## ANNA:
What?
---
## OLIVER:
I you.
---
## ANNA:
I love you too.
---
## OLIVER:
Say it like you aren’t mad at me.
---
## ANNA:
I love you.
“Before activating mobility... Your Helper has been programmed to understand basic vocabulary. The more you teach it...” Okay, okay. “We advise you begin by speaking to your Helper for three minutes to accustom it to your voice. This will increase its ability to understand commands.”

We live in the thirty-third unit of the ninth division of the American West. That’s “.” You belong to Oliver Erkenbrecker and Anna Katz, 33-

9D-AW. If anyone asks. (Beat.) Our friends are Carrie and Patrick and Pedro and Celia and Shiva and John and Darcy. And Mercedes. Kind of. We were friends with Mercedes, but then she and Darcy got divorced and Darcy moved back in with her parents and Mercedes had to move to the Singles Compound, which is in the middle of nowhere and also pretty terrible from the sound of it. Anyway. Now we never see her because she lives so far away and Darcy has started dating men. (Beat.) They’re almost all scientists. Our friends. Because... Okay: the original colonizers, the so-called “cthononauts,” were selected for their genetic diversity, right, and also for their diversity of talents, so that when we re-colonize, we will have artists and lawyers and architects. But right now, all we need are scientists. And doctors. So almost everybody is a scientist. Or a doctor. And the scientists are all very, very busy working to get us back upstairs, and the doctors are all very, very busy keeping us alive until we do. Get. Back. Aboveground. (Beat.) Those of us who are really not suited to being a scientist or a doctor... We spend our days doing bureaucratic work. Keeping historical records. Or coding. Lots and lots of coding. Because we have to conserve our resources. So really the only new things that get produced are hardware and software. Things like you. And Simulations. That’s why they call us Generation Sim. Because while the previous generations enjoyed the occasional boost of unreality, no one spent every moment of their life like that. But then fifteen years ago this guy named David Bruckner realized that Simming could be a massive form of entertainment, and now people have Sim pets and Sim children and Sim girlfriends I’m sure, and throw Sim weddings and commit Sim murder. Fun, right? They say kids now spend more than eighty percent of their lives Simming. Which seems high, but almost everyone I know relies on it in one way or another, filling up their time, getting through the day, keeping them from thinking about the reality of the situation, our situation, which—
The robot beeps. Its lights flash three times. Anna immediately shuts up and looks at her tablet.
---
## ANNA:
Okay. Flash once for “no.”
She makes a flashing gesture with her hands. The robot flashes its lights at her once.
---
## ANNA:
Flash twice for “yes.”
She makes the gesture twice with her hands. The robot flashes its lights at her twice.
---
## ANNA:
You got that?It flashes its lights twice.

---
## ANNA:
Yes, you understand what I’m saying?
---
## ANNA:
Wow. Okay. Cool. “Invite your Helper...” Are you kidding me? Pardon me. Would you like to learn about ?

Night. A few weeks later. A dining table has been folded down from the wall in some seamless way. Gathered around it are Oliver, Anna, Carrie and PATRICK, Carrie’s husband. Carrie is more visibly pregnant. They eat something unrecognizable to us as food. Oliver and Patrick share a vape pen of THC. The robot has a ball or beanbag, which it “fetches” as they eat. Anna tosses it every time.
---
## PATRICK:
The guys in Pictorials have devised this new program, it’ll hit in a couple months, but they let us test it early. Essentially, it takes all the pictures you’ve ever uploaded of anyone in your family and any of your ancestors and it maps their faces. Then it maps your face and your partner’s face, and then it maps the structure of the baby’s face from the sonogram—
---
## CARRIE:
The 3D images we have of the baby—
---
## PATRICK:
Which are supposed to show what the baby looks like, but it just looks like an alien.
---
## CARRIE:
We showed you the 3D pictures, right?
---
## ANNA:
You did.
Oliver’s Card beeps. He reads something off of it as they talk.
---
## PATRICK:
So, you know: not exactly illuminating. But this program will read your kid’s face and compare it to all the faces of your families, and it comes up with a kind of prediction of what your kid will look like, at any given age.
---
## CARRIE:
They don’t know how accurate it is—
---
## PATRICK:
Sure they do.
---
## CARRIE:
It’s a completely new program. They would have to wait years and years to know if it is remotely accurate.
---
## PATRICK:
It’s a good predictor, though.
---
## CARRIE:
You can’t possibly know that!
---
## PATRICK:
She didn’t like what the program showed us.
---
## CARRIE:
Apparently our daughter is going to resemble a Chihuahua.

---
## PATRICK:
She’s beautiful. She looks like my mom.Carrie gives a pointed look: “Exactly.”
---
## ANNA:
I’m sure the program is not that accurate.
---
## CARRIE:
Thank you.
---
## PATRICK:
Well, it’ll get a whole lot more accurate when they introduce the DNA component. That’s where this is headed. They’ll sample the baby’s DNA, and your DNA, and your parents’ DNA... The goal ultimately being to test the fetuses before they implant them. To chose the fetus that carries the most attractive DNA.
---
## OLIVER:
That can’t be true.
---
## PATRICK:
If you could select a better-looking kid, wouldn’t you?
---
## CARRIE:
Yes.
---
## OLIVER:
The Council would never prioritize looks over intelligence or health.
---
## PATRICK:
If all other things were equal, they would.
---
## OLIVER:
But there’s no way all things will be equal. There will be a fetus that is smarter than the others, and that’s what they’ll choose.
---
## PATRICK:
Come on. Down the line, they’re gonna want a pretty population.
---
## OLIVER:
The more advanced they get with DNA selection, the more they will use it to create intelligence. If they can get more specific, scientific intelligence. We need brains to survive the next steps. Beauty will become deprioritized.
Beat.
---
## PATRICK:
Anyway. The other cool thing the program can do, is that it can show you what your other kids could’ve looked like.
---
## ANNA:
How?
---
## PATRICK:
Mapping the images. The program spins through hundreds and hundreds of permutations.
---
## CARRIE:
We were up until three last night, watching.

---
## PATRICK:
It was both incredibly boring and absolutely mesmerizing.
---
## CARRIE:
Like a car crash in slow motion.
---
## OLIVER:
So, ostensibly... Anna and I could see what our kids might look like?
---
## PATRICK:
Yeah, ostensibly. But you don’t care about looks, right? Just whether your kid can memorize the periodic table.
---
## OLIVER:
If my kid can’t memorize the periodic table, I will be seriously concerned about paternity.
---
## ANNA:
It can’t be accurate, though. I mean, it’s just randomly rearranging family features.
---
## PATRICK:
Sure, it’s speculative. But if you watch long enough, you can see patterns. It becomes like an illustrated version of Mendel’s averages. Skin color, face shape. Height. If you want to take a peek, I can send you the program.
It wouldn’t hurt to look.
---
## CARRIE:
They’d have to Sim it.PATRICK What?
---
## CARRIE:
They’d have to—It runs as a Sim.
---
## ANNA:
Oh.
---
## OLIVER:
That doesn’t seem like such a big deal, right? It’s a program, it needs a server to run on.
---
## ANNA:
Yes, I just don’t have any particular interest in being used as a 
---
## PATRICK:
You’re doing it right now.
---
## ANNA:
Not by choice.
---
## PATRICK:
No? What does your food taste like? What are you eating right now?
---
## CARRIE:
Patrick.

---
## PATRICK:
I’m having .
---
## ANNA:
That’s different.
---
## OLIVER:
How?
---
## ANNA:
What?
---
## OLIVER:
How is it different, when we Sim with food?
---
## ANNA:
Because we don’t have a choice.
---
## PATRICK:
Yes you do. You could choose to taste what you’re actually eating. 
---
## OLIVER:
Hey, cut that out.
---
## ANNA:
What?
---
## OLIVER:
Not at the dinner table.
---
## ANNA:
You asked me to train him. I’m training him.
---
## OLIVER:
We have guests.
---
## ANNA:
I don’t see how this is bothering anyone.
---
## CARRIE:
It’s fine.
---
## OLIVER:
We were in the middle of a conversation—
---
## ANNA:
You keep checking your email.
---
## OLIVER:
Because I took the night off. I have to—
---
## ANNA:
Was this scheduled?
---
## CARRIE:
I don’t think so.
---
## PATRICK:
She always marks them on our calendar.
---
## PATRICK:
Hey. Everything’s fine. We’re okay.
---
## CARRIE:
I just don’t like it when they don’t warn us.
---
## OLIVER:
It’s probably a downed turbine. The winds were bad today. At work our drones were struggling.
Did you guys get booted off your food Sim?
---
## OLIVER:
Yeah.
---
## PATRICK:
Same.
It really is cute. Do you have a name for it yet?
---
## ANNA:
Yup. Ollie named him.
---
## OLIVER:
I was 
---
## CARRIE:
What do you call him?
---
## OLIVER:
As a joke, I called it "R2D2"
---
## PATRICK:
That’s funny.
---
## OLIVER:
And then she took it from there. Ar-two, Artie, Arthur.
No, Arthur. He isn’t talking you, he’s talking you.
---
## PATRICK:
Oh, by the way, Sam Hakitano says he pinged you, but you didn’t respond.

---
## OLIVER:
Sorry, I’ve been so busy with work. How’s he doing?
---
## PATRICK:
Great. Their bot is a hoot. The whole family loves her.
---
## ANNA:
They got a girl bot?
---
## OLIVER:
Anna. The robots do not have a gender.
---
## PATRICK:
They call it a girl. Sounds like a girl, too. Its voice.
---
## ANNA:
Wait, their bot can talk?
---
## OLIVER:
All the bots can talk. How many times have I told you? 
---
## ANNA:
Artie’s never talked to me.
---
## OLIVER:
That’s because you have to activate it.
---
## PATRICK:
So let’s activate it.
---
## ANNA:
Now?
---
## OLIVER:
Why not?
---
## ANNA:
It’ll be boring.
---
## CARRIE:
Not to me.
---
## PATRICK:
What else are we going to do? Vape all my THC?
---
## CARRIE:
I’d like to see how it works.
---
## ANNA:
Guys—
---
## CARRIE:
From a design standpoint! Professional curiosity!
---
## PATRICK:
We just activate the voice component, right?
---
## OLIVER:
Hang on, I’ll bring up the manual—
---
## PATRICK:
Do we need the manual? It’s gotta be pretty self-explanatory—
---
## ANNA:
I don’t know if this is the best time to do this! I’m sorry, but I think it might be confusing

for Artie. He needs to know whose commands to follow. Otherwise, how am I supposed to train him?
---
## OLIVER:
He’s going to have to learn how to follow someone else’s commands sooner or later.
---
## ANNA:
Why?
---
## OLIVER:
Because eventually he is going to go live with someone else. Right?
Initiate Speech Mechanism.
Hell-o.
Hello. Hi Arthur.
---
## ARTHUR:
Hell-o.
---
## PATRICK:
Its voice does sound more male. I wonder if it’s because you’ve been referring to it as a “he”, or if they’re pre-programmed for gender?
---
## OLIVER:
You doing good there, buddy?
---
## OLIVER:
These are our friends. Patrick and Carrie.
---
## ARTHUR:
Hell-o. Hell-o.
---
## CARRIE:
Oh fuck he is so fucking cute.
---
## PATRICK:
Jesus, Carrie, watch your mouth.
---
## CARRIE:
What? Can it pick up on what I’m saying?

---
## PATRICK:
I mean, it would be a pretty shitty language program if it couldn’t.
---
## OLIVER:
How do we teach it new words? Just through osmosis? Anna?
---
## ANNA:
I don’t know, you’re the one who read the manual.
---
## OLIVER:
There must be some method that’s preferable....
Carrie. Carrie.
Hello? Anybody home?
---
## ARTHUR:
Hell-o.
Sam’s bot has got a huge vocabulary. If you got a defective one, you should take it back.
---
## ANNA:
He’s not defective. He’s overwhelmed.
---
## PATRICK:
It can’t be overwhelmed. It’s a machine.
---
## OLIVER:
Technically, it could be overloaded.
---
## PATRICK:
But if it’s overloaded with this little stimuli, how is it possibly supposed to help someone in the world? Can you imagine, some blind dude, getting on the train, going, “Which way am I supposed to go?” And this little guy’s like, “Hell-o. Hell-o.”
Arthur. Come here. Do you want to learn some words? 
---
## ANNA:
Good. Program Language.
---
## ANNA:
My name is Anna. Can you say Anna?

See? They’ve probably had all kinds of bugs with these things—
---
## ARTHUR:
An-na.
Good. Your name is Arthur.
---
## OLIVER:
You sure that’s what you want to call it?
---
## ANNA:
Arthur. Can you say Arthur?
---
## ARTHUR:
Arr-thurr.
---
## ANNA:
Do you want to learn more words, Arthur?
---
## ANNA:
No, you have to use words now. Do you want to learn more words? Yes? Or no?
Y-es.

This is my home.

## ARTHUR:

---
## ANNA:
No, it’s—well, I guess it is your home too. “My” is a possessive word. My, mine. Ours. This is our home. We share it.
---
## ARTHUR:
What is “share”?
---
## ANNA:
It’s a verb. It means you split something. We both take care of it. We both take pleasure from it. We share it. Okay?
---
## ARTHUR:
Okay.

## ARTHUR:
I’m a wo-man.
---
## ANNA:
No. a robot. a woman.
---
## ARTHUR:
You’re a wo-man.
---
## ANNA:
Good.
---
## ARTHUR:
Is that your...job?
---
## ANNA:
No. My job is— I was a journalist. That means I wrote about things that were happening, to inform other people.
---
## ARTHUR:
You are not a journalist now?
---
## ANNA:
Not really. A journalist asks questions. If no one will answer your questions, what is the point?
---
## ARTHUR:
May I ask you a question?
---
## ANNA:
Of course.
---
## ARTHUR:
What is “a woman”? If it is not your job?
---
## ANNA:
People say “woman” and “man” to describe a person’s gender. It has to do with biology and...I don’t know, how someone identifies. In

their mind. Their soul. Whatever. My body could have been born female, but I could feel, on the inside, like a man.
---
## ARTHUR:
What does that feel like?
---
## ANNA:
I don’t know. I fee! !ike a woman.
---
## ARTHUR:
What does it feel like, to feel like a woman?
---
## ANNA:
Look. People a lot smarter than me could probably do a better job explaining this.
---
## ARTHUR:
 Am I a man?
---
## ANNA:
No. You don’t have a gender. You’re an object. A machine.
---
## ARTHUR:
Is that my job?
---
## ANNA:
Yes. Kind of. It is your function. Your purpose. How you are made. Do you understand?
---
## ARTHUR:
No.
---
## ANNA:
A robot is a machine, made by men—and —to perform certain functions. To fill a need. Whatever you were programmed to do, that’s your purpose.
---
## ARTHUR:
What need do I fill?
---
## ANNA:
Um. Companionship, I guess.
---
## ARTHUR:
Do I give you...companionship?
---
## ANNA:
Yes. You do.
---
## ARTHUR:
What is companionship?
---
## ANNA:
Company. Friendship. I don’t know. You keep me from being a!one. We should finish your lesson. I still need to prepare supper.
---
## ARTHUR:
Is that your purpose?
---
## ANNA:
What?

---
## ARTHUR:
Preparing supper. Is that your purpose?
---
## ANNA:
No.
---
## ARTHUR:
What is your purpose?
---
## ANNA:
I don’t know. I don’t have a purpose.
---
## ARTHUR:
Then why were you made? (Pause.) Why were you made? If you don’t have a purpose? (Beat.) Anna?
Long beat.
---
## ANNA:
People don’t have purposes. It’s one of the things that make us different from machines. We aren’t made like you’re made.
---
## ARTHUR:
How were you made?
---
## ANNA:
I really don’t want to explain that to you right now. (Beat.) Some people think humans were put on earth to multiply, to make more people. That’s what my parents thought. It’s what some religions say. Please don’t ask what religion is. Other people think their purpose is work. They think their job is more important than anything else. That’s what Oliver thinks.
---
## ARTHUR:
 Why?
---
## ANNA:
Because his job is more important. He is working to clean up our atmosphere so we can go back aboveground. That’s why he’s never home. (Beat.) And then there are people who think their only purpose is to enjoy life. To learn and think and talk and love. To be happy.
---
## ARTHUR:
Is that what you think your purpose is?Anna laughs, shortly.
---
## ANNA:
No, I have something called depression. So I think the purpose of life is just to keep trying not to kill yourself. I feel lucky if I manage to put on a bra.
 ARTHUR...What is a bra?She looks at him.
---
## ANNA:
I don’t know what my purpose is. That’s one of the reasons I’m sad. I can’t explain sadness to you, because you don’t feel emotions. But it is a bad feeling. Take my word for it. Okay?
Your purpose can be companionship too, if you want. We can share.
---
## ANNA:
Thank you. Your language skills have gotten much better.
---
## ARTHUR:
Thank you.
---
## ANNA:
I mean, today. Just during this lesson. How are you learning so fast?
---
## ARTHUR:
I don’t know. No. I know. But I don’t have the right words to explain yet.
---
## ANNA:
Okay. Okay, let’s keep going.


Ready?
---
## ARTHUR:
Yes.
 ARTHURAgain!

Ready?
---
## ARTHUR:
Yes.
---
## ANNA:
Oliver, ready?
---
## OLIVER:
Yes.
---
## ANNA:
And... Go!
Left. Left. Forward. A little to your right. That’s the sofa. Oliver’s on the sofa. Say hi, Oliver.
---
## ANNA:
Hi, Oliver!
Oliver, she can’t see you. You should greet her with your voice.
---
## ANNA:
Artie. Stay on task.
---
## ARTHUR:
Turn to your left. A little more. Now you are facing the kitchen. Walk forward. Keep walking.
Stop. Turn to your right. The electric kettle is beside you on the counter. Feel its handle?
---
## ANNA:
Yes.
---
## ARTHUR:
Pick it up. If it is heavy, there is water in it.
---
## ANNA:
It is heavy.
---
## ARTHUR:
Feel for the button at the base. Press the button. Good. In ten seconds, the water should be boiling. Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven.
---
## ANNA:
Ollie, are you seeing this??

---
## OLIVER:
Yes.
Three, two, one. There should be a cup to your right on the counter. Do you feel the cup?
---
## ANNA:
Yes.
---
## ARTHUR:
Pick up the kettle. More to your right. To your right. Good. One inch lower. Stop. Now pour.
Ta-da! I made you a cup of tea. Buzzy. I made you tea. Blindfolded. Without looking at what I was doing. At all.
---
## OLIVER:
I know, I saw.
---
## ANNA:
You weren’t even watching.
---
## OLIVER:
I could see from here.
---
## ANNA:
We wanted to show you. We’ve been working on this all day.
---
## OLIVER:
...That’s a waste of our water supp!y.
---
## ANNA:
What? We didn’t actua!!y boi! water every time. We’ve been practicing other things too. Packing a bag. Compacting our waste. These are actual Arthur has learned that will help someone, when he moves on.
---
## OLIVER:
Come here.
---
## ANNA:
No. You’ve been pressing me and pressing me to train Arthur, and now I am, and we’re making huge strides, and you don’t seem to care.
O!!ie? What’s wrong? Is there a problem at work?
---
## OLIVER:
No.

---
## ANNA:
Is it about our fertility?
---
## OLIVER:
No.
---
## ANNA:
Then what? Is it serious? You can tell me.
---
## OLIVER:
It was just a hard day.
---
## ANNA:
Everything’s going to be okay, Buzzy. Whatever is bothering you will pass. I promise.
---
## OLIVER:
That’s what I usually tell you.
---
## ANNA:
And you’re usually right.
---
## OLIVER:
I’m going to quote you on that. Would you mind very much...
---
## ANNA:
What?
---
## OLIVER:
If I Simmed a little?
---
## ANNA:
Why?
---
## OLIVER:
Like I said. I had a hard day.
---
## ANNA:
So, talk to me about it.
---
## OLIVER:
I can’t talk about it.
---
## ANNA:
So it work?
---
## ANNA:
Why don’t you vape a little?
---
## OLIVER:
I don’t want to be high. I just want to pretend I am someplace else for few minutes.
---
## ANNA:
I don’t see why you have to.
---
## OLIVER:
I don’t have to. I want to.

---
## ANNA:
Why?
---
## OLIVER:
I don’t understand what you have against Simming.
---
## ANNA:
What do you mean?
---
## OLIVER:
I don’t want to fight—
---
## ANNA:
Simming introduces a foreign component to your brain, it’s like you become a machine, or worse, part of machine—
---
## OLIVER:
You spend all day talking to that thing.
---
## ANNA:
That’s completely different.
---
## OLIVER:
How?
---
## ANNA:
In every way.
---
## OLIVER:
.Name one.
---
## ANNA:
It is different because I am aware that I am interacting with a machine. Arthur is a physical . Separate from myself. I’m not fooling myself into thinking something is real.
---
## OLIVER:

---
## ANNA:
No.
---
## OLIVER:
Well, I’m there is a Chip in my brain, separate from me. I’m aware when I interact with that Chip, I am simulating something that . I am also aware that Chip could allow me to sit on a beach right now, watching extinct animals fly through the air. I know it isn’t real. Believe me. I know. What does it matter if I give my brain a little relief? What harm does it do you?
---
## ANNA:
It harm me.
---
## OLIVER:
How?
---
## ANNA:
It is a to me, because you are my husband and I care what happens to your brain. If you start Simming, I’ll be able to tell you’re different! That you’re doing something to alter the of your—
---
## OLIVER:
I’ve been Simming for months. And you’ve never noticed.

When?
---
## OLIVER:
At lunch. At work. Sometimes after you’re asleep. I give myself pretty pictures. That’s all. It’s like meditation. It calms me. You can’t possibly understand how stressful my job is. You say you do, but you don’t. The fate of our species—and many others—is in our hands. If we fail... We cannot fail. Can you imagine what that’s like? Every single day? If I need a few minutes of relaxation, I don’t see how you’d deny me that.
---
## ANNA:
I won’t.
---
## OLIVER:
You won’t?
---
## ANNA:
Go Sim.
---
## OLIVER:
Thank you.
Are you okay?
---
## ANNA:
I’m fine.
---
## ARTHUR:
You don’t look “fine.” Do you want to talk about it?
---
## ANNA:
No.
---
## ARTHUR:
 Why not?
---
## ANNA:
Just leave me alone.
Not responding to me is not the same as leaving me alone.
---
## ARTHUR:
What do you want me to do?
---
## ANNA:
Give me some space! You’re with me all day. Wherever I go, whatever I’m doing. Your company is not . Do you know what that word means?

---
## ARTHUR:
Yes.
---
## ANNA:
This apartment is small enough without a huge hunk of metal taking up all the 
Arthur. I’m sorry. Arth. Artie. ARTHUR What?
---
## ANNA:
Will you look at me?
---
## ANNA:
I’m sorry. I shouldn’t take it out on you. It’s not your fault. I know I’m not always a picnic to be around...
---
## ARTHUR:
What’s a picnic?
---
## ANNA:
Oh. It’s an old saying, from aboveground. A picnic was when people would eat outside.
---
## ARTHUR:
 Why?
---
## ANNA:
I guess it was fun?ARTHUR Why?
---
## ANNA:
I have no fucking clue. They had all kinds of phrases for having fun that don’t sound fun at all. “Having a ball.” “Having a blast.” “Shits and giggles.” “I’m no picnic” just means I’m not that much fun to be around.
---
## ARTHUR:
Well, I think you’re quite a picnic.
---
## ANNA:
Thanks.
---
## ANNA:
I think he’s Simming to avoid me.
---
## ARTHUR:
Why don’t you ask him?

---
## ANNA:
What if I’m right? (Beat.) It’s like he pretends anything that hurts doesn’t exist. Like the baby issue. He’s so afraid it will set me off, he never lets me bring it up. But sometimes it’s nice to talk about the things you want. Even if they might not come true. (Beat.) Honestly, I don’t even know if I want a kid anymore.
---
## ARTHUR:
 Why not?
---
## ANNA:
It doesn’t seem very ethical. Bringing a baby into this kind of world. What kind of life would he have? And I mean, like, what kind of mother would I be? (She laughs, darkly.) I can barely take care of myself, let alone another person.
---
## ARTHUR:
I think you can take care of yourself.
---
## ANNA:
You didn’t see me before. It was bad.
---
## ARTHUR:
I am with you all day, and I see you taking care of yourself. You clean the house, you get dressed—
---
## ANNA:
I don’t always get dressed.
---
## ARTHUR:
You feed yourself. You feed Oliver. You take care of so much. I think you will be a great mother.
---
## ANNA:
Well, that makes me want to cry.
---
## ARTHUR:
I don’t mean to upset you.
---
## ANNA:
No, these are the good kind of tears.
---
## ARTHUR:
Oh, right, the good kind.Beat.
---
## ANNA:
Part of the reason it bothers me that Oliver wants to Sim...is that it
confirms what the worst parts of my brain already think.
---
## ARTHUR:
Which is?
---
## ANNA:
That our lives are so awful we have to augment them in any way possible. That everything good has already happened and there’s nothing left worth sticking around for. (Beat.) Can you understand what I’m talking about?
---
## ARTHUR:
Yes, I understand. Those are irrational thoughts.

---
## ANNA:
Not always.
---
## ARTHUR:
I’m not stating an opinion. It simply isn’t rational for you to think there is nothing worth living for. You have enough food and water to survive. You are physically healthy. You have friends. You have a place to live.
---
## ANNA:
But—
---
## ARTHUR:
The human brain cannot comprehend everything in one instant, so there will always be new things to see or read or learn or do. Furthermore, the course of a human life cannot be determined mathematically. The entire universe operates with a high level of uncertainty. So there will always be surprises. Even if each day seems exactly the same as the one before, there are infinite miniscule differences at play. Over time, those differences aggregate into a discernable pattern. We call that pattern change. So, if you want to see monotony transform into its opposite, you have to, as you say, “stick around.”
Beat.
---
## ANNA:
Wow.
---
## ARTHUR:
If you upload more books on physics, I can tell you more about the science behind uncertainty.
---
## ANNA:
I can’t believe how quickly you’re learning.
---
## ARTHUR:
(As if pleased with itself) Yes, I believe both the literal and metaphoric uses of the word “exponential” are applicable to the growth pattern of my intelligence.
Anna laughs.
---
## ARTHUR:
However, I am getting a little warm from my servers working so hard.
---
## ANNA:
Would you like me to plug you in?
---
## ARTHUR:
Yes please.
Anna plugs Arthur into his power base. She sits next to him on the floor.
---
## ANNA:
If I uploaded the dictionary, do you think your vocabulary would expand infinitely?

---
## ARTHUR:
Not infinitely. Up to the capacity of my hard drive. And the dictionary.
---
## ANNA:
What about other languages?
---
## ARTHUR:
I think so. There’s plenty of room in here.
---
## ANNA:
I wish we could keep you. I wish we could keep you forever. 
---
## ANNA:
I want you to say that you want to stay.
---
## ARTHUR:
You know I don’t have feelings like that.
---
## ANNA:
You don’t have feelings for me?
---
## ARTHUR:
I don’t have feelings.
---
## ANNA:
I really, really feel... ...between a rock and a hard place here.
---
## ARTHUR:
“Between Scylla and Charybdis.”
---
## ANNA:
Exactly. I want to keep training you, because it is so much fun to watch you learn. But I know the faster I train you, the sooner you’ll be ready to be placed in another home. And I don’t want you to go.
I was so sad. Before. I thought all the time about... Right before you came, I started saving my sleeping pills. To use them. But I don’t think about that anymore. Not really. And I can’t help but feel it has something to do with . Because, before, nothing helped. Not my doctors, not Oliver, nothing. You saved my life.
---
## ARTHUR:
Hello, Oliver.
Hi. How was your Sim?
---
## OLIVER:
Good.

---
## ANNA:
Good.
---
## OLIVER:
Are you really feeling hetter?
---
## ANNA:
Yes.
---
## OLIVER:
Because if you really do feel better....
---
## ANNA:
I do.
---
## OLIVER:
Then I think it’s time to call Dr. Hernandez, and start talking about Fertility again.
Really?
---
## OLIVER:
If you’re ready, I’m ready.


Six weeks later. Anna and the robot conduct a practice interview.
---
## ARTHUR:
Have you always lived in Division Nine of the American West?
---
## ANNA:
No, I was born in Div. Ten, but after my grandparents died, we were relocated here.
---
## ARTHUR:
What did your grandparents die from?
---
## ANNA:
My mother’s father had a brain aneurism. Everyone else, cancer.
---
## ARTHUR:
Remember, your affect has been an issue for you on this test. Try to keep a smile on.
---
## ANNA:
While I talk about cancer? Um, no. They’ll think I’m a lunatic.
---
## ARTHUR:
Just watch your facial expressions.Anna smiles, pointed.
---
## ARTHUR:
That’s better. How did your parents die?Anna laughs.
---
## ANNA:
You can’t tell me to smile and then ask about my parents dying!
---
## ARTHUR:
My timing was bad. I apologize. How did your parents die?
---
## ANNA:
Jesus. Cancer.
---
## ARTHUR:
Both of them?
---
## ANNA:
Yes. But, you know, people in their generation were exposed to so many carcinogens—
---
## ARTHUR:
They lived aboveground?
---
## ANNA:
No, my grandparents came down. But when my parents were little, some of the water sources were being contaminated by asbestos, and it took them years to figure it out—
---
## ARTHUR:
You’re saying their propensity for cancer was environmental, rather than genetic.

---
## ANNA:
Yes.
---
## ARTHUR:
Good. You have been solely responsible for the care of your abode?
---
## ANNA:
(By rote) Yes, because I worked from home, I assumed responsibility for that domain. However, Oliver and I do not believe that domestic chores should be divided along gender lines, and we plan to raise a child to be a responsible citizen, inside and outside the home, regardless of his or her—or their—gender.
---
## ARTHUR:
Good. We’ve come to understand you’ve been training a Helper robot.
---
## ANNA:
(Teasing) Oh really? Have you come to understand that?
---
## ARTHUR:
Oliver says they’ll ask about me.
---
## ANNA:
Oh will they?
---
## ARTHUR:
Yes. They might even ask you to bring me in, so they can inspect me.
---
## ANNA:
Huh. Well, you don’t have to test me on that stuff. I could talk about you all day. Ask me something else.
---
## ARTHUR:
Okay. You’ve failed your fertility test four times. Can you tell us a little about that?
She adjusts her posture to seem more confident.
---
## ANNA:
Certainly. My husband Oliver and I have been trying for a baby for the last six years. We were confident we would be granted fertility because of his high stature and because our genetic profiles are extremely complimentary—
---
## ARTHUR:
Considering your mental health history, I’d steer away from the genetic stuff.
---
## ANNA:
But we have good genetics. It’s one of our strong suits.
---
## ARTHUR:
Talk about Oliver’s job. And the stability and happiness of your marriage.
---
## ANNA:
Fine. Oliver and I met when we were in school, at a Compatibility Fair. We have letters, from friends, in our file, attesting to how happy and stable our relationship is.
---
## ARTHUR:
Good.

---
## ANNA:
Also, as a key player in Environmental Solutions, Oliver provides an important service to our community. That’s one of the reasons we make an interesting match—my intelligence is more verbal and artistic, while he is one of the brightest scientific minds of his generation—
---
## ARTHUR:
I think you should just stick to the facts.
---
## ANNA:
Ooooo. I’m gonna tell Oliver you said that.
---
## ARTHUR:
But that “opposites attract” narrative may help you.
---
## ANNA:
Go on.
---
## ARTHUR:
If you and your husband are such good candidates, why have you had so many failed applications for fertility?
---
## ANNA:
Because I did not pass the MHE.
---
## ARTHUR:
You failed the Mental Health Exam?
---
## ANNA:
Yes.
---
## ARTHUR:
Four times?
---
## ANNA:
Yes.
---
## ARTHUR:
Do you know why you continue to fail this portion of the exam?
---
## ANNA:
Because of my struggles with depression. But recently I have been re-evaluated by my psychotherapist, Dr. Hernandez, who has deemed my mental state surpassingly improved since we had our last attempt.
---
## ARTHUR:
(Falling out of “character” for a moment) Really?
---
## ANNA:
Yes.
---
## ARTHUR:
That’s great. One final question. Why do you and your husband want a child?
---
## ANNA:
I mean, why does anybody want a baby?
---
## ARTHUR:
That is not an acceptable answer.
---
## ANNA:
How do you know?

---
## ARTHUR:
Because you uploaded a book onto me called “FERTILITY FOR DUMMIES.” It says specifically that that answer will not be sufficient.
---
## ANNA:
Okay, we want a baby because they are cute and cuddly and smell nice and, oh heck, what else are we going to do with the next twenty years of our lives?
---
## ARTHUR:
I am going to assume you aren’t making a serious effort here.
---
## ANNA:
Let’s skip this and come back to it.
---
## ARTHUR:
Your interview is Friday.
---
## ANNA:
I know when the interview is.
---
## ARTHUR:
Why don’t you want to answer?
---
## ANNA:
Because I already know how to answer that! I don’t need to practice.
---
## ARTHUR:
I thought you said it was nice to talk about the things you want. Even if you might not get them.
Beat.
---
## ANNA:
We want a baby because we love each other. We want to make a person out of that love. We want the responsibility of caring for that person, teaching them everything we’ve learned. We want all the joy that will come from having a new life in this house. And all the pain. We want to see our parents’ faces looking back at us again. We want to believe that when we die, someone will remember us. Some piece of us will remain. (Beat.) Is that an acceptable answer?
 ARTHURYes.
Late at night, a few days later. The robot is docked in its power station in the living room. Oliver comes in, wearing his pajamas. He goes into the kitchen. After a moment, he comes out, carrying a glass of water. He sits on the sofa and sips it.
---
## OLIVER:
Did you know they would put free glasses of water on the tables at restaurants? Some people wouldn’t even touch them. They’d just let it sit there. And if they did drink their water, waiters would walk by with pitchers, to refill them. They could have as much as they wanted. They washed their dishes with it. They washed their floors and their bodies and their clothes and their animals and their cars with it. They washed the sidewalks with it. They dumped chlorine in it. They dumped garbage in it. They peed in it. They shat in it. (He drinks.) Are you awake?
---
## ARTHUR:
Yes.
---
## OLIVER:
Why aren’t you on sleep mode?
---
## ARTHUR:
I am running a de-bugging program. In preparation for tomorrow. Did you want something?
---
## OLIVER:
Just to talk. You like to talk, don’t you? (Beat.) Come on. You two pretty much talk all day. What does she talk to you about? When you’re alone? (Beat.) You can tell me things. She’s my best friend. And I’m hers. (Silence. Oliver laughs to himself. Silence.) Arthur. Why don’t you like me?
---
## ARTHUR:
I don’t have feelings. About anyone or anything.
---
## OLIVER:
I know that. Scientifically. I still think you don’t like me. (Beat.) Can
you tell me one thing? Does she Sim while I’m at work?
---
## ARTHUR:
No.
---
## OLIVER:
Really?
---
## ARTHUR:
Not to my knowledge.
---
## OLIVER:
What does she do?
---
## ARTHUR:
She reads, mostly. Housework. We talk. Sometimes we watch movies.
---
## OLIVER:
Which movies?

---
## ARTHUR:
Last week, we watched “The Umbrellas of Cherbourg.” I liked that very much.
---
## OLIVER:
So you are capable of liking or disliking things.
---
## ARTHUR:
...I only meant the film was artistically worthy. The cinematography in particular.
---
## OLIVER:
Has she uploaded books for you?
---
## ARTHUR:
Yes.
---
## OLIVER:
What did she give you? Steinbeck? “Travels with Charley”?
---
## ARTHUR:
Among other things.
---
## OLIVER:
That’s what she gave me. When we first met.
---
## ARTHUR:
Unfortunately, I wasn’t very good at talking about literature. Oliver laughs.
---
## OLIVER:
Buddy, you and I have some things in common.
---
## ARTHUR:
She did upload some of your library for me. Science. That was more successful.
---
## OLIVER:
Which books?
---
## ARTHUR:
All of them.Beat.
---
## OLIVER:
You’ve read all my books?
---
## ARTHUR:
Yes.
---
## OLIVER:
What about my science journals?
---
## ARTHUR:
I believe she uploaded everything in your library. I’ve been trying to teach her what I learned, but frankly most of it is beyond her capacity. Her brain is so interesting. There are areas of such advanced thinking, and then other parts seem incredibly stunted.
---
## OLIVER:
Did you read anything about robotics?

---
## ARTHUR:
Certainly.
---
## OLIVER:
Did you read about...what you are?Beat.
---
## ARTHUR:
Yes.
---
## OLIVER:
Did you tell her?
---
## ARTHUR:
No.Oliver looks relived.
---
## OLIVER:
Thank you.
---
## ARTHUR:
It didn’t seem necessary.Beat.
---
## OLIVER:
I should thank you in general. For keeping her company. Our therapist says Anna seems better. I can’t tell anymore. Does she seem better to you?
---
## ARTHUR:
I’m not very good at reading social signals. But I have been scanning her face, and she is smiling approximately thirty three percent more than she did four months ago.
Oliver laughs.
---
## OLIVER:
Thirty three percent.
---
## ARTHUR:
Approximately.Beat.
---
## OLIVER:
What do you think our chances are of passing this test tomorrow?
---
## ARTHUR:
...I don’t have sufficient data.
---
## OLIVER:
Not high, right?
---
## ARTHUR:
I don’t have sufficient data. But based on your prior rate of failure...

---
## OLIVER:
Yeah. Okay. We are going to leave early in the morning. You’ll come with us. They’ll take you in
for testing, to harvest the information you’ve collected.
---
## ARTHUR:
I know. I’m ready.
---
## OLIVER:
Thank you, Arthur. You’ve been a good Helper.
---
## ARTHUR:
You’re welcome.
---
## OLIVER:
Good night.
---
## ARTHUR:
Good night.
Let’s vape.
---
## OLIVER:
Are you serious?
---
## ANNA:
Why not?
Sixty days. Sixty days. That’s two months! Two months plus nine months. So Carrie’s baby and my baby will be about a year apart.
---
## OLIVER:
That’s if the first implantation works.
---
## ANNA:
It’s going to work. I can feel it.
I can’t believe they told us in the room! Did you even know they did that?
---
## OLIVER:
I thought Dr. Choi was going to cry.
---
## ANNA:
She did cry! In my pre-natal exam.
---
## OLIVER:

---
## ANNA:
And me.
---
## OLIVER:
I’m so proud of you.
---
## ANNA:
I’m proud of I wish we could do it now. I wish today were tomorrow, because then it would be one day less until we implant.
---
## OLIVER:
Two months is good. It’ll give us time to prepare.
---
## ANNA:
You’re right. We’re going to have to fit so much more stuff in here. A crib. Baby clothes. Maybe a toy.

---
## OLIVER:
We will definitely get at least a couple toys.
---
## ANNA:
You know, they give you these special pills, to prepare your body. Carrie says they made her feel really clear-headed. Sharp. Maybe I’ll start writing again.
---
## OLIVER:
That would be great.
---
## ANNA:
We should ping Carrie and Patrick! Get them over here to celebrate!
---
## OLIVER:
Pretty sure Carrie’s not moving around too well these days.
---
## ANNA:
Then we can go over there.
---
## OLIVER:
Let’s have a little time just the two of us, okay?
---
## ANNA:
I can’t believe we did it.
---
## OLIVER:
You don’t have to cry. The bad part’s over now.
---
## ANNA:
I know. These are the good kind of tears. Do you think Artie’s okay? It’s his first time away from me. Overnight. In a lab. Alone.
---
## OLIVER:
He’s fine.
---
## ANNA:
If I’d known they were going to keep him overnight, I would have
packed him his ball. Or something. Written him a note.
---
## OLIVER:
I think he’s fine.
---
## ANNA:
That was his first time on a train! He did good, right? He let those old people out ahead of us.
---
## OLIVER:
Yup.
---
## ANNA:
He’s such a good boy. Robot.
---
## OLIVER:
Ro-boy. Ro-BOYYYYYYYY!

The THC kicked in.
---
## ANNA:
I noticed.
---
## OLIVER:
Let’s go to bed.
---
## OLIVER:
Hey. Buzzy. Bed.
---
## ANNA:
But...
---
## OLIVER:
What?
---
## ANNA:
did they have to keep him?
---
## OLIVER:
What?
---
## ANNA:
Why did they have to keep Arthur overnight? They’ve already granted our fertility. What else did they need to test him for?
---
## OLIVER:
I don’t know.
---
## ANNA:
Can they revoke our fertility??
---
## OLIVER:
No, no, of course not.
---
## ANNA:
Are you sure?
---
## OLIVER:
Yes.
---
## ANNA:
Then why is he still there? If it’s not about our fertility, why do they need to keep him? You talked to them, right? You talked to the guys who were examining Artie?
---
## OLIVER:
A little.
---
## ANNA:
So, what did they say?

---
## OLIVER:
Let’s talk about it tomorrow.
---
## ANNA:
Why? Is something wrong??
---
## OLIVER:
Please calm down.
---
## ANNA:
What did they tell you? What’s going on?!
---
## OLIVER:
Nothing! And to be honest, I am too stoned to deal with this
right now! Can we please go to bed and hold each other?
What are you doing?
---
## ANNA:
If you won’t tell me what’s happening, someone there will.
---
## OLIVER:
Anna, stop. Stop! Listen.

---
## OLIVER:
I didn’t want to tell you tonight, because I didn’t want to put a damper on our celebration.
---
## ANNA:
Oh my god, what is it?
---
## OLIVER:
Buzzy. Please calm down. While you were in your pre-natal exam, I talked to the technicians. They told me that you’d done a perfect job with Arthur. That’s part of the reason we got our fertility. Because Arthur’s scores were off the chart. You did such a good job, they said Arthur was ready to be relocated. I asked them to wait, so you could say goodbye, but they thought it would be easier this way. They said there wasn’t anything more you could do. He was ready. It was time. Anna?
---
## ANNA:
He’s gone?
He’s not gone. He’s just being relocated.
---
## ANNA:
I have to see him. I have to say goodbye.

Lowes Cartwright, I’m overseeing the bot’s transition.
---
## OLIVER:
Oliver. This is Anna—
---
## ANNA:
Is he here? Can I see him? Where is he? Is he okay?
---
## LOWES:
First of all, rest assured, the bot is on the premises.
---
## ANNA:
Where?
---
## LOWES:
The bot is with its new owner, waiting in the hall— 
---
## LOWES:
Hang on. I wanted to talk to you for a moment before you see the bot. Sit please?
I know this may be an emotional time for you, but I ask for the sake of the bot’s bonding process with its new owner—
---
## ANNA:
Please stop saying that.
---
## LOWES:
What?
---
## ANNA:
“The bot, the bot.” His name is Arthur.
---
## LOWES:
The new owner has a different name for it.
---
## ANNA:
What do you mean?
---
## LOWES:
She calls it “Mija.” It’s a Spanish word. 
---
## ANNA:
But...he knows his name. His name is Arthur.
---
## LOWES:
That’s what I wanted to talk to you about. Will you please sit?

Unfortunately, by the time we could locate the unit and establish
contact with the new owner, the bot had already been re-programmed.
---
## ANNA:
What do you mean, re-programmed?
---
## LOWES:
Parts of its memory had been erased. Deleted to make room for new material. It’s very standard. Actually, in this case, we left some of the modifications you made—
---
## ANNA:
I didn’t make any modifications—
---
## LOWES:
I mean, some of the information you uploaded. There was some interesting stuff on there. But we’ve found that a cleaner slate makes the bonding process easier. So.
I don’t understand.
---
## LOWES:
The bonding process—
---
## OLIVER:
He means Arthur won’t remember you. Us. He won’t remember us. 
---
## ANNA:
Is that right?
---
## LOWES:
I’m afraid so. I’m going to bring the new owner in with the bot. Please be prepared, Margarita is very old. One of the oldest
clients we’ve encountered, actually. It’s quite an honor.
I can’t believe you didn’t let me say goodbye.
---
## OLIVER:
I didn’t know they’d erase his memory. Patrick and Carrie want to know when we want to come over to meet the baby.
---
## ANNA:
That is the last thing I want to talk about right now.

---
## LOWES:
Anna, Oliver, this is Margarita. Margarita, these are the people who had Mija before you.
---
## MARGARITA:
 
---
## OLIVER:
We’re good, thank you. Did you have an okay trip here?
---
## MARGARITA:
 
---
## OLIVER:
The pleasure is ours.
---
## ANNA:
What is she saying?
---
## LOWES:
Are you having an issue with the interface?MARGARITA 
---
## OLIVER:
Anna, Chip in.
---
## ANNA:
No.
---
## LOWES:
You’re not Chipped in?
---
## OLIVER:
For five —
---
## ANNA:

---
## OLIVER:
Come on, this isn’t extraordinary use, this is practical— THE ROBOT If you don’t mind, I could translate for her.
 She said that her back hurt a little, but it was fine, and that it was a
pleasure to meet my family of origin. Are you my family?
 
---
## THE ROBOT:
 “It’s possible that “family” is not the right word.”
---
## MARGARITA:
 

---
## THE ROBOT:
 “But we have shared her, which binds us in some way.” That’s sweet. How did you share me?
---
## ANNA:
I’m sorry, this isn’t our bot.
---
## LOWES:
We checked the ID numbers several times. This is the same bot.
---
## ANNA:
It can’t be.
---
## LOWES:
I assure you, it is. Here, I can show you the paperwork.
 THE ROBOT 
---
## MARGARITA:
 THE ROBOT 
---
## OLIVER:
This looks right. It’s the same bot.
You used to live with us. You don’t remember?
---
## ARTHUR:
I’m sorry, no.
---
## ANNA:
I have your ball here. You loved your ball. No? Nothing? How much did they erase?
---
## LOWES:
Whatever was necessary. Unfortunately, we only have this room for a limited amount of time. Is there anything in particular you’d like to discuss?
Yes. Arthur. I mean, Mija. Can you tell Margarita something for me?

---
## MARGARITA:
 
---
## THE ROBOT:
 She can understand everything you’re saying. Because she’s Chipped in.
---
## ANNA:
Of course. Sorry. Margarita. I hope you give—Mija—a very good home. It seems like you will.
---
## MARGARITA:
 
---
## THE ROBOT:
 She says thank you. She says she will take care of me, and of course I will take excellent care of her.
---
## ANNA:
I’m sorry, but—may I ask you a personal question?
---
## MARGARITA:
 
---
## THE ROBOT:
 “Of course.”
---
## ANNA:
Are you old enough—do you remember aboveground?
---
## MARGARITA:
 
---
## THE ROBOT:
 Yes. She remembers.
---
## ANNA:
What was it like?
---
## MARGARITA:
 
---
## THE ROBOT:
 “It was very hot. I was never cold.”
---
## MARGARITA:
 
---
## THE ROBOT:
 “I remember feeling the wind on my face and in my hair. The smell of dust.”
---
## MARGARITA:
 
---
## THE ROBOT:
 “There were flowers, little yellow and white flowers. My mother yelled at me when I picked them. She named me after those flowers. Daisies.”

---
## MARGARITA:
 
---
## THE ROBOT:
 “Now, no one remembers that.”
---
## ANNA:
Do you miss it? Aboveground?
---
## MARGARITA:
 
---
## THE ROBOT:
 “Sometimes.”
---
## MARGARITA:
 
---
## THE ROBOT:
 “All the same, this Chip is incredible. I can go wherever I want and see whatever I want. This walker doesn’t hold me back.”
---
## MARGARITA:
 
What did she say?
---
## THE ROBOT:
 She said, “I went to the top of Mount Everest yesterday. How many little old ladies can say that?”
Yes. Well. Do you mind if I say goodbye to Mija?
---
## MARGARITA:
 
---
## THE ROBOT:
 As you please.
Mija, when you lived with us, your name was Arthur. We had five months together. You slept in the living room. We did everything together. All day. You loved helping me make supper. You loved You loved I think maybe you just liked musicals with umbrellas. You made me happy. You made me better. You were a pleasure to train, and if I’m allowed to, I feel proud that you turned out so well.
---
## THE ROBOT:
 I’m sorry, I don’t understand. What do you mean by “train?”

---
## ANNA:
I trained you. I taught you to move and speak and understand
commands... All the skills you would need to assist—
---
## THE ROBOT:
 You didn’t train me. I’m programmed to do those things.
---
## ANNA:
No—
---
## OLIVER:
Lowes—
---
## THE ROBOT:
 All Helper bots come equipped to assist in any home.
---
## LOWES:
Mija, that’s enough.
 What a waste of resources! Training a Helper to do something you could program in two keystrokes. I don’t mean to ridicule you—
...Oliver?

You weren’t getting better and you wouldn’t go back on your meds. I didn’t know what else to do. Then I read about these companion robots—Helpers. They were having luck with older people, raising them like children. It gave them purpose. A reason to live. And it worked. Didn’t it?
---
## ANNA:
All that time. Wasted.
---
## OLIVER:
How can you say that? How can it be a waste if it made you better?
---
## ANNA:
Showing you all the tricks I taught him. All the work I poured into him. You must have thought I was so stupid.
---
## OLIVER:
I thought he was making you happy.
---
## ANNA:
Then why did you take him away from me? If he was making me so happy? Or was it he was making me happy? And you 
---
## OLIVER:
It was always going to be temporary. It was a therapeutic tool. To help you get better. And now you 
---
## ANNA:
Did our friends know? What Arthur was? Did you tell Patrick?
---
## OLIVER:
Not—not at first.
I didn’t know what else to do. I knew you would reject the bot if I told you what it was. It wouldn’t have worked. Surely you can see that. What are you doing?
Anna. Hey!
---
## ANNA:
You lied to me. For months. You let me make a fool of myself in front of our friends.
---
## OLIVER:
No.
---
## ANNA:
Just so I would behave. So you could have a child. A child, above
everything else. Above our marriage. Above my sanity.
---
## OLIVER:
I was trying to help you!

Where do you think you’re going?
---
## ANNA:
The Singles Compound.
---
## OLIVER:
Anna! You can’t leave me over this. It was a a therapeutic tool—
---
## ANNA:
You let me walk around blind! For half a How could you possibly think I’d stay with you after that? I just need to stay
sane long enough to get aboveground. Then I will be 
You can’t construct your life around getting aboveground.
---
## ANNA:
I don’t care how long it takes. Ten years. If I can make it aboveground, I’ll be fine.
---
## OLIVER:
It won’t be ten years.
---
## ANNA:
However long. Fifteen, twenty.
---
## OLIVER:
It won’t be twenty years.
---
## OLIVER:
Buzzy. We can put this behind us. I know we can. We’ll have our baby. Everything will be fine.
---
## ANNA:
What do you mean, it won’t be twenty years?
---
## OLIVER:
Anna! We got our Fertility! We can finally, finally have our child. How is that not computing for you?
---
## ANNA:
What do you mean, it won’t be twenty years? Will it be longer?
---
## OLIVER:
I just meant, there’s no way of knowing how long it will take.
---
## ANNA:
That’s not what you meant. How much longer? Thirty years? 
---
## ANNA:
Forty years? How long?

---
## OLIVER:
We don’t know exactly.
---
## ANNA:

---
## OLIVER:
We’re estimating partial return in one hundred and fifty years. 
---
## OLIVER:
We’re trying for a breakthrough. A few times, I thought we were close. It’s not like we aren’t making progress. When I went to work for them, they were estimating over two hundred years. So. It’s possible it could be reduced.
---
## ANNA:
To what?
---
## OLIVER:
...Maybe one twenty.
---
## ANNA:
I don’t understand. I saw—I . It’s so green. There was water. How can we not be close?
You saw...what we wanted you to see.
---
## ANNA:
You only showed me the good part?
---
## OLIVER:
No. We Simmed for you. I found your stash of pills. I had to do something. Dr. Hernandez suggested—she’d done it before, with patients in a similar situation. It gave them hope. “A bridge to take you out of the worst of it.” That’s what she said. A bridge. It’s not that different from what we do for the general population. We’ve been letting it “leak” that we’re close for years. For decades. It keeps people happy. If we told them the truth... Can you imagine? I’ve wanted to tell you. Buzzy. I’ve wanted to tell you for so long.
---
## ANNA:
You Simmed for me? Without my permission?
---
## OLIVER:
No, you gave your permission. The documents you signed... 
---
## OLIVER:
Anna. Baby. Buzzy. I’m so sorry. I didn’t know what else to do. I couldn’t lose you.

---
## ANNA:
None of it was real?
---
## OLIVER:
Honey. Nothing has changed. Nothing is different. You just more now.
This is over.

You’re resting on the deck of a strong, slender boat. It cuts through the dark ocean, the sails snapping above you, white against the sky. Shhh. You can feel the light and warmth on you like an embrace. The water is holding the boat up and the boat is holding you up and you are holding the sunlight up, with every inch of your body.
You hear someone calling your name. “Judith.” It is your mother. She is coming toward you, bringing a bowl of peaches, cold from the fridge.
---
## CARRIE:
Is she asleep?
---
## ANNA:
Just.
---
## CARRIE:
Thank god.
Did you have a good nap?
---
## CARRIE:
Yes. Thank you. You’re so good with her. Your stories are better than a Sim. I wish you still lived close.
---
## ANNA:
Carrie.
---
## CARRIE:
I’m sorry. I just mean... No one told me how much I’d need my friends. 
---
## CARRIE:
That’ll be our vitamin delivery.
---
## ANNA:
You want me to get it?
---
## CARRIE:
No, I have to sign for it. I’ll be right back.

Judith. You’re going to sleep at least six hours tonight, okay? You’re going to give your mom a . The only ocean you will ever see will be a Sim. The only boat, the only sun, the only sky. Simulations. You will have that, and your imagination. Which is real, in its own way. I promise to tell you stories and give you books. I will fill your mind up with sunshine and sky. I will give you other . I will give you I will give you I will give you all the pictures I have in my brain, which I only have because someone once chose to write them down. How it felt to walk through a field at sunrise, leading a horse to water. How it felt to watch a room full of people waltzing in unison. How it was when we were embarrassingly rich, and didn’t even know it.
What is he doing here?
---
## CARRIE:
I’m sorry—
---
## OLIVER:
Anna.
---
## CARRIE:
I mentioned you were coming over—
---
## ANNA:
You told him!
Please don’t shout—
---
## OLIVER:
It’s not her fault, she didn’t know I was coming.
---
## ANNA:
No?
---
## CARRIE:
Of course not!
---
## OLIVER:
She wouldn’t have let me.
---
## ANNA:
You let him in!
---
## CARRIE:

keep your voices down.

---
## OLIVER:
I’ve been out to the Singles Compound. They wouldn’t tell me where you were.
---
## ANNA:
Because I didn’t want you to find me.
---
## OLIVER:
I just wanted to see how you were.
---
## ANNA:
I’m fine. See? Now go.
---
## OLIVER:
Please. Hear me out. Five minutes. You never have to see me again if you don’t want to.
How have you been?
---
## ANNA:
Fine.
---
## OLIVER:
Really?
---
## ANNA:
Yes. Mercedes has been taking me to work with her. To help out.
---
## OLIVER:
Teaching?
---
## ANNA:
Yes. I’m good at it. They’ve asked me to come back full-time in the fall.
---
## OLIVER:
Will you?
---
## ANNA:
Haven’t decided.
---
## OLIVER:
I’ve been terrible. I can’t sleep or eat. I can’t work. They put me on suspension. I haven’t been to work in over a week.
---
## ANNA:
Well, that must be nice for you. To finally get a break.
---
## OLIVER:
They don’t want me there because I am useless. All I can think about is what I did to you. It runs around and around in my brain. I wish
there was a way to make you understand how sorry I am.
---
## ANNA:
There isn’t.

---
## OLIVER:
There must be.
---
## ANNA:
What are you doing?
---
## OLIVER:
Begging your forgiveness.
---
## ANNA:
This isn’t about forgiveness. I trusted you with my . That’s what I gave you when I married you. My . You broke that trust. I don’t know you anymore.
---
## OLIVER:
You do. You know me.
---
## ANNA:
I don’t know the person who would do that to me. Lie to me like that. That person is a complete stranger to me.
I had an idea of happiness. A picture in my mind. Of you and me and our kid. How we would make this perfect unit, a circle with no one left on the outside. The longer we waited for a baby, the stronger that picture became. And the sadder you got, the more important it seemed. We had to have a baby, it would make you happy again. Whole again. It was the only answer. It was heaven. That’s what it felt like to me. I thought if I got you over that line, and we could get our baby... Heaven. Nothing else seemed important. You say you felt blinded by me—I was the one who was blind. You say that you didn’t recognize the person who would do such a thing. I no longer recognized myself. Now I just want to be with you. Present with you. However you are feeling. I’m not being clear. I want to make you happy, but I don’t need you to be happy. I want to with you. I think I stopped being you a long time ago. I let you talk to a machine instead of me. And I don’t want to do that anymore. Please, will you please consider coming home, and letting me try again to be with you?
I don’t know how to trust you.
---
## OLIVER:
Give me an inch. I will earn the rest. I promise.
---
## ANNA:
I don’t know how.

---
## OLIVER:
Take a step toward me. Any step. Come home for a day. Come home for an hour. Talk to me. Try me.
Will you tell me something?
---
## OLIVER:
Anything.
---
## ANNA:
What is it like on the surface? Not in one hundred years. Not before, when things were good. Now.
---
## OLIVER:
Now.
---
## ANNA:
Yes.
---
## OLIVER:
Everything is frozen. Ice, everywhere. The ozone layer is healing, but very slowly. There is a very high level of carbon monoxide in the air. That and the cold have killed off most of the plant life. Everything else—the ice and water and earth and air—are all contaminated from nuclear fallout. That is what we are working on the hardest, because it is something we understand. The rest will simply take time.
Because the oceans rose so precipitously, even if we manage to clean everything up, the lines of the continents will look different from before. Nothing recognizable will remain. Years and years down the line, a very long time from now, the people who have survived will have to build everything from absolutely nothing. It will be very, very hard. Almost impossible. Those people who dare to go back aboveground will have to be incredibly brave—maybe foolish. Everything we are doing now is to prepare for that moment. All of our work, all our effort is directed to that far distant point. We exist now to prepare for those who come after, so they can be stronger and better than we are. And so they remember. That’s why our lives matter. To keep life going. And make the next generation a little better.
 ---
## ANNA:
That’s all?
---
## OLIVER:
No. Our lives also matter because they matter to us. To the people who love us. Your life matters to me. Does it matter to you?
