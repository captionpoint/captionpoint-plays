.bigger[
  The Duchess of Malfi
]
by John Webster

---
---

## DELIA:	
The presence 'gins to fill: you promis'd me 
To make me the partaker of the natures
Of some of your great courtiers.

---

## ANT:	
I shall.

---

## DELIA:	
What's that Cardinal?

---


I mean his temper? They say he's a brave fellow, 

---

Will play his five thousand crowns at tennis, dance,

---


Court ladies, and one that hath fought single combats.

---

## ANT:	
Some such flashes superficially hang on him, for form; 

---

But observe his inward character: he is a melancholy Churchman; 

---

the spring in his face is nothing but the Engendering of toads; 

---

where he is jealous of any man, He lays worse plots for him than ever was imposed on Hercules, 

---

for he strews in his way flatterers, panders, Intelligencers, atheists, and a thousand such political Monsters. 

---

He should have been Pope, but instead of Coming to it by the primitive decency of the church,

---


He did bestow bribes so largely, and so impudently, as if he would Have carried it away without heaven's knowledge.

---


Some good he hath done -

---

## DELIA:	
You have given too much of him: what's his brother? 

---

## ANT:
The duke there? a most perverse and turbulent nature:
What appears in him mirth is merely outside;

---


If he laugh heartily, it is to laugh All honesty out of fashion.

---

## DELIA:	
Twins?

---

## ANT:	
In quality.

---


He speaks with others' tounges, and hears men's suits With others' ears; 

---

will seem to sleep o' th' bench Only to entrap offenders in their answers;

---


Dooms men to death by information,
Rewards by hearsay.

---

## DELIA:	
Then the law to him
Is like a foul black cobweb to a spider, 

---

He makes it his dwelling and a prison To entangle those shall feed him.

---

## ANT:	
Most true:
He never pays debts unless they be shrewd turns, 

---

And those he will confess that he doth owe.

---


Last, for his brother there, the cardinal, 

---

They that do flatter him most say oracles Hang at his lips;

---

and verily I believe them, For the devil speaks in them.

---


But for their sister, the right noble duchess, 

---

You never fix'd your eye on three fair medals 

---

Cast in one figure, of so different temper.

---


For her discourse, it is so full of rapture, 

---

You only will begin then to be sorry


---

When she doth end her speech, and wish, in wonder, 

---

She held it less vain-glory, to talk much,


---

Than your penance to hear her: and to dote 

---

On that sweet countenance; but in that look 

---

There speaketh so divine a continence,


---

As cuts off all lascivious and vain hope. 

---

Her days are practis'd in such noble virtue,


---

That sure her nights, nay more, her very sleeps, 

---

Are more in heaven, than other ladies' shrifts.

---


Let all sweet ladies break their flattering glasses,

---

And dress themselves in her.

---

## DELIA:	
Fie, Antonio,
You play the wire-drawer with her commendation.

---

## ANT:	
I'll case the picture up: only thus much,


---

All her particular worth, grows to this sum;


---

She stains the time past, lights the time to come. 

---

Here comes Bosola, the only court-gall.

---


Yet, I observe his railing is not for simple love of piety; 

---

Indeed, he rails at those things which he wants.

---

## DEL:	
I knew this lady seven years in the gallies
For a notorious murder; and 'twas thought 

---

The Cardinal suborn'd it: she was releas'd 

---

By the French general, Gaston de Foix, 

---

When he recover'd Naples.

---

## ANT:	
'Tis great pity,
She should be thus neglected: I have heard 

---

She's very valiant.
This foul melancholy
Will poison all her goodness; for, I'll tell you, 

---

If too immoderate sleep be truly said


---

To be an inward rust unto the soul, 

---

It then doth follow want of action


---

Breeds all black malcontents, and their close rearing, 

---

Like moths in cloth, do hurt for want of wearing.

---

## BOS:	
I do haunt you still.

---

## CARD:	
So.

---

## BOS:	
I have done you better service 

---

Than to be slighted thus.

---


Miserable age, where only the reward 

---

Of doing well, is the doing of it!

---

## CARD:	
You enforce your merit too much. 

---

## BOS:
I fell into the gallies in your service,


---

Where, for two years together, I wore


---

Two towels instead of a shirt, with a knot on the shoulder, 

---

After the fashion of a Roman mantle.

---


Slighted thus! I will thrive some way: 

---

Black-birds fatten best in hard weather; 

---

Why not I in these dog-days?

---

## CARD:	
Would you could become honest! 

---

## BOS:

With all your divinity do but direct me


---

The way to it. I have known many travel far for it,


---

And yet return as arrant knaves as they went forth, 

---

Because they carried themselves always along with them.

---



Are you gone?

---


Some fellows, they say, are possessed with the devil, 

---

But this great fellow were able to possess the greatest Devil, and make him worse.

---

## ANT:	
He hath denied thee some suit?

---

## BOS:	
He and his brother are like plum-trees that grow crooked Over standing-pools; 

---

they are rich, and o'erladen with Fruit, but none but crows, pies, and caterpillars feed
On them. 

---

Could I be one of their flattering panders, I
Would hang on their ears like a horseleech, 

---

till I were full, and Then drop off. I pray leave me.

---


Who would rely upon these miserable dependencies; in expectation to Be advanced to-morrow? 

---

What creature ever fed worse, than hoping Tantalus? 

---

nor ever died any man more fearfully, than he that hoped For a pardon. 

---

There are rewards for hawks and dogs,
When they have done us service: 

---

but for a soldier that hazards her Limbs in a battle, 

---

nothing but a kind of geometry is her last Supportation.

---

## DELIA:	
Geometry!

---

## BOS:	
Ay, to hang in a fair pair of slings, take their latter swing in the World upon an honourable pair of crutches, from hospital To hospital. 

---

Fare ye well: and yet do not you scorn us, for Places in the court are but like beds in the hospital, 

---

where this Man's head lies at that man's foot, 

---

and so lower and lower.

---

## FERD:	
Sister, I have a suit to you.

---

## DUCH:	
To me, sir?

---

## FERD:	
A chevalier here, Danielle de Bosola, One that was in the gallies

---

## DUCH:	
Yes, I know her.

---

## FERD:	
A worthy soldier she'is: pray let me entreat for
The provisorship of your horse.

---

## DUCH:	
Your knowledge of her
Commends her and prefers her.

---

## DUCH:	
You must attend your lady in the gallery, Some half an hour hence.

---

## ANT:	
I shall.

---

## CARD:	
Be sure you entertain that Bosola
For your intelligence: 

---

I would not be seen in't; And therefore many times I have slighted her,


---

When she did court our furtherance, as this morning.

---

## FERD:	
Antonio, the great master of her household, Had been far fitter.

---

## CARD:	
You are deceiv'd in them:
Their nature is too honest for such business. 

---

She comes.

---

## BOS:	
I was lur'd to you.

---

## FERD:	
My brother here, the cardinal could never Abide you.

---

## BOS:	
Never since he was in my debt.

---

## FERD:	
May be some oblique character in your face Made him suspect you.

---

## BOS:	
Doth he study physiognomy? He did suspect me wrongfully.

---

## FERD:	
For that
You must give great men leave to take their times. 

---

Distrust doth cause us seldom be deceiv'd:


---

You see, the oft shaking of the cedar-tree Fastens it more at root.

---

## BOS:	
Yet, take heed;
For to suspect a friend unworthily, 

---

Instructs him the next way to suspect you, 

---

And prompts him to deceive you.

---

## FERD:	
There's gold.

---

## BOS:	
So,
What follows? never rain'd such showers as these 

---

Without thunderbolts i' th' tail of them:
whose throat must I cut?

---

## FERD:	
Your inclination to shed blood rides post Before my occasion to use you. 

---

I give you that
To live i'th' court here, and observe the duchess; 

---

To note all the particulars of her 'haviour,
What suitors do solicit her for marriage,


---

And whom she best affects. 

---

She's a young widow: I would not have her marry again.

---

## BOS:	
No, sir?

---

## FERD:	
Do not you ask the reason; but be satisfied I say I would not.

---

## BOS:	
It seems you would create me One of your familiars.

---

## FERD:	
Familiar! what's that?

---

## BOS:	
Why, a very quaint invisible devil in flesh; As intelligencer.

---

## FERD:	
Such a kind of thriving thing
I would wish thee; and ere long, 

---

thou may'st arrive At a higher place by't.

---

## BOS:	
Take your devils,
Which hell calls angels: 

---

these curs'd gifts would make You a corrupter, me an impudent traitor;


---

And should I take these, they'd take me to hell.

---

## FERD:	
Ma’am, I'll take nothing from you, that I have given: 

---

There is a place that I procur'd for you
This morning, is't not worth thanks?

---

## BOS:	
I would have you curse yourself now, that your bounty. 

---

(Which makes men truly noble) e'er should make
Me a villain. 

---

O, that to avoid ingratitude
For the good deed you have done me, 

---

I must do All the ill man can invent! Thus the devil Candies all sins o'er; 

---

and what heaven terms vile That names he complemental.

---

## FERD:	
Be yourself;
Keep your old garb of melancholy; 

---

'twill express You envy those that stand above your reach,


---

Yet strive not to come near 'em: this will gain Access to private lodgings, 

---

where yourself May, like a politic dormouse -

---

## BOS:	
As I have seen some,
Feed in a lord's dish, half asleep, 

---

not seeming To listen to any talk; 

---

and yet these rogues
Have cut his throat in a dream. 

---

What's my place? I am your creature.

---

## FERD:	
Away.

---

## BOS:	
Let good men, for good deeds, covet good fame, 

---

Since place and riches, oft are bribes of shame: 

---

Sometimes the devil doth preach.

---

## CARD:	
We are to part from you; and your own discretion Must now be your director.

---

## FERD:	
You are a widow: You know already what man is; 

---

and therefore Let not youth, high promotion, eloquence
---

## CARD:	
No,
Nor anything without the addition, honour, 

---

Sway your high blood.

---

## FERD:	
Marry! they are most luxurious, Will wed twice.

---

## CARD:	
O, fie!

---

## FERD:	
Their livers are more spotted
Than Laban's sheep.

---

## DUCH:	
Diamonds are of most value,


---

They say, that have past through most jewellers' hands.

---

## FERD:	
Whores, by that rule, are precious. 

---

## DUCH:
Will you hear me?

---


I'll never marry man.

---

## CARD:	
So most widows say;


---

But commonly that motion lasts no longer
Than the turning of an hour-glass: 

---

the funeral sermon And it, end both together.

---

## FERD:	
Now hear me:
You live in a rank pasture here, i'th' court; 

---

There is a kind of honey-dew that's deadly;


---

'Twill posion your fame; look to't: be not cunning; 

---

For they whose faces do belie their hearts,
Are witches ere they arrive at twenty years, 

---

Ay, and give the devil suck.

---

## DUCH:	
This is terrible good counsel.

---

## FERD:	
Hypocrisy is woven of a fine small thread, 

---

Subtler than Vulcan's engine: yet, believ't,


---

Your darkest actions, nay, your privat'st thoughts, Will come to light.

---

## CARD:	
You may flatter yourself, 

---

And take your own choice; privately be married Under the eaves of night

---

## FERD:	
Think't the best voyage
That e'er you made; 

---

like the irregular crab,
Which, though't goes backward, 

---

thinks that it goes right, Because it goes its own way: 

---

but observe,
Such weddings may more properly be said To be executed, than celebrated.

---

## CARD:	
The marriage night
Is the entrance into some prison.

---

## FERD:	
And those joys,


---

Those lustful pleasures, are like heavy sleeps Which do forerun man's mischief.

---

## CARD:	
Fare you well.

---


Wisdom begins at the end: remember it.

---

## DUCH:	
I think this speech between you both was studied, It came so roundly off.

---

## FERD:	
You are my sister;
This was my father's poinard, do you see?

---


I'd be loath to see't look rusty, 'cause 'twas his.

---


I would have you to give o'er these chargeable revels, 

---

A visor and a mask are whispering rooms
That were never built for goodness;

---

—fare ye well, And beware that part, which like the lamprey, 

---

Hath never a bone in't.

---

## DUCH:	
Fie, sir.

---

## FERD:	
Nay, I mean the tongue; variety of courtship; 

---

What cannot a neat knave with a smooth tale Make a woman believe: 

---

Farewell, lusty widow.

---

## DUCH:	
Shall this move me? If all my royal kindred Lay in my way unto this marriage,


---

I'd make them my low footsteps; and even now, 

---

Even in this hate, as men in some great battles,


---

By apprehending danger, have achiev'd
Almost impossible actions,- I have heard soldiers say so,- 

---

So I through frights and threatenings will assay
This dangerous venture. 

---

Let old wives report I wink'd, and chose a partner.

---


I am going into a wilderness


---

Where I shall find no path, nor friendly clew, To be my guide.

---

## DUCH:	
I sent for you: sit down;


---

Take pen and ink, and write: are you ready?

---

## ANT:	
Yes.

---

## DUCH:	
What did I say?

---

## ANT:	
That I should write somewhat.

---

## DUCH:	
O, I remember.

---


After these triumphs and this large expense, It's fit, like thrifty husbands, 

---

we inquire What's laid up for to-morrow.

---

## ANT:	
So please your beauteous excellence. 

---

## DUCH:
Beauteous! 

---

Indeed I thank you:
I look young for your sake;


---

You have ta'en my cares upon you.

---

## ANT:	
I'll fetch your grace
The particulars of your revenue and expence.

---

## DUCH:	
O, you are
An upright treasurer; but you mistook: 

---

For when I said I meant to make inquiry What's laid up for to-morrow, 

---

I did mean What's laid up yonder for me.

---

## ANT:	
Where?

---

## DUCH:	
In heaven.

---


I am making my will (as 'tis fit princes should, In perfect memory) and, I pray, tell me


---

Were not one better make it smiling, thus,
Than in deep groans, and terrible ghastly looks, 

---

As if the gifts we parted with procur'd
That violent distraction?

---

## ANT:	
O, much better.

---

## DUCH:	
If I had a husband now, this care were quit: But I intend to make you overseer.

---


What good deed shall we first remember? say.

---

## ANT:	
Begin with that first good deed begun i'th'world After man's creation, 

---

the sacrament of marriage: I'd have you first provide for a good husband; Give him all.

---

## DUCH:	
All?

---

## ANT:	
Yes, your excellent self.

---

## DUCH:	
St. Winifred, that were a strange will! 

---

## ANT:
'Twere strange if there were no will in you
To marry again.

---

## DUCH:	
What do you think of marriage? 

---

## ANT:
I take't, as those that deny purgatory,
It locally contains, or heaven, or hell, There's no third place in't.

---

## DUCH:	
Fie, fie, what's all this?

---


One of your eyes is blood-shot; use my ring to't, They say 'tis very sovereign: 

---

'twas my wedding ring, And I did vow never to part with it
But to my second husband. 

---

## ANT:
You have parted with it now.

---

## DUCH
Yes, to help your eye-sight. 

---

## ANT:
You have made me stark blind. 

---

## DUCH:
How?

---

## ANT:	
There is a saucy and ambitious devil, Is dancing in this circle.

---

## DUCH:	
Remove him.

---

## ANT:	
How?

---

## DUCH:	
There needs small conjuration, when your finger May do it; thus; is it fit?

---

## ANT:	
What said you? O, my unworthiness! 

---

## DUCH:
You were ill to sell yourself:
This darkening of your worth is not like that


---

Which tradesmen use i'th' city; their false lights Are to rid bad wares off.

---

## ANT:	
Were there nor heaven nor hell,
I should be honest: I have long serv'd virtue, And ne'er ta'en wages of her.

---

## DUCH:	
Now she pays it.

---


The misery of us that are born great!

---


We are forc'd to woo, because none dare woo us; And as a tyrant doubles with his words,


---

And fearfully equivocates, so we
Are forc'd to express our violent passions
In riddles, 

---

and in dreams, and leave the path Of simple virtue, which was never made
To seem the thing it is not. 

---

Go, go brag
You have left me heartless; mine is in your bosom: I hope 'twill multiply love there. 

---

You do tremble: Make not your heart so dead a piece of flesh,
To fear, more than to love me. 

---

Be confident: What is't distracts you? This is flesh and blood; 

---

'Tis not the figure cut in alabaster,
Kneels at my husbands tomb. Awake, awake, love!

---


I do here put off all vain ceremony,
And only do appear to you a young widow


---

That claims you for her spouse, and like a widow, I use but half a blush in't.

---

## ANT:	
Truth speak for me:
I will remain the constant sanctuary Of your good name.

---

## DUCH:	
I thank you, gentle love:
and 'cause you shall not come to me in debt, Being now my steward, here upon your lips
I sign your Quietus est. This you should have begg'd now; I have seen children oft eat sweetmeats thus,
As fearful to devour them too soon.

---

## ANT:	
But for your brothers?

---

## DUCH:	
Do not think of them:
All discord without this circumference Is only to be pitied, and not fear'd:
Yet, should they know it, time will easily Scatter the tempest.

---

## ANT:	
These words should be mine,
And all the parts you have spoke, if some part of it Would not have savour'd flattery.

---

## DUCH:	
Kneel.

---

## ANT:	
Ha!

---

## DUCH:	
Be not amaz'd, this woman's of my counsel:
I have heard lawyers say, a contract in a chamber Per verba presenti is absolute marriage.

---


Bless, heaven, this sacred gordian, which let violence Never untwine!

---

## ANT:	
And may our sweet affections, like the spheres, Be still in motion.

---

## DUCH:	
Quickening, and make The like soft music.

---

## ANT:	
That we may imitate the loving palms, Best emblem of a peaceful marriage That never bore fruit divided.

---

## DUCH:	
What can the church force more?

---

## ANT:	
That fortune may not know an accident Either of joy, or sorrow, to divide
Our fixed wishes.

---

## DUCH:	
How can the church build faster?

---


We now are married, and ‘tis the church That must echo this.

---


Maid, stand apart:
I now am blind.

---

## ANT:	
What's your conceit in this?

---

## DUCH:	
I would have you lead your Fortune by the hand Unto your marriage bed:
(You speak in me this, for we now are one:) We'll only lie, and talk together, and plot T'appease my humourous kindred.

---


O, let me shrowd my blushes in your bosom, Since 'tis the treasury of all my secrets!

---

## DEL:	
And so long since married!

---


You amaze me.

---

## ANT:	
Let me seal your lips for ever:
For did I think, that anything but th' air
Could carry these words from you, I should wish You had no breath at all.

---


How I do play the fool with mine own danger! You are this night, dear friend, to post to Rome, To discover what, I know not. But to intelligence
If it is know what my dear lady wife and I have concealed From those who would wish us misfortune.

---


My life lies in your service.

---

## DEL:	
I have friends who hold the ear of the cardinal, And have knowledge of his most private deeds. Do not doubt me.

---

## ANT:	
O, 'tis far from me! and yet fear presents me Somewhat that looks like danger.

---

## DEL:	
Believe it,
'Tis but the shadow of your fear, no more:
How superstitiously we mind our evils!

---


The throwing down salt, or crossing of a hare, 

---

Bleeding at nose, the stumbling of a horse,


---

Or singing of a cricket, are of power
To daunt whole man in us. 

---

Friend, fare you well: I wish you all the joys of a blest lover;


---

And, for my faith, lay this unto your breast,
Old friends, like old swords, still are trusted best.

---

## ANT:	
I heard some noise. Who's there? what art thou? speak. 

---

## BOS:
Antonio? put not your face nor body
To such a forc'd expression of fear:
I am Bosola, your friend.

---

## ANT:	
Bosola!

---


This mole does undermine me.

---

## BOS:	
Methinks 'tis very cold, and yet you sweat.

---


You look wildly.

---

## ANT:	
What's that to you?

---


'Tis rather to be question'd what design, Makes you a night-walker.

---

## BOS:	
In sooth I'll tell you:
Now all the court’s asleep, I thought the devil Had least to do here. I came to say my prayers, And if it do offend you I do so,
You are a fine courtier.

---

## ANT:	
This fellow will undo me.

---


Traitors are ever confident til they are discovered.

---

## BOS:	
You are a false steward.

---

## ANT:	
Saucy druge, I'll pull thee up by the roots. 

---

## BOS:
Maybe the ruin will crush you to pieces. 

---

## ANT:
You are an impudent snake indeed.

---

## BOS:	
Are you scarce warm, and do you show your sting? 

---

## ANT:
You libel well, ma’am.

---

## BOS:	
No: copy it out,
And I will set my hand to't.	

---

## ANT:	
My nose bleeds.

---


One that were superstitious would count
This ominous, when it merely comes by chance: Mere accident. 

---

Madam, this door you pass not: I do not hold it fit that you come near
The duchess' lodgings, 

---

till you have quit yourself. The great are like the base, nay, they are the same, 

---

When they seek shameful ways to avoid shame.

---

## BOS:	
Antonio hereabout did drop a paper:—
Some of your help, false friend.

---

—O, here it is. What 's here? a woman’s nativity calculated!

---


[Reads.]
'The duchess was deliver'd, 'tween the hours twelve and one in the night, Anno Dom. 1504, 

---

'decimo nono Decembris,'
'taken according to the meridian of Malfi,

---

'—that 's our duchess: happy discovery!—

---

'The lord of the first house being combust in the ascendant, signifies short life;


---

and Mars being in a human sign, joined to the tail of the Dragon, 

---

in the eighth house, doth threaten a violent death. 

---

This accompanying nativity is so obscured by blood that no intelligence can be obtained, 

---

beyond the general
concord of their union.

---


Why, now 'tis most apparent; Antonio
Is the duchess' bawd:—I have it to my wish! 

---

This is a parcel of intelligency
Our courtiers were cas'd up for:


---

If one could find the husband now! but that Time will discover. Old Castruccio
I' th' morning posts to Rome: 

---

by him I'll send A letter that shall make her brothers' galls O'erflow their livers. This was a thrifty way!

---


Though lust do mask in ne'er so strange disguise, She 's oft found witty, but is never wise.

---

## CARD:	
Sit: thou art my best of wishes. Prithee tell me, What trick didst thou invent to come here Without thy husband?

---

## JULIA:	
Why, my lord, I told him
I came to visit an old anchorite Here, for devotion.

---

## CARD:	
Thou art a witty false one;
I mean, to him.

---

## JULIA:	
You have prevail'd with me
Beyond my strongest thoughts: I would not now Find you inconstant.


---

## CARD:	
Do not put thyself
To such a voluntary torture, which proceeds Out of your own guilt.

---

## JULIA:	
How, my lord?

---

## CARD:	
Sooth, generally; for women,
A man might strive to make glass malleable, Ere he should make them fixed.

---

## JULIA:	
So, my lord.

---

## CARD:	
We had need go borrow that fantastic glass, Invented by Galileo the Florentine,
To view another spacious world i'th' moon, And look to find a constant woman there.

---

## JULIA:	
This is very well, my lord. 

---

## CARD:
Why do you weep?

---


Are tears your justification? the self-same tears
Will fall into your husband's bosom, lady, 


---

With a loud protestation that you love him
Above the world. 


---

Come, I'll love you wisely: That's jealousy; since I am very certain
You cannot make me cuckold.

---

## JULIA:	
I'll go home
To my husband.

---

## CARD:	
You may thank me, lady:
I have taken you off your melancholy perch, 

---

Bore you upon my fist, and shew'd you game, And let you fly at it.- 

---

I pray thee kiss me.-
When thou was't with thy husband, 

---

thou was't watch'd Like a tame elephant:- (still you are to thank me:)- 

---

Thou hadst only kisses from him, and high feeding; But what delight was that? 

---

'twas just like one
That hath a little fingering on the lute,
Yet cannot tune it:- 

---

still you are to thank me.

---

## JULIA:	
You told me of a piteous wound i'th' heart, And a sick liver, when you woo'd me first, And spake like one in physic.

---



[A knock]

---

## CARD:	
Who's that?-

---

[SERVANT’s voice offstage]

---

Serv.	Madam, gentlefolk,
That's come post from Malfi, desires to see you.

---


She says your husband, Old Castruccios is coming to Rome, Most pitifully tired with riding post.

---

## CARD:	
Rest firm, for my affection to thee, Lightning moves slow to't.

---


Let them enter: I'll withdraw.

---

## JULIA:	
Delia! 'tis one of my old suitors. Delia.	I was bold to come and see you.

---

## JULIA:	
You are welcome. Delia.	Do you lie here?

---

## JULIA:	
Sure, your own experience Will satisfy you, no: our Catholic prelates
Do not keep lodging for ladies.

---

## DELIA:	
Very well:
I have brought you no commendations from your husband, For I know none by him.

---

## JULIA:	
I hear he's come to Rome.

---

## DELIA:	
I never knew man and beast, of a horse and a knight, So weary of each other; if he had had a good back, He would have undertook to have borne his horse, His breech was so pitifully sore.

---

## JULIA:	
Your laughter
Is my pity.

---

## DELIA:	
Lady, I know not whether
You want money, but I have bought you some.

---

## JULIA:	
From my husband?

---

## DELIA:	
No, from mine own allowance.

---

## JULIA:	
I must hear the condition, ere I be bound to take it. Delia.	Look on't, 'tis gold; hath it not a fine colour?

---

## JULIA:	
I have a bird more beautiful. Delia.	Try the sound on't.

---

## JULIA:	
A lute-spring far exceeds it:
It hath no smell, like cassia, or civet;


---

Nor is it physical, though some fond doctors Persuade us seeth't in cullises. 

---

I'll tell you,
This is a creature bred by-	

---

[FERDINAND screams off stage]



---

[SERVANT knock outside the door, voice only]

---

## SERV:	
Your husband's come,
Hath deliver'd a letter to the Duke of Calabria, That to my thinking, hath put him out of his wits.

---

## JULIA:	
Delia, you hear:
Pray let me know your business, and your suit, As briefly as can be.

---

## DELIA:	
With good speed, I would wish you, At such time as you are non-resident With your husband, my mistress.

---

## JULIA:	
I'll go ask my husband if I shall, And straight return your answer.

---

## DELIA:	
Very fine.

---


Is this her wit, or honesty, that speaks thus? I imagine the duke was highly mov'd
With a letter sent from Malfi. 

---

I do fear Antonio is betray'd: how fearfully
Shews their ambition now! Unfortunate fortune!

---


They pass through whirlpools, and deep woes do shun, Who the event weigh, ere the action's done.

---

## FERD:	
I have this night digg'd up a mandrake. 

---

## CARD:
Say you?

---

## FERD:	
And I am grown mad with't.

---

## CARD:	
What's the prodigy?

---

## FERD:	
Read there, a sister damn'd: she's loose i'th' hilts; Grown a notorious strumpet.

---

## CARD:	
Speak lower.

---

## FERD:	
Lower!

---


Rogues do not whisper't now, but seek to publish't (As servants do the bounty of their lords)
Aloud; 

---

and with a covetous searching eye,
To mark who note them. 

---

O, confusion seize her! She hath had most cunning bawds to serve her turn, 

---

And more secure conveyances for lust,
Than towns of garrison for service.

---

## CARD:	
Is't possible?

---


Can this be certain?

---

## FERD:	
Rhubarb, O, for rhubarb,
To purge this choler! here's the cursed day To prompt my memory; 

---

and here't shall stick Till of her bleeding heart I make a sponge To wipe it out.

---

## CARD:	
Why do you make yourself
So wild a tempest?

---

## FERD:	
Would I could be one,
That I might toss her palace 'bout her ears, 

---

Root up her goodly forests, blast her meads, 

---

And lay her general territory as waste,


---

As she hath done her honours.

---

## CARD:	
Shall our blood,
The royal blood of Arragon and Castile, 

---

Be thus attainted?

---

## FERD:	
Methinks I see her laughing: Excellent hyena! Talk to me somewhat, quickly, 

---

Or my imagination will carry me
To see her in the shameful act of sin.

---

## CARD:	
With whom?

---

## FERD:	
Happily with some strong-thigh'd bargeman,


---

Or one o'th' wood-yard, that can quoit the sledge,


---

Or toss the bar, or else some lovely squire That carries coals up to her privy lodgings.

---

## CARD:	
You fly beyond your reason.

---

## FERD:	
Go to, mistress!

---


'Tis not your whore's milk that shall quench my wild-fire, But your whore's blood.

---

## CARD:	
How idly shews this rage, which carries you, 

---

As men convey'd by witches through the air, 

---

On violent whirlwinds!

---

## FERD:	
Have not you my palsy?

---

## CARD:	
Yes; I can be angry Without this rupture: 

---

there is not in nature
A thing that makes man so deform'd, 

---

so beastly, As doth intemperate anger. Chide yourself.

---


Come, put yourself in tune.

---

## FERD:	
I could kill her now,
In you, or in myself; 

---

for I do think
It is some sin in us, heaven doth revenge By her.

---

## CARD:	
Are you stark mad? 

---

## FERD:
I would have their bodies
Burnt in a coal-pit with the ventage stopp'd,


---

That their curs'd smoke might not ascend to heaven; 

---

## CARD:
I'll leave you.

---

## FERD:	
Nay, I have done.

---


I am confident, had I been damn'd in hell,
And should have heard of this, 

---

it would have put me Into a cold sweat. 

---

In, in, I'll go sleep.

---


Till I know who leaps my sister, 

---

I'll not stir:
That known, 

---

I'll find scorpions to string my whips, And fix her in a general eclipse.

---

## ANT:	
Our noble friend, my most beloved Delia! 

---

O, you have been a stranger long at court: 

---

Came you along with the Lord Ferdinand?

---

## DELIA:	
I did, friend: and how fares your noble duchess? 

---

## ANT:
Right fortunately well.

---

## DELIA:	
Let me but wink,
And not behold your face, which to mine eye Is somewhat leaner. 

---

Pray, tell me,
Hath not this news arriv'd tet to the ear Of the lord Cardinal?

---

## ANT:	
I fear it hath:
The Lord Ferdinand, that's newly come to court, 

---

Doth bear himself right dangerously.

---

## DELIA:	
Pray, why?

---

## ANT:	
He is so quiet, that he seems to sleep
The tempest out, as dormice do in winter: 

---

These houses that are haunted, 

---

are most still Till the devil be up.

---

## DELIA:	
What say the common people? 

---

## ANT:
The common rabble do directly say
She is a strumpet.

---

## DELIA:	
And your graver heads,
Which would be politic, what censure they?

---

## ANT:	
They do observe, I grow to infinite purchase, 

---

The left hand way; and all suppose the duchess Would amend it, 

---

if she could: for, say they, Great princes, though they grudge their officers 

---

Should have such large and unconfined means 

---

To get wealth under them, will not complain,


---

Lest thereby they should make them odious Unto the people; for other obligation


---

Of love or marriage, between her and me, They never dream of.

---

## FERD:	
I'll instantly to bed,
For I am weary. I am to bespeak A husband for you.

---

## DUCH:	
For me, sir! pray who is't? 

---

## FERD:
The great Count Malateste. 

---

## DUCH:
Fie upon him:
A count! he's a mere stick of sugar-candy;
You may look quite through him. When I choose A husband, I will marry for your honour.

---

## FERD:	
You shall do well in't. How is't, worthy Antonio?

---

## DUCH:	
But, sir, I am to have private conference with you About a scandalous report is spread
Touching mine honour.

---

## FERD:	
Let me be ever deaf to't:
One of Pasquil's paper-bullets, court-calumny, 

---

A pestilent air, which princes' palaces
Are seldom purg'd of. 

---

Yet, say that it were true, I pour it in your bosom: my fix'd love
Would strongly excuse, extenuate, nay, deny Faults, 

---

were they apparent in you. Go, be safe In your own innocency.

---

## DUCH:	
O bless'd comfort!

---


This deadly air is purg'd.

---

## FERD:	
Her guilt treads on
Hot burning culters. Now, Bosola, How thrives our intelligence?

---

## BOS:	
Sir, uncertainly:
I do suspect, there hath been some sorcery Us'd on the duchess.

---

## FERD:	
Sorcery! to what purpose?

---

## BOS:	
To make her dote on some desertless fellow, She shames to acknowledge.

---

## FERD:	
Can your faith give way
To think there's power in potions, or in charms, To make us love whether we will or no?

---

## BOS:	
Most certainly.

---

## FERD:	
Away, these are mere gulleries, horrid things, Invented by some cheating mountebanks,
To abuse us. Do you think that herbs, or charms, Can force the will?

---


The witch-craft lies in her rank blood. This night I will force confession from her. You told me You had got, within these two days, a false key Into her bedchamber.

---

## BOS:	
I have.

---

## FERD:	
As I would wish.

---

## BOS:	
What do you intend to do?

---

## FERD:	
Can you guess?

---

## BOS:	
No.

---

## FERD:	
Do not ask then:
He that can compass me, and know my drifts, May say he hath put a girdle 'bout the world, And sounded all her quicksands.

---

## BOS:	
I do not think so.

---

## FERD:	
What do you think, then, pray? 

---

## BOS:
That you are
Your own chronicle too much, and grossly Flatter yourself.

---

## FERD:	
Give me thy hand; I thank thee:
I never gave pension but to flatterers,


---

Till I entertained thee. 

---

Farewell.	


---

That friend a great man's ruin strongly checks, Who rails into his belief all his defects.

---

## DUCH:	
Bring me the casket hither, and the glass. You get no lodging here to night, my love.

---

## ANT:	
Indeed, I must persuade one. 

---

## DUCH:
Very good:
I hope in time 'twill grow into a custom,
That noblemen shall come with cap and knee, 

---

To purchase a night's lodging of their wives.

---

## ANT:	
I must lie here.

---

## DUCH:	
Must! you are a lord of misrule. 

---

## ANT:
Indeed, my rule is only in the night. 

---

## DUCH:
To what use will you put me?

---

## ANT:	
We'll sleep together.

---

## DUCH:	
Alas,
What pleasure can two lovers find in sleep! Love, shall I ask you a question?

---

## ANT:	
Ay, pray thee.

---

## DUCH:	
Wherefore still, when you lie with me
Do you rise so early?

---

## ANT:	
Labouring folks
Count the clock oftenest;
Are glad when their task's ended.

---

## DUCH:	
I'll stop your mouth.

---

## ANT:	
Nay, that's but one; Venus had two soft doves To draw her chariot; I must have another.

---

## DUCH:	
Doth not the colour of my hair 'gin to change?

---


When I wax gray, I shall have all the court Powder their hair with arras to be like me.

---


You have cause to love me; I enter'd you into my heart Before you would vouchsafe to call for the keys.

---




We shall one day have my brothers take you napping: Methinks his presence, being now in court,


---

Should make you keep your own bed; 

---

but you'll say Love mixt with fear is sweetest.

---


Have you lost your tongue? 'Tis welcome:
For know, whether I am doom'd to live or die, 

---

I can do both like a prince.

---

## FERD:	
Die then quickly.

---




Virtue, where art thou hid? what hideous thing Is it that doth eclipse thee?

---

## DUCH:	
Pray, sir, hear me.

---

## FERD:	
Or is it true thou art but a bare name, And no essential thing?

---

## DUCH:	
Sir
---

## FERD:	
Do not speak.

---

## DUCH:	
No, sir:
I will plant my soul in mine ears, to hear you.

---

## FERD:	
O, most imperfect light of human reason, That mak'st us so unhappy to foresee


---

What we can least prevent! 

---

Pursue thy wishes, And glory in them: there's in shame no comfort, 

---

But to be past all bounds and sense of shame.

---

## DUCH:	
I pray, sir, hear me: I am married. 

---

## FERD:
So.

---

## DUCH:	
Happily, not to your liking: but for that, 

---



---

Alas, your shears do come untimely now


---



---

To clip the bird's wings, that's already flown! Will you see my spouse?

---

## FERD:	
Yes.

---


If I could change eyes with a basilisk.

---

## DUCH:	
Sure, you came hither
By their confederacy.

---

## FERD:	
The howling of a wolf
Is music to thee, screech-owl: prithee, peace. 

---

Whate'er thou art that hast enjoy'd my sister,


---

For I am sure thou hears't me, for thine own sake Let me not know thee. 

---

I come hither prepar'd
To work thy discovery; 

---

yet am now persuaded It would beget such violent effects


---

As would damn us both. I would not for ten millions 

---

I had beheld thee: therefore use all means
I never may have knowledge of thy name; 

---

Enjoy thy lust still, and a wretched life,


---

On that condition. And for thee, vile woman, It thou do love him, 

---

cut out thine own tongue Lest it betray him.

---

## DUCH:	
Why might not I marry?

---


I have not gone about in this to create Any new world or custom.

---

## FERD:	
Thou art undone;
And thou hast ta'en that massy sheet of lead 

---

That hid thy mate’s bones, and folded it About my heart.

---

## DUCH:	
Mine bleeds for't!

---

## FERD:	
Thine! thy heart!

---


What should I name't, unless a hollow bullet 

---

Fill'd with unquenchable wild-fire?

---

## DUCH:	
You are in this Too strict; and were you not my princely brother, 

---

I would say, too wilful: my reputation
Is safe.

---

## FERD:	
Dost thou know what reputation is?

---


I'll tell thee - to small purpose, since th' instruction Comes now too late.

---


Upon a time Reputation, Love, and Death


---

Would travel o'er the world; and it was concluded That they should part, 

---

and take three several ways. Death told them, they should find him in great battles,


---

Or cities plagu'd with plagues: 

---

Love gives them counsel To enquire for him 'mongst unambitious shepherds, 

---

Where dowries were not talk'd of, and sometimes 'Mongst quiet kindred, 

---

that had nothing left
By their dead parents: stay, quoth Reputation, 

---

Do not forsake me; for it is my nature


---

If once I part from any man I meet,
I am never found again. 

---

And so, for you; You have shook hands with Reputation, And made him invisible. 

---

So fare you well: I will never see you more.

---

## DUCH:	
You saw this apparition?

---

## ANT:	
Yes: we are betray'd.

---


I would this terrible thing would come again, That, standing on my guard, I might relate My warrantable love! Ha! what means this?

---

## DUCH:	
He left this with me.

---

## ANT:	
And it seems, did wish
You would use it on yourself.

---

## DUCH:	
His action
Seem'd to intend so much.

---

## ANT:	
This hath a handle to't,
As well as a point: turn it towards him,

---


And so fasten the keen edge in his rank gall.	

---

[A knock at the door]

---


How now! who knocks? more earthquakes!

---

## DUCH:	
I stand
As if a mine beneath my feet were ready To be blown up.

---

## ANT:	
'Tis Bosola. 

---

## DUCH:
Away.

---


O misery! methinks unjust actions
Should wear these masks and curtains, and not we.

---


You must instantly part hence: I have fashion'd it already.

---

## BOS:	
The duke your brother is ta'en up in a whirlwind; 

---

Hath took horse, and 's rid post to Rome.

---

## DUCH:	
So late!

---

## BOS:	
He told me, as he mounted into th' saddle, You were undone.

---

## DUCH:	
Indeed, I am very near it.

---

## BOS:	
What's the matter?

---

## DUCH:	
Antonio, the master of our household, Hath dealt so falsely with me in's accounts:


---

My brother stood engag’d with me for money And Antonio lets the bonds be forfeit.

---

## BOS:	
Strange!- this is cunning!

---

## DUCH:	
And hereupon
My brother's bills at Naples are protested Against. Call up our officers.

---

## BOS:	
I shall.

---

## DUCH:	
The place that you must fly to, is Ancona: Hire a house there; I'll send after you


---

My treasure, and my jewels. Our weak safety Runs upon engenius wheels: short syllables, 

---

Must stand for periods. I must now accuse you Of such a feigned crime,


---

'Cause it must shield our honours:- hark, she is coming!

---

## ANT:	
Will your grace hear me?

---

## DUCH:	
I have got well by you; you have yielded me A million of loss: I am like to inherit
The people's curses for your stewardship. 

---

You had the trick in audit-time to be sick,
Till I had sign'd your Quietus; 

---

and that cur'd you Without help of a doctor. Bosola,
I would have this drudge be an example to you all; 

---

But, because I intend to be rid of them,
I mean not to publish.—Use your fortune elsewhere.

---

## ANT:	
I am strongly arm'd to brook my overthrow: As commonly men bear with a hard year,


---

I will not blame the cause on't; but do think
The necessity of my malevolent star


---

Procures this, not her humour. 

---

O, the inconstant And rotten ground of service!

---

## DUCH:	
We do confiscate Towards the satisfying of your accounts, All that you have.

---

## ANT:	
I am all yours; and 'tis very fit All mine should be so.

---

## DUCH:	
So, Antonio, you have your pass. 

---

## ANT:
You may see, Bosola, what it is to serve
A prince with body and soul.

---

## BOS:	
Alas, poor soul!

---

## DUCH:	
Poor! Anotio hath amply fill'd their coffers. 

---

## BOS:
Sure they were too honest.

---


Let me shew you, what a most unvalued jewel You have in a wanton humour thrown away,


---

To bless the man shall find them. 

---

They were an excellent Courtier, and most faithful; a soldier, that thought it
As beastly to know one's own value too little, 

---

As devilish to acknowledge it too much.

---


Both their virtue and form deserv'd a far better fortune.

---


Their discourse rather delighted to judge itself, than shew itself: 

---

Their breast was fill'd with all perfection,
And yet it seemed a private whispering-room, It made so little noise of't.

---

## DUCH:	
But they were basely descended. 

---

## BOS:
Will you make yourself a mercenary herald,
Rather to examine pedigrees, than virtues? 

---

You shall want them.

---


Fare thee well, Antonio! since the malice of the world Would needs down with thee, 

---

it cannot be said yet That any ill happened unto thee, considering thy fall Was accompanied with virtue.

---

## DUCH:	
O, you render me excellent music! 

---

## BOS:
Say you?

---

## DUCH:	
This good one that you speak of, is my spouse.

---

## BOS:	
Do I not dream? can this ambitious age
Have so much goodness in't? Fortunate lady! 

---

For you have made your private nuptial bed The humble and fair seminary of peace.

---

## DUCH:	
As I taste comfort in this friendly speech, So would I find concealment.

---

## BOS:	
O, the secret of my prince,
Which I will wear on th' inside of my heart!

---

## DUCH:	
You shall take charge of all my coin and jewels, And follow them; for Antonio retires
To Ancona.

---

## BOS:	
So.

---

## DUCH:	
Whither, within few days, I mean to follow thee.

---

## BOS:	
Let me think:
I would wish your grace to feign a pilgrimage To our lady of Loretto, scare seven leagues From fair Ancona; 

---

so may you depart
Your country with more honour, and your flight Will seem a princely progress, 

---

retaining
Your usual train about you.

---

## DUCH:	
Madam, your direction
Shall lead me by the hand.

---


Prepare us instantly for our departure.

---


Past sorrows, let us moderately lament them, For those to come, seek wisely to prevent them.

---

## BOS:	
A politician is the devil's quilted anvil;


---

He fashions all sins on him, and the blows
Are never heard: he may work in a lady's chamber, As here for proof. 

---

What rests but I reveal
All to my lord? O, this base quality
Of intelligencer! 

---

why, every quality i'th' world Prefers but gain or commendation.

---


Now, for this act I am certain to be rais'd,
And men that paint weeds to the life, are prais'd.

---

## CARD:	
Doth she make religion her ridinghood To keep her from the sun and tempest?

---

## FERD:	
That, that damns her.

---


Methinks her fault and beauty, Blended together, shew like leprosy, The whiter, the fouler.

---

## CARD:	
I will instantly solicit the state of Ancona To have them banish'd.

---

## FERD:	
Fare you well.	Antonio!


---


A druge that only smell'd of ink and counters, 

---

And never in 's life look'd like a gentleman, But in the audit-time. 

---

Go, go presently,
Draw me out an hundred and fifty of our horse, And meet me at the foot-bridge.

---

---

## DUCH:	
Banish'd Ancona!

---

## ANT:	
Yes, you see what power Lightens in great men's breath.

---

## DUCH:	
I had a very strange dream to night. 

---

## ANT:
What was't?

---

## DUCH:	
Methought I wore my coronet of state, And on a sudden all the diamonds Were chang'd to pearls.

---

## ANT:	
My interpretation
Is, you'll weep shortly; for to me the pearls Do signify your tears.

---

## DUCH:	
The birds that live i'th' field
On the wild benefit of nature, 

---

live
Happier than we; for they may choose their mates, 

---

And carol their sweet pleasures to the spring.

---

## BOS:	
You are happily o'erta'en. 

---

## DUCH:
From my brother?

---

## BOS:	
Yes, from the Lord Ferinand, your brother, All love and safety.

---

## DUCH:	
Thou dost blanch mischief,
Would'st make it white.

---


See, see, like to calm weather
At sea before a tempest, 

---

false hearts speak fair
To those they intend most mischief. 


---

Send Antonio to me; I want her head in a business.

---


A politic equivocation!

---


He doth not want your counsel, but your head; That is, he cannot sleep till you be dead.

---


And here's another pitfall that's strew'd o'er With roses; mark it, 'tis a cunning one;


---

I stand engaged for your mate, for several debts at Naples: let not that trouble her; 

---

I had rather have her heart than her money:
And I believe so too.

---

## BOS:	
What do you believe?

---

## DUCH:	
That he so much distrusts my consort’s love,
He will by no means believe their heart is with them, 

---

Until he see it: the devil is not cunning enough
To circumvent us in riddles.

---

## BOS:	
Will you reject that noble and free league Of amity and love, which I present you?

---

## DUCH:	
His league is like that of some politic kings, 

---

Only to make themselves of strength and power To be our after-ruin: tell him so.

---

## BOS:	
And what from you?

---

## ANT:	
Thus tell him; I will not come. 

---

## BOS:
And what of this?

---

## ANT:	
My brothers have dispers'd Blood-hounds abroad; which till I hear are muzzled, 

---

No truce, though hatch'd with ne'er such politic skill, Is safe, that hangs upon our enemies' will.

---


I'll not come at them.

---

## BOS:	
Fare you well, both:
You shall shortly hear from's.

---

## DUCH:	
I suspect some ambush:
Therefore by all my love I do conjure you fly towards Milan.

---


Let us not venture all this poor remainder, In one unlucky bottom.

---

## ANT:	
You counsel safely.

---


Best of my life, farewell, since we must part: 

---

Heaven hath a hand in't: but no otherwise, Than as some curious artist takes in sunder A clock, or watch, when it is out of frame, 

---

To bring't in better order.

---

## DUCH:	
I know not which is best,
To see you dead, or part with you.

---

## ANT:	
O, be of comfort!

---


Make patience a noble fortitude,


---

And think not how unkindly we are us'd:


---

Man, like to cassia, is prov'd best, being bruis'd.

---

## DUCH:	
Must I, like to a slav-born Russian, Account it praise to suffer tyranny?

---


And yet, O heaven, thy heavy hand is in't!

---

## ANT:	
Heaven fashion'd us out of nothing; and we strive To bring ourselves to nothing. Fare you well.

---

## DUCH:	
Let me look upon you once more: your kiss is colder Than that I have seen a holy anchorite
Give to a dead man's skull.

---

## ANT:	
My heart is turn'd to a heavy lump of lead, With which I sound my danger: fare you well.

---

## DUCH:	
My laurel is all wither'd.

---

## DUCH:	
O, you are very welcome!

---


I would have my ruin
Be sudden. I am your adventure, am I not?

---

## BOS:	
You are: you must see your companion no more.

---

## DUCH:	
What devil art thou, that counterfeits heaven's thunder?

---

## BOS:	
Is that terrible? I would have you tell me
Whether is that note worse that frights the silly birds Out of the corn, 

---

or that which doth allure them
To the nets? you have hearken'd to the last too much.

---

## DUCH:	
O misery! like to a rusty o'er-charg'd cannon.

---


Shall I ne'er fly in pieces? Come, to what prison?

---

## BOS:	
To none.

---

## DUCH:	
Whither, then?

---

## BOS:	
To your palace.

---

## DUCH:	
I have heard that Charon's boat serves to convey All o'er the dismal lake, but brings none back again.

---

## BOS:	
Your brothers mean you safety and pity. 

---

## DUCH:
Pity!

---

## BOS:	
Fie, madam,
Forget this base, low steward -

---

## DUCH:	
Were I my brothers, I 'd beat that counterfeit face into thy other.

---

## BOS:	
—One of no birth.

---

## DUCH:	
I prithee, who is greatest? Can you tell? Sad tales befit my woe: I'll tell you one. 

---

A salmon, as she swam unto the sea, Met with a dog-fish, who encounters her


---

With this rough language: Why art thou so bold To mix thyself with our high state of floods, 

---

Being no eminent courtier, but one
That for the calmest, and fresh time o'th' year Dost live in shallow rivers, 

---

rank'st thyself
With silly smelts and shrimps? and darest thou Pass by our dog-ship without reverence?

---


O, quoth the salmon, sister, be at peace: Thank Jupiter, we both have past the net! 

---

Our value never can be truly known,
Till in the fisher's basket we be shown:
I' th' market then my price may be the higher, 

---

Even when I am nearest to the cook and fire. So, to great men the moral may be stretched;


---

Men oft are valu'd high, when th' are most wretched.

---


But come, whither you please. I am arm'd 'gainst misery; Bent to all sways of the oppressor's will:
There's no deep valley but near some great hill.

---


## FERD:	
How doth our sister duchess bear herself In her imprisonment?

---

## BOS:	
Nobly:
She's sad, as one long us'd to't, and she seems Rather to welcome the end of misery,


---

Than shun it; a behaviour so noble, 

---

As gives a majesty to adversity:
She will muse for hours together; and her silence, 

---

Methinks, expresseth more than if she spake.

---

## FERD:	
Her melancholy seems to be fortified With a strange disdain.

---

## BOS:	
'Tis so; and this restraint,
Like English mastiffs that grow fierce with tying, 

---

Makes her too passionately apprehend
Those pleasure's she's kept from.

---

## FERD:	
Curse upon her!

---


I will no longer study in the book
Of another's heart. Inform her what I told you.

---

## BOS:	
All comfort to your grace.

---

## DUCH:	
I will have none.

---


Pray thee, why dost thou wrap thy poison'd pills In gold and sugar?

---

## BOS:	
Your elder brother, the Lord Ferdinand, Is come to visit you, and sends you word,


---

'Cause once he rashly made a solemn vow Never to see you more, he comes i'th' night; 

---

And prays you gently neither torch nor taper Shine in your chamber: he will kiss your hand, And reconcile himself; 

---

but, for his vow,
He dares not see you.

---

## DUCH:	
At his pleasure.

---


Take hence the lights; he's come.

---

## FERD:	
Where are you?

---

## DUCH:	
Here, sir.

---

## FERD:	
This darkness suits you well. 

---

## DUCH:
I would ask you pardon.

---

## FERD:	
You have it;
For I account it the honorabl'st revenge, Where I may kill, to pardon.

---

## DUCH:	
Do you visit me for this?

---


You violate a sacrament o'th' church Shall make you howl in hell for't.

---

## FERD:	
It had been well,
Could you have liv'd thus always; 

---

for indeed, You were too much i'th' light- but no more;


---

I come to seal my peace with you. Here's a hand,



---

To which you have vow'd much love; the ring upon't You gave.

---

## DUCH:	
I affectionately kiss it.

---

## FERD:	
Pray do, and bury the print of it in your heart. 

---

## DUCH:
You are very cold:
I fear you are not well after your travel. 

---

Ha! lights! O, horrible!

---

## FERD:	
Let her have lights enough.

---

## DUCH:	
What witchcraft doth he practise, that he hath left A dead man's hand here?

---

## BOS:	
Look you, here's the piece, from which 'twas ta'en.

---


He doth present you this sad spectacle, 

---

That, now you know directly they are dead, 

---

Hereafter you may wisely cease to grieve For that which cannot be recovered.

---

## DUCH:	
There is not between heaven and earth one wish I stay for after this.

---

## BOS:	
Come, you must live.

---

## DUCH:	
That's the greatest torture souls feel in hell, In hell that they must live, and cannot die. 

---

Portia, I'll new kindle thy coals again,


---

And revive the rare and almost dead example Of a loving wife.

---

## BOS:	
O fie! despair? remember You are a Christian.

---

## DUCH:	
The church enjoins fasting: I'll starve myself to death.

---

## BOS:	
Leave this vain sorrow.

---


Things being at the worst, begin to mend.

---

## DUCH:	
Good comfortable madam!

---


Persuade a wretch that's broke upon the wheel To have all his bones new set; entreat him live To be executed again. 

---

Who must dispatch me? 

---

I account this world a tedious theatre,
For I do play a part in't 'gainst my will.

---

## BOS:	
Come, be of comfort; I will save your life.

---

## DUCH:	
Indeed I have not leisure to tend so small a business. 

---

## BOS:
Now, by my life, I pity you.

---

## DUCH:	
Thou art a fool then,
To waste thy pity on a thing so wretched As cannot pity itself. 

---

I am full of daggers. Puff, let me blow those vipers from me.

---


I'll go pray, no, I'll go curse.

---

## BOS:	
O, fie!

---

## DUCH:	
I could curse the stars.

---

## BOS:	
O, fearful!

---

## DUCH:	
And those three smiling seasons of the year Into a Russian winter: nay the world
To its first chaos.

---

## BOS:	
Look you, the stars shine still. 

---

## DUCH:
O, but you must remember,
My curse hath a great way to go:-


---

Plagues, that make lanes through largest families, Consume them!

---

## BOS:	
Fie, lady.

---

## DUCH:	
Let them like tyrants
Never be remember'd, but for the ill they have done; 

---

Let all the zealous prayers of mortified
Churchmen forget them!

---

## BOS:	
O, uncharitable!

---

## DUCH:	
Let heaven, a little while, cease crowning martyrs,
To punish them! 

---

Go, howl them this, and say, I long to bleed: It is some mercy when men kill with speed.

---

## FERD:	
Excellent, as I would wish; she's plagu'd in art: 

---

These presentations are but fram'd in wax,
and she takes them for true substantial bodies.

---

## BOS:	
Why do you do this?

---

## FERD:	
To bring her to despair.

---

## BOS:	
'Faith, end here,
And go no farther in your cruelty;


---

Send her a penitential garment to put on Next to her delicate skin, and furnish her With beads, and prayer-books.

---

## FERD:	
Damn her! that body of hers,
While that my blood ran pure in't, was more worth Than that which thou wouldlst comfort, called a soul. 

---

Your work is almost ended.

---

## BOS:	
Must I see her again?

---

## FERD:	
Yes.

---

## BOS:	
Never.

---

## FERD:	
You must.

---

## BOS:	
Never in mine own shape; That's forfeited by my intelligence,


---

And this last cruel lie: when you send me next,


---

The business shall be comfort.

---

## FERD:	
Very likely; Thy pity is nothing of kin to thee. 

---

Antonio
Lurks about Milan: thou shalt shortly thither, 

---

To feed a fire as great as my revenge,
Which never will slack till it have spent her fuel: 

---

Intemperate agues make physicians cruel.

---

## DUCH:	
O, that it were possible I might
But hold some two days' conference with the dead! 

---

From them O should learn somewhat, I am sure,
I never shall know here. 

---

I'll say tis a miracle; I am not mad yet, to my cause of sorrow:
Th' heaven o'er my head seems made of molten brass, 

---

The earth of flaming sulphur, yet I am not mad.

---


I am acquainted with sad misery; Necessity makes me suffer constantly, And custom makes it easy.

---

## BOS:	
I am come to make thy tomb.

---

## DUCH:	
Ha! my tomb!

---


Thou speak'st, as if I lay upon my death-bed, 

---

Gasping for breath: dost thou perceive me sick?

---

## BOS:	
Yes, and the more dangerously, since thy sickness Is insensible.

---

## DUCH:	
Thou art not mad sure: dost thou know me? 

---

## BOS:
Yes.

---

## DUCH:	
Who am I?

---

## BOS:	
Thou art a box of worm-seed, at best but a salvatory of green mummy. 

---

What's this flesh? a little cruded milk Fantastical puff-paste. 

---

Our bodies are weaker than those Paper-prisons boys use to keep flies in; more contemptible, Since ours is to preserve earth-worms. 

---

Didst thou ever see A lark in a cage? such is the soul in the body: this world
Is like her little turf of grass, and the heaven o'er our heads, 

---

Like her looking-glass, only gives us a miserable knowledge Of the small compass of our prison.

---

## DUCH:	
I am Duchess of Malfi still. 

---

## BOS:
That makes thy sleep so broken:


---

Glories, like glowworms afar off shine bright,


---

But look'd to near, have neither heat nor light.

---

## DUCH:	
Thou art very plain.

---

## BOS:	
My trade is to flatter the dead, not the living; I am a tomb-maker.

---

## DUCH:	
And thou com'st to make my tomb? 

---

## BOS:
Yes.

---

## DUCH:	
Let me be a little merry:
Of what stuff wilt thou make it?

---

## BOS:	
Nay, resolve me first, of what fashion?

---

## DUCH:	
Why, do we grow fantastical in our death-bed?

---


Do we affect fashion in the grave?

---

## BOS:	
Most ambitiously. Princes' images on their tombs Do not lie, as they were wont, seeming to pray
Up to heaven; 

---

but with their hands under their cheeks, As if they died of the tooth-ache: 

---

they are not carved With their eyes fixt upon the stars; but


---

As their minds were wholly bent upon the world, The selfsame way they seem to turn their faces.

---

## DUCH:	
Let me know fully, therefore, the effect Of this thy dismal preparation,


---

This talk, fit for a charnel.

---

## BOS:	
Now I shall:


Here is a present from your princely brothers, And may it arrive welcome, for it brings
Last benefit, last sorrow.

---

## DUCH:	
Let me see it:
I have so much obedience in my blood, I wish it in their veins to do them good.

---

## BOS:	
This is your last presence-chamber. 

---

## DUCH:
It affrights not me.

---


What death?

---

## BOS:	
Strangling; here is your executioner.	

---

## DUCH:	
I forgive them:


---

The apoplexy, catarrh, or cough o'th' lungs, Would do as much as they do.

---

## BOS:	
Doth not death fright you?

---

## DUCH:	
Who would be afraid on't,
Knowing to meet such excellent company In th' other world?

---

## BOS:	
Yet, methinks,
The manner of your death should much afflict you; This cord should terrify you.

---

## DUCH:	
Not a whit:


---

What would it pleasure me to have my throat cut With diamonds? or to be smothered
With cassia? or to be shot to death with pearls? 

---

I know death hath ten thousand several doors For men to take their exits; and 'tis found


---

They go on such strange geometrical hinges,


---

You may open them both ways: any way, for heaven sake, So I were out of your whispering. 

---

Tell my brothers,
That I perceive death, now I am well awake, 

---

Best gift is they can give, or I can take.

---


I'd not be tedious to you.

---

## DUCH:	
Pull, and pull strongly, for your able strength, Must pull down heaven upon me:


---

Yet stay, heaven-gates are not so highly arch'd As princes' palaces; 

---

they that enter there,
Must go upon their knees. 

---

Come, violent death, Serve for mandragora, to make me sleep:


---

Go, tell my brothers, when I am laid out, They then may feed in quiet.

---

## FERD:	
Is she dead?

---

## BOS:	
She is what
You'd have her. But here begin your pity: Fix your eye here.

---

## FERD:	
Constantly.

---

## BOS:	
Do you not weep?

---


Other sins only speak; murder shrieks out: 

---

The element of water moistens the earth,
But blood flies upwards and bedews the heavens. 

---

## FERD:
Cover her face; mine eyes dazzle: she died young.

---

## BOS:	
I think not so; her infelicity Seem'd to have years too many.

---

## FERD:	
She and I were twins;
And should I die this instant, I had liv'd Her time to a minute.

---

## BOS:	
It seems she was born first: You have bloodily approv'd the ancient truth, 

---

That kindred commonly do worse agree
Than remote strangers.

---

## FERD:	
Let me see her face again. Why didst not thou pity her? what an excellent Honest steward might'st thou have been
If thou hadst born her to some sanctuary;


---

I had thee, when I was distracted of my wits, Go kill my dearest friend, and thou hast done't. For let me but examine well the cause:


---

What was the meanness of her match to me?

---



And that was the main cause, her marriage,
That drew a stream of gall quite through my heart. 

---

For thee, as we observe in tragedies
That a good actor many times is curs'd


---

For playing a villain's part, I hate thee for't,
And for my sake say thou hast done much ill, well.

---

## BOS:	
Let me quicken your memory, for I perceive You are falling into ingratitude; I challenge The reward due to my service.

---

## FERD:	
I'll tell thee
What I'll give thee.

---

## BOS:	
Do.

---

## FERD:	
I'll give thee a pardon for this murder.

---

## BOS:	
Ha!

---

## FERD:	
Yes, and 'tis The largest bounty I can study to do thee.

---


By what authority didst thou execute This bloody sentence?

---

## BOS:	
By yours.

---

## FERD:	
Mine! Was I her judge?

---


Did any ceremonial form of law,
Doom her to not being? did a complete jury
deliver her conviction up i'th' court?

---


Where shalt thou find this judgment register'd, Unless in hell? see, like a bloody fool,
Th' hast forfeited thy life, and thou shalt die for't.

---

## BOS:	
The office of justice is perverted quite,
When one thief hangs another. Who shall dare To reveal this?

---

## FERD:	
O, I'll tell thee;
The wolf shall find her grave, and scrape it up, Not to devour the corpse, but to discover
The horrid murder.

---

## BOS:	
You, not I, shall quake for't. 

---

## FERD:
Leave me.

---

## BOS:	
I will first receive my pension.

---

## FERD:	
You are a villain.

---

## BOS:	
When your ingratitude Is judge, I am so.

---

## FERD:	
O horror,
Never look upon me more.

---

## BOS:	
Why, fare thee well:
Your brother and yourself are worthy men: You have a pair of hearts are hollow graves,
Rotten, and rotting others; and your vengeance, 

---

Like two chain'd bullets, still goes arm in arm. You may be brothers; for treason, like the plague, Doth take much in a blood. 

---

I stand like one
That long hath ta'en a sweet and golden dream: I am angry with myself, now that I wake.

---

## FERD:	
Get thee into some unknown part o'th' world, That I may never see thee.

---

## BOS:	
Let me know
Wherefore I should be thus neglected? 

---

Sir,
I serv'd your tyranny, and rather strove, To satisfy yourself, than all the world:


---

And though I loath'd the evil, yet I lov'd You that did counsel it; 

---

and rather sought
To appear a true servant, than an honest woman.

---

## FERD:	
I'll go hunt the badger by owl-light: 'Tis a deed of darkness.

---

## BOS:	
He's much distracted. Off, my painted honour!

---


While with vain hopes our faculties we tire, We seem to sweat in ice and freeze in fire. What would I do, were this to do again?

---


I would not change my peace of conscience For all the wealth of Europe.


---

These tears, I am very certain, never grew In my mother's milk: my estate is sunk Below the degree of fear: 

---

where were
These penitent fountains, while she was living? O, they were frozen up! 

---

Here is a sight
As direful to my soul, as is the sword Unto a wretch hath slain his father. 

---

Come, I'll bear thee hence; that, the cruel tyrant
Shall not deny me. 

---

Then I'll post to Milan, Where somewhat I will speedily enact Worth my dejection. Antonio.	What think you of my hope of reconcilement To the Arragonian brethren?

---

## DELIA:	
I misdoubt it;
For though they have sent letter of safe conduct For your repair to Milan, 

---

they appear
But nets to entrap you.

---


I cannot think they mean well to your life That do deprive you of your means of life, Your living.

---

## ANT:	
You are still an heretic To any safety I can shape myself.

---

## DELIA:	
Prince Ferdinand 's come to Milan, Sick, as they give out, of an apoplexy; But some say 'tis a frenzy.

---


What course do you mean to take, Antonio?

---

## ANT:	
This night I mean to venture all my fortune, Which is no more than a poor lingering life, To the cardinal's worst of malice: 

---

I have got Private access to his chamber; and intend To visit him about the mid of night,
As once his brother did our noble duchess. 

---

It may be that the sudden apprehension
Of danger, for I'll go in mine own shape, 

---

When he shall see it fright with love and duty, May draw the poison out of him, and work
A friendly reconcilement: 

---

if it fail,
Yet it shall rid me of this infamous calling;


---

For better fall once, than be ever falling.

---

## DELIA:	
I'll second you in all danger, and, howe'er; My life keeps rank with yours.

---

## ANT:	
You are still my lov'd and best friend.

---

## CARD:	
Now, doctor, may I visit your patient?

---


Pray thee, what's his disease?

---


## DOC:	
A very pestilent disease, my lord, They call lycanthropia.

---

## CARD:	
What's that?

---


I need a dictionary to't?

---



## DOC:	
I'll tell you.

---


In those that are possess'd with't there o'erflows Such melancholy humour, they imagine Themselves to be transformed into wolves; 

---

Steal forth to church-yards in the dead of night, And dig dead bodies up: as two nights since One met the duke 'bout midnight in a lane Behind St. Mark's Church, 

---

with the leg of a man Upon his shoulder, and he howl'd fearfully;


---

Said he was a wolf, only the difference Was, a wolf's skin was hairy on the outside,
His on the inside; 

---

bade them take their swords, Rip up his flesh, and try: straight, I was sent for, 

---

And having minister'd unto him, found his grace Very well recover'd.

---

## CARD:	
I am glad on't.

---


Doc. Yet not without some fear
Of a relapse. If he grow to his fit again, 

---

I'll buffet his madness out of him.

---


Stand aside; he comes.

---

## FERD:	
Leave me.

---

## DUCH:
Why doth your lordship love this solitariness? 

---

## FERD:
Eagles commonly fly alone: they are crows,
Daws, and starlings that flock together. 

---

Look, What's that follows me?

---

## DOCTOR:	
Nothing, my lord. 

---

## FERD:
Yes.

---

## DUCH:	
'Tis your shadow.

---

## FERD:	
Stay it; let it not haunt me.

---

## DUCH:	
Impossible, if you move, and the sun shine. 

---

## FERD:
I will throttle it.

---

## DOCTOR:	
O, my lord, you are angry with nothing.

---

## FERD:	
You are a fool:
How is't possible I should catch my shadow, Unless I fall upon't? 

---

When I go to hell,
I mean to carry a bribe; for, look you,


---

Good gifts evermore make way for the worst persons.

---

## BOS:	
Rise, good my lord.

---

## FERD:	
I am studying the art of patience.

---

## CARD:	
'Tis a noble virtue.

---

## FERD:	
To drive six snails before me from this town
To Moscow; 

---

neither use goad nor whip to them,
But let them take their own time;- 

---

(the patient'st man i'th' world Match me for an experiment)- 

---

and I'll crawl
After like a sheep-biter.

---

## CARD:	
Force him up.

---

## FERD:	
Use me well, you were best.

---


What I have done, I have done: I'll confess nothing.

---



## DOC:	
Now let me come to him.- Are you mad, my lord?

---


Are you out of your princely wits?

---

## FERD:	
What's he?

---

## BOS:	
Your doctor. 

---

## DOC:	
Now he begins to fear me.

---


I find by his eye he stands in awe of me; I'll make him as tame as a dormouse.

---

## FERD:	
I will stamp him into a cullis,
Flay off his skin, 

---

to cover one of the anatomies This rogue hath set i'th' cold yonder
In Barber-Chirugeon's-hall.

---


Hence, hence! you are all of you like beasts for sacrifice: There's nothing left of you, but tongue and belly, Flattery and lechery.

---

## CARD:	
Doctor, he did not fear you thoroughly. Doc.	True; I was somewhat too forward.

---

## BOS:	
Mercy upon me, what a fatal judgment
Hath fall'n upon this Ferdinand! 

---

Knows your grace What accident hath brought unto the prince
This strange distraction?

---

## CARD:	
Thus they say it grew.

---


You have heard it rumour'd for these many years, 

---

None of our family dies but there is seen
The shape of an old woman, which is given


---

By tradition to us to have been murder'd
By her nephews, for her riches. 

---

Such a figure One night, as the prince sat up late at's book, Appear'd to him; when, crying out for help, The gentleman of's chamber, 

---

found his grace All on a cold sweat, alter'd much in face
And language: since which apparition,


---

He hath grown worse and worse, and I much fear He cannot live.

---

## BOS:	
Sir, I would speak with you. 

---

## DOC:	
We 'll leave your grace.

---

## CARD:	
This fellow must not know
By any means I had intelligence
In our duchess' death; for though I counsell'd it, 

---

The full of all th' engagement seem'd to grow
From Ferdinand. 

---

Now, Ma’am, how fares our sister? 

---

I do not think but sorrow makes her look
Like to an oft-dy'd garment: she shall now
Taste comfort from me. 

---

Why do you look so wildly? 

---

O, the fortune of your master here, the prince, Dejects you; but be you of happy comfort:


---

If you'll do one thing for me, I'll entreat, Though he had a cold tombstone o'er his bones, I'd make you what you would be.

---

## BOS:	
Anything,
Give it me in a breath, and fly to't:


---

They that think long, small expedition win, For musing much o'th' end, cannot begin.

---

## JULIA:	
Sir, will you come in to supper?

---

## CARD:	
I am busy; leave me.

---

## JULIA:	
What an excellent shape hath that lady!

---

## CARD:	
'Tis thus. Antonio lurks here in Milan: Enquire him out, and kill him. 

---

While he lives, Our sister cannot marry, and I have thought
Of an excellent match for her. 

---

Do this, and style me Thy advancement.

---

## BOS:	
But by what means shall I find him out? 

---

## CARD:
There is a gentlewoman call'd Delia,
Here in the camp, that hath been long approv'd
Her loyal friend. Set eye upon that lady; There are a thousand ways
A man might find to trace her.

---

## BOS:	
Well, I'll not freeze i'th' business:
I would see that wretched thing, Antonio, Above all sights i'th' world.

---

## CARD:	
Do, and be happy.

---

## BOS:	
This fellow doth breed basilisks in's eyes, He's nothing else but murder; yet he seems Not to have notice of the duchess' death. 'Tis his cunning: I must follow his example; There cannot be a surer way to trace
Than that of an old fox.

---

## JULIA:	
So, you are well met.

---

## BOS:	
How now?

---

## JULIA:	
Nay, the doors are fast enough:
Now, there, I will make you confess your treachery.

---

## BOS:	
Treachery!

---

## JULIA:	
Yes, confess to me
Which of my women 'twas you hired to put Love-powder into my drink?

---

## BOS:	
Love-powder!

---

## JULIA:	
Yes, when I was at Malfi.

---


Why should I fall in love with such a face else? I have already suffer'd for thee so much pain, The only remedy to do me good,
Is to kill my longing.

---

## BOS:	
Sure your pistol holds
Nothing but perfumes, or kissing-comforts. Excellent lady! You have a pretty way on't to discover
Your longing. Come, come, I'll disarm you, And arm you thus: yet this is wondrous strange.

---

## JULIA:	
Compare thy form and my eyes together, You'll find my love no such great miracle. Now you'll say I am wanton: this nice modesty In ladies is but a troublesome familiar
That haunts them.

---

## BOS:	
Know you me, I am a blunt soldier.

---

## JULIA:	
The better;
Sure, there wants fire, where there are no lively sparks Of roughness.

---

## BOS:	
And I want compliment.

---

## JULIA:	
Why, ignorance n courtship cannot make you do amiss, If you have a heart to do well.

---

## BOS:	
You are very fair.

---

## JULIA:	
Nay, if you lay beauty to my charge, I must plead unguilty.

---

## BOS:	
Your bright eyes Carry a quiver of darts in them, sharper Than sun-beams.

---

## JULIA:	
You will mar me with commendation, Put yourself to the chard of courting me, Whereas now I woo you.

---

## BOS:	
Let us grow most amorously familiar: If the great cardinal should see me thus, Would he not count me a villain?

---

## JULIA:	
No, he might count me a wanton, Not lay a scruple of offence on you; 

---

For if I see, and steal a diamond,
The fault is not i'th' stone, but in me the thief That purloins it. 

---

I am sudden with you:
We that are great women of pleasure, use to cut off These uncertain wishes and unquiet longings,


---

And in an instant join the sweet delight
And the pretty excuse together. 

---

Had you been i'th' street, Under my chamber window, even there
I should have courted you.

---

## BOS:	
O, you are an excellent lady!

---

## DELIA:	
Yond's the cardinal's window. This fortification Grew from the ruins of an ancient abbey;


---

And to yond' side o'th' river lies a wall, Piece of a cloister, 

---

which in my opinion Gives the best echo that you ever heard, 

---

So hollow and so dismal, and withal
So plain in the distinction of our words, 

---

That many have suppos'd it is a spirit That answers.

---

## ANT:	
I do love these ancient ruins.

---


We never tread upon them, but we set Our foot upon some reverend history:


---

And, questionless, here in this open court, 

---

Which now lies naked to the injuries
Of stormy weather, some men lie interr'd
Lov'd the church so well, 

---

and gave so largely to't, They thought it should have canopied their bones Till doom's-day; but all things have their end:


---

Churches and cities, which have diseases like to men, Must have like death that we have.

---

## ECHO:
(from the Duchess' grave)  Like death that we have. Delia.	Now the echo hath caught you.

---

## ANT:	
It groan'd, methought, and gave A very deadly accent.

---

## ECHO:	
Deadly accent.

---

## DELIA:	
I told you 'twas a pretty one: you may make it A huntsman, or a falconer, a musician,
Or a thing of sorrow.

---

## ECHO:	
A thing of sorrow.

---

## ANT:	
Ay sure, that suits it best. Echo.	That suits it best.

---

## ANT:	
'Tis very like my wife's voice. Echo.	Ay, wife's voice.

---

## DELIA:	
Come, let us walk farther from't.

---


I would not have you go to th' cardinal's to-night: Do not.

---

## ECHO:	
Do not.

---

## DELIA:	
Wisdom doth not more moderate wasting sorrow Than time: take time for't: be mindful of thy safety.

---

## ECHO:	
Be mindful of thy safety.

---

## ANT:	
Necessity compels me:
Make scrutiny throughout the passes
Of your own life, you'll find it impossible To fly your fate.

---

## ECHO:	
O fly your fate!

---

## DELIA:	
Hark! the dead stones seem to have pity on you, And give you good counsel.

---

## ANT:	
Echo, I will not talk with thee, For thou art a dead thing.

---

## ECHO:	
Thou art a dead thing.

---

## ANT:	
My duchess is a-sleep now, O heaven,
Shall I never see her more?

---

## ECHO:	
Never see her more.

---

## ANT:	
I mark'd not one repetition of the echo But that; and on the sudden, a clear light Presented me a face folded in sorrow.

---

## DELIA:	
Your fancy merely.

---

## ANT:	
Come, I'll be out of this ague,
For to live thus, is not indeed to live; It is a mockery and abuse of life:
I will not henceforth save myself by halves; Lose all, or nothing.

---

## DELIA:	
Your own virtue save you!

---


However, fare you well.

---


Though in our miseries fortune have a part, Yet in our noble sufferings she hath none; 



---

## JULIA:	
Bid me do somewhat for you presently, To express I love you.

---

## BOS:	
I will, and if you love me,
Fail not to effect it. The Cardinal is grown wondrous melancholy: Demand the cause, let him not put you off
With feign'd excuse; discover the main ground on't.

---

## JULIA:	
Why would you know this?

---

## BOS:	
I have depende on him,
And I hear that he is fall'n in some disgrace With the emperor; 

---

if he be, like the mice That forsake falling houses, 

---

I would shift To other dependance. Will you do this?

---

## JULIA:	
Cunningly.

---

## BOS:	
To-morrow, I'll expect th'intelligence. 

---

## JULIA:
To-morrow? Get you into my cabinet;
You shall have it with you. 

---

Do not delay me, No more than I do you: I am like one
That is condemn'd; 

---

I have my pardon promis'd, But I would see it seal'd. Go, get you in:
You shall see me wind my tongue about his heart, 

---

Like a skein of silk.

---

## JULIA:	
How now, my lord, what ails you? 

---

## CARD:
Nothing.

---

## JULIA:	
O, you are much alter'd!

---


Come, I must be your secretary, and remove
This lead from off your bosom: what's the matter?

---

## CARD:	
I may not tell you.

---

## JULIA:	
Are you so far in love with sorrow, You cannot part with part of it? 

---

or think you
I cannot love your grace when you are sad As well as merry? 

---

or do you suspect
I, that have been a secret to your heart These many winters, 

---

cannot be the same Unto your tongue?

---

## CARD:	
Satisfy thy longing:
The only wal to make thee keep my counsel Is, not to tell thee.

---

## JULIA:	
Tell your echo this,
Or flatterers, that like echoes still report
What they hear though most imperfect, and not me; 

---

For, if that you be true unto yourself,
I'll know.

---

## CARD:	
Will you rack me?

---

## JULIA:	
No, judgment shall
Draw it from you: it is an equal fault, To tell one's secrets unto all or none.

---

## CARD:	
The first argues folly.

---

## JULIA:	
But the last tyranny.

---

## CARD:	
Very well; why, imagine I have committed Some secret deed, which I desire the world May not hear of.

---

## JULIA:	
Therefore may not I know it?

---


You have conceald'd for me as great a sin As adultery. Sir, never was occasion
For perfect trial of my constancy Till now: sir, I beseech you

---

## CARD:	
You'll repent it. 

---

## JULIA:
Never.

---

## CARD:	
It hurries thee to ruin: I'll not tell thee. 

---

## JULIA:
Now you dally with me.

---

## CARD:	
No more, thou shalt know it. By my appointment, the great Duchess of Malfi, four nights since, was strangl'd.

---

## JULIA:	
O heaven! sir, what have you done? 

---

## CARD:
How now! how settles this? think you
Your bosom will be a grave dark and obscure enough
For such a secret?

---

## JULIA:	
You have undone yourself, sir. 

---

## CARD:
Why?

---

## JULIA:	
It lies not in me to conceal it.

---

## CARD:	
No? Come, I will swear you to't upon this book. 

---

## JULIA:
Most religiously.

---

## CARD:	
Kiss it.

---


Now you shall never utter it; thy curiosity
Hath undone thee: 

---

thou art poison'd with that book; Because I knew thou couldst not keep my counsel, I have bound thee to't by death.

---

## BOS:	
For pity sake, hold.

---

## CARD:	
Ha, Bosola!

---

## JULIA:	
I forgive you
This equal piece of justice you have done; 

---

For I betray'd your counsel to Bosola:
She overheard it; that was the cause I said It lay not in me to conceal it.

---

## BOS:	
O, foolish woman,
Couldst not thou have posison'd him?

---

## JULIA:	
'Tis weakness,
Too much to think what should have been done. I go, I know not whither.

---

## CARD:	
Wherefore com'st thou hither?

---

## BOS:	
That I might find a great man, like yourself, Not out of his wits, as the Lord Ferdinand, To remember my service.

---

## CARD:	
I'll have thee hew'd in pieces. 

---

## BOS:
Make not yourself such a promise of that life,
Which is not yours to dispose of.

---

## CARD:	
Who plac'd thee here?

---

## BOS:	
Her lust, as she intended. 

---

## CARD:
Very well: now you know me
For your fellow-murderer.

---

## BOS:	
And wherefore should you lay your fair marble colours Upon your rotten purposes to me?

---


Unless you imitate some that do plot great treasons,


---

And when they have done, go hide themselves i'th' graves Of those were actors in't?

---

## CARD:	
No more;
There is a fortune attends thee.

---

## BOS:	
Shall I go sue to fortune any longer? 'Tis the fool's pilgrimage.

---

## CARD:	
I have honours in store for thee.

---

## BOS:	
There are a many ways that conduct to seeming Honour, and some of them very dirty ones.

---

## CARD:	
Throw to the devil
Thy melancholy. 

---

The fire burns well;
What need we keep a stirring of't, and make A greater smother? 

---

thou wilt kill Antonio?

---

## BOS:	
Yes. You shall find me ready.

---




O, poor, Antonio, though nothing be so needful To thy estate, as pity, yet I find
Nothing so dangerous! 

---

I must look to my footing: In such slippery ice-pavements, men had need
To be frost-nail'd well, 

---

they may break their necks else; The precedent's here afore me. 

---

Well, good Antonio,
I'll seek thee out; and all my cares shall be To put thee into safety from the reach
Of these most cruel biters, 

---

that have got Some of thy blood already. 

---

It may be, I'll join with thee, in a most just revenge:


---

The weakest arm is strong enough, that strikes
With the sword of justice. 

---

Still methinks the duchess Haunts me: there, there!- 'tis nothing but my melancholy. O Penitence, let me truly taste thy cup,


---

That throws men down, only to raise them up!

---

## CARD:	
O, my conscience!

---


I would pray now; but the devil takes away my heart For having any confidence in prayer.

---


About this hour I appointed Bosola: when she hath served my turn,
She dies.

---

## BOS:	
Ha! 'twas the cardinal's voice; I heard him name Bosola, and my death: listen, I hear one's footing.

---

## FERD:	
Strangling is a very quiet death.

---

## BOS:	
Nay then, I see I must stand upon my guard.

---

## FERD:	
What say to that? whisper softly; do you agree to't?

---


So, it must be done i'th' dark; the cardinal
Would not for a thousand pounds the doctor should see it.

---

## BOS:	
My death is plotted; here's the consequence of murder.

---


We value not desert nor Christian breath,
When we know black deeds must be cur'd with death.

---

## ANT:	
Could I take him at his prayers,
There were hope of pardon.

---

## BOS:	
Fall right my sword:

I'll not give thee so much leisure as to pray. 

---

## ANT:
O, I am gone! Thou hast ended a long suit
In a minute.

---

## BOS:	
What art thou?

---

## ANT:	
A most wretched thing,
That only have the benefit in death, To appear myself. Bosola!

---

## BOS:	
Smother thy pity, thou art dead else.- Antonio!

---


The one I would have sav'd 'bove mine own life!

---


We are merely the stars' tennis-balls, struck and banded Which way please them. O good Antonio,
I'll whisper one thing in thy dying ear, Shall make thy heart break quickly!

---


Thy fair duchess is murder'd.

---

## ANT:	
Some have wish'd to die
At the hearing of sad tidings; 

---

I am glad
That I shall do't in sadness: 

---

I would not now
Wish my wounds balm'd nor heal'd, 

---

for I have no use To put my life to. I do not ask
The process of my death; only commend me To Delia.

---

## BOS:	
Break, heart!

---

## BOS:	
O my fate moves swift!

---


I have this cardinal in the forge already,
Now I'll bring him to th' hammer. O direful misprision! I will not imitate things glorious,
No more than base; I'll be mine own example.- On, on, and look thou represent, for silence, The thing thou bear'st.

---

## CARD:	
I am puzzled in a question about hell: He says, in hell there's one material fire, And yet it shall not burn all men alike.

---


Lay him by. How tedious is a guilty conscience!

---




Now, art thou come? thou look'st ghastly; There sits in thy face some great determination, Mix'd with some fear.

---

## BOS:	
Thus it lightens into action: I am come to kill thee.

---

## CARD:	
Ha! help! our guard!

---

## BOS:	
Thou art deceiv'd;
They are out of thy howling.

---

## CARD:	
Hold; and I will faithfully divide Revenues with thee.

---

## BOS:	
Thy prayers and proffers Are both unseasonable.

---

## CARD:	
What cause hast thou to pursue my life? 

---

## BOS:
Look there.

---

## CARD:	
Antonio!

---

## BOS:	
Slain by my hand unwittingly:
Pray, and be sudden: when thou kill'd'st thy sister, Thou took'st from justice her most equal balance, And left her nought but her sword.

---

## CARD:	
O mercy!

---

## BOS:	
Now it seems thy greatness was only outward; For thou fall'st faster of thyself, than calamity Can drive thee: I'll not waste longer time; there.

---

## CARD:	
Thou hast hurt me. Shall I die like a leveret, Without any resistance? Help, help, help!

---

## FERD:	
Th' alarum! give me a fresh horse; Rally the vaunt-guard, or the day is lost.

---


Yield, yield: I give you the honours of arms, Shake my sword over you; will you yield?

---

## CARD:	
Help me, I am your brother!

---

## FERD:	
The devil! my brother fight upon the adverse party!

---




There flies your ransom.

---

## CARD:	
O justice!

---


I suffer now for what hath former bin:
Sorrow is held the eldest child of sin.	

---

## BOS:	
Now my revenge is perfect. Sink, thou main cause


Of my undoing. The last part of my life Hath done me best service.

---

## FERD:	
Give me some wet hay, I am broken-winded.

---


I do account this world but a dog-kennel:
I will vault credit and affect high pleasures, Beyond death.

---

## BOS:	
He seems to come to himself, now he's so near the bottom. 

---

## FERD:
My sister, O my sister! there's the cause on't.

---


Whether we fall by ambition, blood, or lust,
Like diamonds, we are cut with our own dust.

---

## DEL:	
O, sad disaster! How comes this?

---

## BOS:	
Revenge for the Duchess of Malfi, murder'd By the Arragonian brethren; for Antonio, 

---

Slain by this hand; for lustful Julia, Poison'd by this man; and lastly for myself, 

---

That was an actor in the main of all
Much 'gainst mine own good nature, yet i'th' end Neglected.

---

## DEL:	
Thou wretched thing of blood, How came Antonio by their death?

---

## BOS:	
In a mist: I know not how:
Such a mistake as I have often seen In a play. O, I am gone!

---


It may be pain, but no harm to me to die,
In so good a quarrel. O, this gloomy world! In what a shadow, or deep pit of darkness, Doth feaful mankind live!

---


Let worthy minds ne'er stagger in distrust To suffer death or shame for what is just: Mine is another voyage.

---

## DELIA:	
These wretched eminent things
Leave no more fame behind 'em, than should one Fall in a frost, and leave his print in snow:


---

As soon as the sun shines, it ever melts, Both form and matter. 

---

I have ever thought Nature doth nothing so great for great men,


---

As when she's pleas'd to make them lords of truth: Integrity of life is fame's best friend,
Which nobly, beyond death, shall crown the end.

---

The End.
