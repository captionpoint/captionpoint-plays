SETTING
New York City.
The living room of a gloomy three-story house on the East Side.


TIME
The late 1880s.




Note on the Set

AUTHOR’S NOTES

The house is a worn relic of a more abundant time. What was once opulence has given way – through poverty, age and neglect – to decadence.
The room itself is laden with dark woodwork, heavy curtains and well-worn rugs. Sturdy, if not elegant, furniture. Key pieces include two desks – a larger one (featuring a locked drawer), and a smaller “secretary”; a small eating table with chairs; a cabinet and sideboard holding glassware; and Mr. Manningham’s upholstered chair. A bell cord is in place to summon the servants. A coal fireplace attempts to warm the room.
Sliding double-doors upstage provide access to the hallway and front door. A stairway leads up to the second floor. A door at one side of the stage leads to a large walk-in closet.
The gas lamps which light the room are prominently featured.











There are no beautiful surfaces without a terrible depth.

ACT ONE
(The Manningham Home. 5 PM.) (At rise, a clock is chiming the hour.)
(MR. MANNINGHAM (JACK) – handsome,
well-dressed and groomed – seems to be asleep in his upholstered chair. A newspaper lies on his lap.)
(MRS. MANNINGHAM (BELLA) – a former
beauty queen, also well-dressed – sits in a simpler chair, nearby. She is knitting.)
(The lamps are not yet lit.)
(BELLA takes a break from her knitting and stares admiringly at her husband. This picture of perfect contentment holds for a moment. Then… BELLA returns to her knitting, as –)
(Outside, the sound of a bell.)
(Hearing this, BELLA sets down her knitting and, with a mischievous smile, moves to the bell cord in the room – being careful not to wake her husband. She pulls the cord.)
(BELLA quietly tiptoes to her small “secretary” desk and removes a few coins from a drawer or work box.)




1
(ELIZABETH, the senior maid, enters. Before ELIZABETH can speak, BELLA puts a finger to her own lips.)
(BELLA hands ELIZABETH some coins, and begins to whisper to her, as –)
JACK. (Calmly, eyes closed.) What are you doing, Bella?
BELLA. (Brightly.) Nothing at all, Jack. Enjoy your rest.
(BELLA whispers again to ELIZABETH, handing over the coins.)
JACK. (With a smirk.) You are doing something, Bella.
Tell me what it is.
BELLA. (Enjoying this.) No, I will not tell you what it is.
(ELIZABETH nods and exits.)
(BELLA closes the door quietly behind her.)
JACK. (Eyes still closed.) Where have you sent the maid, Bella?
BELLA. (With a smile.) Now, what makes you think I’ve done that?
JACK. I know Elizabeth’s footsteps. I know the sound of my own door.
BELLA. But do you know the sound of the bakery man’s bell? He’s just outside with his pushcart. I thought it would be a nice surprise to have sweet rolls with our tea.
(JACK opens his eyes. He smiles.) JACK. That would be a very sweet surprise. BELLA. Good.
JACK. Though I’d prefer oysters.
BELLA. (A disgusted face.) Oysters?!
JACK. Did you know, Bella: on the Avenue, there are now two dozen pushcarts selling oysters. Packed in ice. Fresh from the bay.
BELLA. I had no idea you liked oysters, Jack.
JACK. Adventure, Bella! – That is what makes life worth living.
BELLA. (Lightly.) Well, I’m sorry you don’t find my sweet rolls adventuresome enough.
JACK. It’s a nice thing you’ve thought of.
BELLA. (Brightly.) And what’s more: I found your cuff links that had gone missing. Your favorite ones.
(BELLA hands JACK the cuff links.)
JACK. Found them where? BELLA. In my desk, of all places. JACK. Thank you.
(JACK notices the fireplace.)
Oh, the fire is in ashes. Could you ring the bell? BELLA. But I’ve just sent Elizabeth out for the rolls. JACK. Then ring for Nancy, the new one.
BELLA. (With a laugh.) I can do it myself! If it’s merely to put a piece of coal on the fire, I can do that easily!
(BELLA goes to the coal bucket. She lifts a tool to procure a piece of coal.)
JACK. (In a calm voice.) Bella, why do you suppose I employ our two maids?
BELLA. To serve us, of course. But I think from time to time we should consider their feelings – in the same way we ask them to consider ours.
JACK. Do you think I don’t consider them?
BELLA. No, I’m not saying that –
JACK. Do I not consider Elizabeth to the tune of twenty-three dollars per year? And the young one, Nancy – at a rate of eleven dollars per year? That’s nearly thirty-five dollars per year of my consideration.
(With a wry smile, BELLA pointedly sets the tool down.)
(She pulls the bell cord.)
What’s the weather doing?
BELLA. The fog is awful. I’m sure you won’t want to venture out tonight.
(A knock at the door to the room.) (Immediately.) Come in, Nancy.
(NANCY enters, coy and mischievous. She
stands there, staring at BELLA.)
NANCY. What is it, ma’am?
BELLA. Your uniform. It needs pressing.
NANCY. Oh, yes. I’ll get right to that. I thought you rang the bell.
JACK. She did ring the bell.
BELLA. We need some coal. Some coal put on the fire.
(NANCY sees the piece of coal that BELLA had readied.)
NANCY. Like that piece of coal right there?
BELLA. Yes. That’s what we need. Right away.
NANCY. (An impudent smirk.) Yes. Indeed. Right away.
(NANCY lifts the tool and puts the coal in the fireplace. This takes all of about three seconds.)
There we are.
BELLA. Thank you, Nancy.
JACK. And you might as well light the lamps.
NANCY. Right away, sir.
(JACK watches NANCY as she lights the gas lamps in the room.)
(BELLA begins to put away her knitting.)
BELLA. Nancy, I wonder if you’ve learned to knit? It’s a fine hobby.
NANCY. I think I’ll take it up when I am much older.
(BELLA turns to JACK.)
JACK. You’re acting rather sassy today, Nancy. Like you have a delicious secret of some kind.
NANCY. (As she works.) No secrets at all.
JACK. Perhaps you’ve added another broken heart to your list.
BELLA. Jack, that’s enough.
JACK. (With a laugh.) I imagine that when you go out, you must leave a dozen boys in your wake.
NANCY. (To BELLA.) Will there be anything else, ma’am?
JACK. It must be those mysterious lotions you employ to keep your skin so lovely.


JACK. You know, Mrs. Manningham was a beauty pageant winner in her day. But in recent years, she has lost her radiance. I wonder if you’d share your secrets with her.
(BELLA gives JACK a hard look.)
BELLA. That will be all, Nancy.
JACK. Except for the sweet rolls my wife has so kindly ordered.
NANCY. Is Elizabeth getting those for you?
JACK. Yes, though I had hoped for oysters instead. Have you ever had an oyster?
BELLA. (Sharp.) Please bring our rolls at once.
NANCY. Yes, ma’am.
(NANCY leaves the room.)
BELLA. Why do you do that?
JACK. Do what?
BELLA. Humiliate me in front of the servants.
JACK. I was saving you from humiliation. You are too familiar with her.
BELLA. No, I certainly am not –
JACK. You say you want the servants treated as equals, so I ask the girl about her activities. Then you say you don’t want to be her equal, but you won’t order her to manage the fire!
BELLA. That girl laughs at me, Jack! Every day she sneers at me behind my back.
JACK. (Lightly.) What an imagination you have! That girl
admires you.
BELLA. She most certainly does not.
JACK. Of course she does! She’s told me as much! But your imagination – the power of your busy mind – it blinds you to what is real.
(BELLA is looking away.)
Bella…?
(JACK sings what must be a simple little “pet song” between them:)
(Quietly.) BELLA, BELLA… SMILE FOR YOUR FELLA…
BELLA. (Not in the mood.) No, Jack…
JACK. (Continues singing.)
BELLA, BELLA… SWEET AND DARLING ONE.
BELLA. It’s not going to work this time…
JACK. (He smiles.) You really are a perfect little silly, you know that? You read dire meanings into everything.
(BELLA stares at him…slowly warming to his charms once again.)
BELLA. I do, don’t I?
JACK. I’ve just thought of something nice. Why don’t you come over here.
BELLA. Tell me.
JACK. (Mischievously.) I will tell you when you come over here.
BELLA. (Playing along.) If I come over there, you’ll tell me the nice thing?
JACK. Yes, I will.
(BELLA considers.)
BELLA. (Coyly.) I will come halfway.
JACK. (Also coy.) Then I will only tell you half of it.
(BELLA considers. Smiles. Goes to him. She sits on his lap.)
JACK. Now: I’ve just read that Mr. Booth – the celebrated actor – will tour to New York this season.
BELLA. Yes, I read that as well.
(She stops, looks at him.)
Oh, Jack…you don’t mean…?
(JACK smiles at her. He nods.)
Are you serious? You’d take me to see Edwin Booth on Broadway?!
JACK. Not only will we see Mr. Booth – but I will see that we are invited backstage.
BELLA. Oh, that’s a perfect heaven!
JACK. Now – the engagement is brief, so we must choose a night.
BELLA. You choose, Jack – any night! – any night at all!
JACK. You haven’t even asked what he is playing.
BELLA. It’s a tragedy, I bet. He is noted for tragedy. Oh, Jack – I’m so happy! – but what made you offer this?
(Before he can respond.) Is it because I’ve been better? I have been better, haven’t I?
JACK. Yes, you have.
BELLA. And you’ve been better, too.
JACK. What do you mean by that?
BELLA. This past week you have been so kind to me, so attentive. The ghastly dreams I was having – they seem to have vanished for good.
JACK. That means your medicine is working.
BELLA. No, it’s not the medicine! It is the serenity of a clear mind. I want you to understand that, Jack.
JACK. (With a laugh.) Don’t I seem to?
BELLA. Yes, but –
JACK. Haven’t I just said I’m taking you to the theatre?!
BELLA. Yes, you have! And you have made me so happy!
(BELLA kisses him, as –) (Knocking is heard at the door.)
(With confidence.) Come in!
(NANCY enters with a tea service, as well as a covered plate.)
(NANCY starts toward the sideboard.)
Thank you – but not there, Nancy. We will have our sweet rolls on the table today.
NANCY. All right, then…here we are.
(NANCY sets the covered plate on the table. During what follows, she will pour the tea.)
BELLA. Did you know, Nancy, that Mr. Manningham will be taking me to the theatre.
NANCY. Well, good for him.
BELLA. Tell me: if you were to see a play, would you wish for a comedy or a tragedy?
NANCY. I’d wish for a big ol’ bang-up musical. Lots of dancing – with maybe a dog act in the middle.
BELLA. We will be seeing the great Edwin Booth.
NANCY. Oh, the brother of the shooter.
BELLA. Mr. Booth is the greatest tragic actor in the world.
NANCY. But can he play the zither? Make a bird appear outta his mouth?
BELLA. How dare you –
JACK. (With a laugh.) Maybe the girl is right, Bella.
Perhaps a musical would lighten your mind.
(From his newspaper.) There’s something here called
Tita in Tibet.
NANCY. That might do it!
BELLA. (Strong.) Listen to me, both of you: I want a tragedy and I shall have one.
(Beat.)
JACK. That will be all, Nancy.
(NANCY does a little curtsy toward BELLA, then leaves.)
BELLA. You’re right, Jack: I have been too familiar with her. From now on I will put my foot down.
JACK. Hear, hear! I must offer to take you to the theatre more often.
BELLA. Yes, you must! Now – let’s sit and enjoy our rolls.
Here, at the perfect table for two. You on one side…
(JACK takes a chair at the table.)
And me on the other.
(BELLA sits across from him.)
There we are. What could be better?
(BELLA uncovers the plate and discovers: oysters.)
Oh, no…
JACK. Oysters! Look at that!
BELLA. …Jack, I’m going to be sick…
JACK. Oysters on the half-shell. You’re a sneaky little Pete, my darling!
BELLA. She did this. That conniving little Nancy did this!
(ELIZABETH enters with a tray which holds an identical covered plate.)
ELIZABETH. I have your sweet rolls, ma’am.
BELLA. Set them here, Elizabeth.
ELIZABETH. (Seeing the oysters.) What on earth?!
BELLA. And take those slimy things away!
ELIZABETH. Right away, ma’am.
(ELIZABETH replaces the plate of oysters with the plate of sweet rolls. She leaves.)
BELLA. I can’t imagine how anyone could eat those things.
(BELLA readies their sweet rolls – spreading jam on Jack’s roll first, then on her own.)
JACK. But that’s the trick, Bella. To imagine yourself as someone else. To don a character – like Mr. Booth does.
BELLA. You could have done that, Jack. I believe you could have been an actor of some renown.
JACK. (Flattered.) Do you really think so?
BELLA. You are smart and charming. I’m sure you could persuade everyone that you are something you’re not.
JACK. That’s the goal, all right.
BELLA. (Lightly.) And I would be there at the stage door every night – waiting amid the rush of your admirers.
JACK. (Playing along.) Not every night!
BELLA. Absolutely – I’d be there to keep an eye on all those hussies who would be after you.
JACK. Oh, I didn’t know there would be hussies!
BELLA. (In fun.) I’m wise to all of them! – You will never escape from me! Oh – aren’t these rolls delicious? I know I am rambling on and on – but it’s because I’m happy.
(JACK is looking over BELLA’s shoulder – toward the fireplace.)
I can’t remember a time when I was so deliriously happy.
(BELLA becomes aware of JACK’s silence.)
Jack. Is something wrong?
JACK. Indeed there is.
BELLA. I think you’re joking with me.
JACK. Look there, at the wall.
BELLA. (Still lightly.) All right! – I am looking at the wall.
JACK. Don’t you see that something is missing?
(BELLA looks at the wall.)
BELLA. Oh, yes…the portrait.
JACK. The portrait of my father has been removed.
BELLA. Yes. Why is that?
JACK. Please retrieve it from where you have hidden it.
BELLA. I didn’t hide it.
JACK. You’re sure of that?
BELLA. Someone must have come in and moved it.
JACK. Someone other than you?
BELLA. Yes, of course.
JACK. Do you mean to say there are people in this house playing tricks on you?
BELLA. No – I didn’t say that –
JACK. It’s a simple question, Bella: where has the painting gone?
BELLA. I have no idea.
(JACK says nothing.)
(A hard laugh.) What more can I say? Do you want me to place my hand on a Bible and swear an oath?!
(JACK stares at her. Then he pulls the bell cord.)
JACK. As you wish.
BELLA. (Urgently.) No, Jack – you don’t need to call the servants in – we can solve this on our own –
(ELIZABETH enters.)
JACK. Come in, Elizabeth. And please shut the door.
ELIZABETH. What is it, sir?
JACK. The painting of my father has been taken down.
ELIZABETH. So it has.
JACK. Was that portrait hanging in its place when you dusted the room this morning?
ELIZABETH. Yes, sir.
JACK. But now it is gone. Why is that?
ELIZABETH. I assume it is being cleaned, or perhaps re-framed.
JACK. You assume?
ELIZABETH. It’s your painting, sir. I expect you know where it is.
JACK. But I don’t, Elizabeth. It has been removed without my consent.
ELIZABETH. (Concerned, to BELLA.) Perhaps there’s been a theft.
JACK. Nothing of the kind.
ELIZABETH. I should contact the police –
JACK. There is no need to involve the police. A painting has gone missing, and you claim to have no idea where it’s gone.
ELIZABETH. That’s correct.
JACK. Would you swear on it?
ELIZABETH. I have given you my word, sir.
(JACK removes a Bible from a shelf, or drawer.)
JACK. Yes, I know. But my wife has said she would swear on the Holy Bible. Would you do the same?
(ELIZABETH stares at him, hard.) (JACK holds out the Bible.)
(ELIZABETH looks at BELLA. Then, ELIZABETH
puts her hand on the Bible.)
ELIZABETH. (Curt.) I swear.
(ELIZABETH removes her hand and begins to turn away –)
JACK. And would you kiss the Bible?


JACK. To settle the matter once and for all. Would you kiss the Bible as a sign of your truthfulness?
ELIZABETH. What has come over you, sir?!
JACK. I shall tell you, Elizabeth: I want the truth to be told in this home. Now, can you do that? Or are you lying to me?
ELIZABETH. (A steely look at JACK.) No one dare call me a liar. Sir.
(ELIZABETH kisses the Bible. She stares hard at JACK.)
JACK. Thank you, Elizabeth. Please send Nancy in at once.
(ELIZABETH exits, leaving the door open.)
BELLA. Jack, please stop this. I will confess! I did it! I took down that portrait and I hid it away! There. Let that be the end of it –
(NANCY enters.)
NANCY. Elizabeth said you wanted me.
JACK. I’d like you to look at the wall behind you, Nancy.
Do you notice anything missing?
NANCY. The painting is gone.
JACK. Yes.
NANCY. But I don’t know who’d want it. It’s awful.
JACK. I am not interested in your views on art, Nancy. I want to know if you took that portrait down from the wall.
NANCY. (A look at BELLA.) Did she accuse me of this?
BELLA. I did nothing of the kind.
NANCY. I never touched that painting.
JACK. (Holds out the Bible.) I must have your solemn vow that you are telling the truth.
NANCY. (Hand on Bible.) I swear that I am.
JACK. And as further proof: I shall need you to kiss this Bible.
(NANCY stares at BELLA. Then…)
(NANCY kisses the Bible. She looks up into
JACK’s eyes.)
NANCY. Like that?
JACK. Thank you, Nancy. You may go.
(NANCY goes. JACK turns to BELLA.)
Well, Bella – that settles it.
BELLA. Give me that Bible!
JACK. No – there’s no need –
(BELLA grabs the Bible from JACK and begins kissing it.)
BELLA. There! – I am kissing it! – Do you see?! – Are you happy now?! There is your evidence – there is your proof –
JACK. For God’s sake, Bella –
BELLA. I swear before Almighty God that I never touched that picture!
(Silence. Stand-off.)
(JACK speaks with an odd, empathic calm:)
JACK. Then you are mad.
BELLA. (Quietly.) What did you say?
JACK. You are mad, my darling – and you don’t know what you’ve done.
BELLA. No – Jack – don’t say that –
JACK. You poor thing.
BELLA. You promised.
JACK. You are mad like your mother before you.
BELLA. Promised you’d never say that again.
JACK. The time has come to face facts, Bella. I have done all that I can for you, but I’m not an expert – I’m not a doctor –
BELLA. But you are my husband!
JACK. (Overlapping.) – and because of that I am no longer equipped to care for you.
BELLA. (Desperate.) Please, Jack – you must treat me with kindness. If I did take that picture down – I have no memory of it!
JACK. And the other items? My keys and cuff links and handkerchiefs –
BELLA. Yes! All those things! When they have gone missing – I did not know I had done it! These are innocent acts of mischief, nothing more!
(Before JACK can respond.) Let me try, Jack. I’m sure I can find the painting. It’s nothing that logic cannot solve.
JACK. Bella –
BELLA. (She looks around, considering.) Now: had it been taken out of the room, someone would have seen it come and go…so, it must be within these walls.
JACK. There’s no point in –
BELLA. (Gaining strength.) It is rather large, so it can’t be in one of the drawers. It would be visible if placed under one of the chairs or tables. Thus, it would have to be placed vertically…it would have to be hidden…
(She goes to a bookcase or other unit. She looks behind it.)
…here.
(A victory.)
And yes. Here it is! You see!
(BELLA produces the portrait.)
JACK. So you knew.
BELLA. No…
JACK. You knew all along.
BELLA. I reasoned it out! I used my own powers of logic.
I did not hide it, Jack. I found it.
(BELLA restores the portrait to its place on the wall.)
There we are. Your beloved father looking down on us once again! All is back to normal.
(She moves to her chair and sits.)
We are having our tea and our sweet rolls and everything is lovely. Won’t you sit with me? We can talk about the night we shall see Edwin Booth on Broadway.
(BELLA turns, awaiting his response, but –)
(JACK has vanished into the large closet.)
Jack? …Darling? …Where have you gone?
(JACK emerges from the closet with his overcoat and hat.)
JACK. Only to get my coat. I have business to tend to.
BELLA. But why tonight? Can’t we –?
(He retrieves her medicine, setting it near her.)
JACK. Here is your medicine.
(He retrieves a blanket. Wraps it kindly around her shoulders.)
And a blanket. For the chill in the room. Is there anything more you need?
BELLA. Jack…
JACK. I won’t be late.
(BELLA stares at him.)
BELLA. Be as late as you need. I’ll be fine.
JACK. Oh – I will be passing the grocer on my way. I might as well pay our bill. Where is it, dear? I gave you the grocery bill yesterday.
BELLA. Yes. It’s on my desk.
(JACK is looking through the papers atop Bella’s small secretary desk.)
It should be right on top. I put it there this afternoon.
JACK. Are you sure it’s here? …I’m not seeing it… BELLA. Yes, I’m sure it is there. Under the paperweight. JACK. Perhaps you put it in one of the drawers?
(JACK is looking through the drawers in Bella’s desk.)
BELLA. No – not in a drawer – it should be right on top –
JACK. It’s not here. Maybe you put it on my desk?
BELLA. No – I never go near your desk, you know that!
(BELLA stands and approaches him.)
JACK. Calm yourself, Bella – you are getting excited –


BELLA. You are going to say I’ve taken it! Aren’t you?! You are going to accuse me of hiding the grocery bill – like you accuse me of everything else!
(JACK grabs her by the shoulders – not in anger, but to steady her.)
JACK. (Slowly, calmly.) Please, Bella! Listen to me. I am worried about you. You need help. We both need help.
BELLA. Then we will help each other –
JACK. If only we could. But your fate is no longer in my hands. That power now belongs to the doctors at the asylum.
BELLA. What doctors?! I haven’t seen any doctors –
JACK. I’ve tried to convince them – but the doctors say I’ve been too lenient with you, too accommodating of your behavior. They may need to intervene.
BELLA. There must be something I can do.
JACK. Yes. While I am gone, you can find that bill from the grocer, and you can put it on my desk. Can you do that?
BELLA. (Nodding, desperate.) And we are still going to the theatre, yes? We are going to see Mr. Booth on Broadway, and we will go backstage, and –
JACK. Oh, Bella. That will never happen now.
(JACK leaves.)
(BELLA is motionless, distraught, for a long moment. Then –)
(BELLA rushes to her desk and rummages through every pile, every drawer once again, seeking the missing grocery bill – finding nothing.)
(BELLA collapses into her chair, frustrated and spent. Then…)
(BELLA becomes aware of the gas lamps in the room growing brighter – the flames growing taller. This seems to mesmerize her for a long moment…is this really happening? … And she is drawn toward the strange, surreal, flickering flames…and then…)
(Knocking at the door, as –)
(The flames grow normal once again, and –)
(BELLA moves to her medicine. BELLA places the hideous-tasting medicine on her tongue.)
(More knocking, urgent, as –)
(BELLA attempts to pour herself a glass of water, but her hands are shaking violently, water is spilling everywhere, as –)
(ELIZABETH enters, quickly.) ELIZABETH. Madam! – I was knocking – BELLA. Not now, Elizabeth!
ELIZABETH. – There is someone here for you –
BELLA. – No – I couldn’t possibly see anyone –
ELIZABETH. Your hands – they are shaking so!
BELLA. My medicine – I must take my medicine –
(ELIZABETH takes Bella’s medicine and sets it aside.)
ELIZABETH. (Firmly.) No – no more of that – it’s not good for you –
BELLA. But Jack says –
ELIZABETH. (Overlapping.) – I don’t know why he’s making you take that.
BELLA. Because I am going mad, Elizabeth. That is the doctors’ diagnosis.
ELIZABETH. What doctors? You have not seen a single doctor!
BELLA. Jack’s going to have me committed.
ELIZABETH. No! I won’t listen to talk like that! Now: there is a gentleman at the door –
BELLA. Send him away –
ELIZABETH. – He is determined to see you.
BELLA. – No, I am not fit to be seen –
ELIZABETH. You are going to hold up, Madam – You are going to hold up and be strong –
BELLA. But Jack does not want me to have visitors –
ELIZABETH. That is not for your husband to decide! Listen to me: I will call this gentleman in and you will speak with him.
BELLA. But Elizabeth –
ELIZABETH. You must be brave! (ELIZABETH has left the room.)
(BELLA is alone, lost and bereft. An odd, quiet moment ensues:)
(She turns away and walks to the fireplace. She stares up at the portrait. Her back is to the door, as –)
(SERGEANT ROUGH enters. He is a whirlwind of wisdom, candor, mischief and warmth. He can be brusque, caustic, overbearing or remarkably charming – whatever the moment requires. He is armed with a ready and inviting laugh.)
SERGEANT ROUGH. (Re: the portrait.) The eyes – so vivid.
The gaze so full of hunger.
(BELLA turns to SERGEANT ROUGH, startled.)
I assume you knew the man depicted in that painting.
BELLA. No. That is my husband’s father. I never met him.
(SERGEANT ROUGH is taking off his hat. He remains near the door.)
SERGEANT ROUGH. You are Mrs. Manningham, I believe.
BELLA. Yes, but…
SERGEANT ROUGH. (Buoyantly.) “Why” – you are rightly wondering – “is this age-ed carnival of a man standing in my home?!”
BELLA. You must be here to see my husband.
SERGEANT ROUGH. The fact is: I am here to see you, and you alone.
(As he speaks, SERGEANT ROUGH takes off his overcoat and scarf. He sets his hat directly atop Jack’s desk.)
Might I just say: you are younger and more attractive than I could have imagined. I note that simply because it is a fact, and I am in the business of discovering facts.
(His coat, scarf, and hat are fully off.)
SERGEANT ROUGH. May I take off my coat?
BELLA. I believe you already have.
SERGEANT ROUGH. (A bright smile.) Well – look at that!
BELLA. (Firmly.) Really – sir: you must say why you are here.
SERGEANT ROUGH. (With a laugh.) Oh, you are running ahead, Mrs. Manningham. I promise you: all will be answered in time. Please know you are perfectly safe with me. I’ve stationed your senior maid, Elizabeth, just outside the door.
(Calls offstage.) ELIZABETH – ARE YOU THERE?
ELIZABETH’S VOICE. (From offstage.) YES, SIR. RIGHT HERE.
SERGEANT ROUGH. I’ve asked her to enter immediately should either of us so much as raise our voice.
BELLA. And yet you’ve not told me who you are. SERGEANT ROUGH. Oh, just a plain police detective. BELLA. Police?
SERGEANT ROUGH. And not one you would have heard of – since news of my exploits rarely traveled beyond Scotland Yard.
BELLA. Scotland Yard – in London?
SERGEANT ROUGH. Had you been on my side of the Atlantic, you might have heard of the man who brought Sandham the Throttler to justice!
BELLA. That case was in the papers here!
SERGEANT ROUGH. Well, Madam, you are looking at the man who gave Sandham the Throttler over to the authorities who throttled him! Rough is the name. Sergeant Rough, Scotland Yard, twenty years in Her Majesty’s service. And now retired.
(SERGEANT ROUGH takes a step toward
BELLA.)
I wonder if you’d agree to look into my eyes.
BELLA. But, why?
SERGEANT ROUGH. Do you believe you are looking at someone to whom you can give your complete trust and faith?
BELLA. But you are a stranger to me.
SERGEANT ROUGH. And you to me. Even still: in your eyes I see a woman who has traveled down a path of sorrow and doubt for a very long time.
(This lands with BELLA.)
And in my eyes, I hope you’ll see a man who has come to help her.
BELLA. In what way?
(SERGEANT ROUGH moves away, looking around.)
SERGEANT ROUGH. Mrs. Manningham, I told you I was in the business of discovering facts. Well, here is another: by the look of things, I seem to have interrupted your tea.
BELLA. Oh – no – Jack and I were sitting here earlier – SERGEANT ROUGH. Just before he went out to his club? BELLA. Yes. But how do you know that?
SERGEANT ROUGH. May I ask you something of the utmost importance?
BELLA. I suppose so, yes.
SERGEANT ROUGH. Would there be a bit of tea left for me?
(A blank beat, as BELLA stares at him – then, quickly –)
BELLA. Oh, yes! – You must forgive my manners –
SERGEANT ROUGH. With a lump or two of sugar?
(BELLA moves toward the bell cord.)
BELLA. – Of course – I’m sorry – I will call for Elizabeth –
SERGEANT ROUGH. Oh, let’s not disturb the maid. We can do this on our own, can’t we?
BELLA. Yes! Of course we can! I will fetch you a clean cup.
SERGEANT ROUGH. That’s splendid.
(They work together to prepare the tea: BELLA gets a clean cup from the sideboard, SERGEANT ROUGH procures the sugar bowl.)
BELLA. (As they work.) Sergeant Rough, may I tell you something?
SERGEANT ROUGH. Of course.
BELLA. I have never done this.
SERGEANT ROUGH. And by this you mean?
BELLA. Been here, in this room. With a guest of my own. SERGEANT ROUGH. Your husband would frown on that? BELLA. I’m afraid so.
SERGEANT ROUGH. And yet, he leaves you alone. Goes out to his club in the evenings.
BELLA. He has business dealings there. But how do you know that?
SERGEANT ROUGH. There is a leak, Mrs. Manningham.
A leak in this house.
BELLA. I beg your pardon.
SERGEANT ROUGH. I have in my employ a young man named Booker. This Mr. Booker fancies a young woman named Nancy – who I believe works for you as a maid.
BELLA. Yes, she does –
SERGEANT ROUGH. Let me assure you that nothing happens in your house that Nancy does not tell Booker – and that Booker does not tell me.
BELLA. (Livid.) I knew it! I knew she talked about us! – And now that I have proof, I will have her dismissed at once!
SERGEANT ROUGH. Oh, that is the last thing you should do! Before this night is out, I suspect Nancy will become a great ally of yours.
BELLA. What is this mystery? You seem determined to keep me in the dark!
SERGEANT ROUGH. Because I am still quite in the dark myself! May I have just one more lump of sugar?
(BELLA passes the container to him.)
(SERGEANT ROUGH puts multiple lumps of sugar in his tea, as he continues…)
Now. This remarkable house: how did you find it?
BELLA. My husband found it.
SERGEANT ROUGH. It must have cost him a pretty penny.
BELLA. It was my money, actually. As an only child, I had come into an inheritance.
SERGEANT ROUGH. That’s a fine turn of events.
BELLA. In my case, no. My father died. My mother was sent away. My other relatives have stopped speaking to me.
SERGEANT ROUGH. I’m sorry.
BELLA. But, my husband found this house, and he believed it would be a good investment.
SERGEANT ROUGH. I’m sure he did. Tell me: when your husband is away, do you have free run of this house?
BELLA. Well, no – not the upper floor.
SERGEANT ROUGH. When you say “upper floor”…?
BELLA. Above us here, on the second floor, are the bedrooms. But, above that, there is a third floor. It is locked up.
SERGEANT ROUGH. Why is that?
BELLA. When we first took the house, Jack said we wouldn’t need the upper floor. It is never used. For that reason – among others – I never go up there.
SERGEANT ROUGH. Who was it chose this house – you or your husband?
BELLA. Jack chose it.
SERGEANT ROUGH. I see. And when, in fact, did you –?
BELLA. (Sudden, sharp.) I hate this house. I always have.
(Beat.)
Oh, that felt good. It felt so good to say that out loud.
(SERGEANT ROUGH moves near the stairs.)
SERGEANT ROUGH. You implied there were other reasons you do not visit the upper floor.
BELLA. I’m not sure you will believe me.
SERGEANT ROUGH.	You  would  be  amazed,  Mrs.
Manningham, at my capacity for belief.
(BELLA takes a deep breath.)
BELLA. It’s when I am alone at night – like tonight…that I get the feeling that someone is walking around up there.
SERGEANT ROUGH. Have you told your husband this?
BELLA. No – he would blame it on my “overactive imagination.” But I hear noises nearly every night. Just around this time. And it is more than just footsteps – it is the sound of pounding and scraping, things being moved around.
SERGEANT ROUGH. Did it ever strike you, Mrs. Manningham, that it might be your own husband walking around up there?
(BELLA stares at him.)
BELLA. Yes. I had that very thought. I thought that maybe when Jack leaves this house in the evenings…he comes back here. And he enters the rooms on the upper floor. But how? And what is he doing up there?
SERGEANT ROUGH. What made you first think it was him?
BELLA. The light. The gas light. In this house, I can tell everything by the light of the gas.
(Re: the gas lamps.) You see the lamps there. Right now they are burning full. But if an extra light was turned on – anywhere in the house – that flame would become smaller. And it would remain that way –
SERGEANT ROUGH. – until the other light was turned off!
BELLA. Yes!
SERGEANT ROUGH. – It’s a matter of pressure in the system –
BELLA. At first I tried to reason it out – rushing around to see if anyone had turned on a light in another room.
But, then I began to realize…these lamps lower at the same time every night. Always about ten minutes after Jack leaves for his club. And that gave me the idea that it is Jack who enters those rooms on the upper floor – turns on the lights – and that is what makes these lamps grow dim.
SERGEANT ROUGH. Remarkable!
BELLA. And what’s more: I always know when he is coming home. Because when these gas lights brighten once again –
SERGEANT ROUGH. – that means he is finished upstairs!
BELLA. Yes! And not ten minutes later: I hear his key in the lock.
SERGEANT ROUGH. Mrs. Manningham, that is astounding!
BELLA. You don’t think I’m mad?
SERGEANT ROUGH. I think you would have made a fine detective!
BELLA. Certainly not! My mind is always playing tricks on me. Jack will give me things to look after, and then when he asks for them – they are gone.
SERGEANT ROUGH. And they are never found?
BELLA. (Strong, with passion.) No – it is worse: they are found amid my things. In my closet, or my desk. And I have no memory of putting them there! Just tonight, the grocery bill went missing – and I have no idea why! I live forever now in a world of doubt – not knowing what’s real and what I have invented.
(Confronting SERGEANT ROUGH.) Even now – even you, Sergeant Rough, standing before me in this room: are you really here? – Or have I invented you, as well? Are you only a dream? Has our entire conversation been nothing but a dream?!
(SERGEANT ROUGH looks her squarely in the eyes.)
SERGEANT ROUGH. Be assured, Mrs. Manningham: you are wide awake. And I think you could do with a little medicine.
BELLA. I’ve had my medicine already. I detest it, but Jack makes me take it.
SERGEANT ROUGH. Oh, I am speaking of a different medicine. I may require a dose or two myself. Might you have two glasses? – Something like a tumbler would be best.
(BELLA is moving to the sideboard.)
BELLA. Yes – of course – but –
SERGEANT ROUGH. The medicine I propose has been employed by humanity for ages.
(From his coat, SERGEANT ROUGH produces a small bottle of whiskey.)
One of its many cures is the temporary removal of dark fears and doubts.
BELLA. You are speaking of whiskey.
SERGEANT ROUGH. Good Scotch whiskey, Madam. Pure ambrosia. Liquid courage.
(SERGEANT ROUGH takes the glasses from
BELLA and pours whiskey into each.)
Just a small amount. Here we are –
BELLA. But I do not drink whiskey!
SERGEANT ROUGH. You underestimate yourself, Mrs. Manningham! You’ve no idea what you’re capable of. Not yet.
(SERGEANT ROUGH hands her a glass. He clinks her glass with his.)
To health. And to courage.
(SERGEANT ROUGH drinks.)
(BELLA hesitates…then takes only a small sip…shivering a bit.)
SERGEANT ROUGH. There. Was that so nasty?
(BELLA is staring at her glass.)
BELLA. It was…not.
SERGEANT ROUGH. Good.
BELLA. Not nasty at all. SERGEANT ROUGH. Excellent. BELLA. In fact, I like it very much.
SERGEANT ROUGH. I thought you might.
BELLA. Why have I never done this?
SERGEANT ROUGH. You’ll enjoy it even more if you are sitting down.
(SERGEANT ROUGH gestures for BELLA to sit in Jack’s upholstered chair.)
BELLA. Oh, that’s Jack’s chair. I would never sit in Jack’s chair.
SERGEANT ROUGH. Very well.
(BELLA sits in a different chair, sipping at her whiskey.)
Now: I wonder if you ever heard of a woman named Alice Barlow?
BELLA. I don’t believe so.
SERGEANT ROUGH. Alice Barlow was an elderly widow who lived her whole life in New York City. She used her wealth to better the lives of the least of society’s members – the cabmen, the dock workers, the seamstresses.
BELLA. What a wonderful woman. And Sergeant Rough?
SERGEANT ROUGH. Yes?
BELLA. (The whiskey.) Might I have little more?
(SERGEANT ROUGH pours BELLA more whiskey…)
SERGEANT ROUGH. Alice Barlow knew there was a great deal of pain in the world…but she believed her kindness to those less fortunate was a small contribution to the sum of the world’s happiness.
BELLA. And you knew her?
SERGEANT ROUGH. I had occasion to see her only once:
That was the day her throat was cut and she lay dead on the floor of her home.
BELLA. (Horrified.) Oh, how awful…
SERGEANT ROUGH. I saw that twenty-five years ago – and I have never forgotten it. I had left London and signed on with the New York police force. It was then, as a young officer, that I was assigned to the murder of Alice Barlow.
BELLA. But why was she killed?
SERGEANT ROUGH. Alice Barlow had inherited what were known as the “Barlow rubies” – nine precious and priceless gems. It was well-known that she had hidden these rare gems somewhere in her home. When her body was discovered, only a few trinkets from the house had been taken – however the entire place had been turned upside-down, everything flung madly about. But the Barlow rubies were never found.
The investigation determined that the killer – who was also never found – must have vanished with the priceless gems.
SERGEANT ROUGH. Years went by. I moved back to London. Caught on with Scotland Yard. But, I never stopped thinking about Alice Barlow.
It was presumed she was killed after the robbery to assure her silence.
BELLA. But then how to explain the chaos inside the house?
SERGEANT ROUGH. Exactly! I began to think: what if she was killed first? What if the only person who could have told this criminal where the rubies were hidden –
BELLA. – was the very woman he had just killed?!
SERGEANT ROUGH. YES! Can’t you picture it: the killer ransacking the place – growing more and more desperate – until he must finally escape empty-handed, leaving the blood and wreckage of the house behind?
BELLA. What became of the rubies?
SERGEANT ROUGH. I believe they are still waiting right where Alice Barlow hid them. And what’s more: I believe the killer of Alice Barlow never gave up trying to find those rubies in her home. That he waited for YEARS – and then circled back, renewing the search he began on that terrible night! THAT, Mrs. Manningham, is why I’ve come back.
BELLA. Come back?
SERGEANT ROUGH. Don’t you see: I have been in this house before. I was standing right where you are now when I saw Alice Barlow lying dead on the floor.
BELLA. That can’t be true!
SERGEANT ROUGH. It all happened here. It was in this very room that I interviewed a young man named Sydney Power – who claimed to be a distant nephew. I spoke to young Mr. Power for only a few minutes, but I never forget a face.
That is why just last week, as I walked down the street near this house, I was startled to see that very man – walking directly toward me.
BELLA. Twenty-five years later?
SERGEANT ROUGH. YES. And there was something more: there was a woman on his arm.
(Beat.)
That woman, Mrs. Manningham, was you. (BELLA stares at him in disbelief.)
When I followed the two of you home, I was brought right back to the scene of the crime!
BELLA. No! – That’s impossible!
SERGEANT ROUGH. Your husband is that man, Sydney Power! He murdered Alice Barlow in this house twenty-five years ago! Failing to find the Barlow rubies – he went abroad, waited years for the case to vanish from the news – and then he met you. With your money he gained access to this house. And having gained that, he renewed his search.
(The gas lamps suddenly flicker – growing smaller/dimmer.)
BELLA. Look at the lamps – Jack’s come back!
SERGEANT ROUGH. He is upstairs – searching once again!
BELLA. No, it can’t be –
SERGEANT ROUGH. And the lamps will brighten when he leaves the upper floor. That is perfect!
BELLA. Listen to me –
SERGEANT ROUGH. We shall know exactly how much time we have! The lamps shall be our warning.
BELLA. (Strong.) No more of your outlandish stories! YOU MUST LEAVE HERE AT ONCE!
SERGEANT ROUGH. (Quickly, with passion.) Every night this week I have watched your husband disappear into the alley – climb the fire escape to the roof – and enter the upper floor through a skylight. Once there, he begins his nightly search – which you yourself have heard!
BELLA. But if that were true, I would surely find him out –
SERGEANT ROUGH. Yes –
BELLA. – At some point I would catch him in the act!
SERGEANT ROUGH. Unless he got rid of you.
(Directly, in her eyes.) You are not going mad, Mrs. Manningham. You are slowly and systematically being driven out of your mind.
BELLA. No…
SERGEANT ROUGH. And once you are locked away in an asylum, Sydney Power can search this house with impunity!
BELLA. But that man is my husband!
SERGEANT ROUGH. That man is a rogue and a liar and a relentless creature of the night – haunting the Stage Doors for young actresses –
(BELLA rushes to the bell cord and pulls it –)
BELLA. (Calling offstage.) ELIZABETH!
SERGEANT ROUGH. – prowling his way through the low resorts and shadows of the city.
BELLA. That’s not true – you are saying this to hurt me!
SERGEANT ROUGH. (Strongly.) I am saying this to free you from obligation. Don’t you see: you hold all the power here. YOU ALONE can bring him down!
(This lands with BELLA, just as –)
(ELIZABETH throws opens the door.)
ELIZABETH. I’m here, ma’am! What is it?!
(BELLA stares at ELIZABETH. BELLA stares at
SERGEANT ROUGH.)
You called for me. What may I do for you? (A charged beat. And then:)
(BELLA decides.)
BELLA. Nothing at all.
I believe I can do this on my own.
(ELIZABETH stares at SERGEANT ROUGH.) (SERGEANT ROUGH nods.)
(ELIZABETH leaves the room.)
(Simple, direct.) What is it you need?
SERGEANT ROUGH. We need proof of his true identity. Evidence that links your Jack Manningham to my Sydney Power. Where does he keep his personal papers?
BELLA. That desk there – that is his –
(SERGEANT ROUGH approaches Jack’s desk.)
SERGEANT ROUGH. Excellent.
BELLA. But the main drawer, it is always locked.
SERGEANT ROUGH. Then we must have a look inside!
(SERGEANT ROUGH, unhurried, removes a ring of keys and a small tool kit from his coat.)
SERGEANT ROUGH. Do you know: one of my great regrets is that I never became a professional burglar. I think it would have been a lovely occupation.
BELLA. (Trying to focus him.) Sergeant Rough –
SERGEANT ROUGH. Working alone, with little tools, in a quiet room. Heavenly!
BELLA. – Jack will know we’ve gone through his things.
(SERGEANT ROUGH is trying a series of keys in the lock – without success.)
SERGEANT ROUGH. Not if we are clever. And there is nothing so clever as a key.
(The next key.)
Ha! – Not that one!
(Another key.)
Not that one, either!
(SERGEANT ROUGH is taking off his jacket.)
Would you mind if I took off my jacket? I find I do my best work in my shirt sleeves. There we are. I bet you did not expect me to be wearing such a saucy shirt!
BELLA. Hurry, Sergeant Rough – he is just upstairs!
SERGEANT ROUGH. The keys have all failed us. I fear this lock will need to be picked.
BELLA. No – please –
SERGEANT ROUGH. And I will take great pleasure in that!
(The flame on the gas lamps flickers and grows taller.)
BELLA. The lamps! He is coming back! He is finished upstairs!
SERGEANT ROUGH. There is the warning we’ve been waiting for. Ring for Elizabeth at once.
(SERGEANT ROUGH puts away his keys and tools, as –)
(BELLA pulls the bell cord, saying:)
BELLA. Jack will be here any moment.
(As ELIZABETH enters –)
SERGEANT ROUGH. Elizabeth: are you willing to help your mistress? Help her blindly – while asking no questions whatsoever?
ELIZABETH. Yes, sir. I am.
SERGEANT ROUGH. Good. Then, tell me this: if you were asked to hide an old police detective in your home, where would you put him?
BELLA. But you can’t hide in the house! – Jack will find you!
ELIZABETH. (Turning to the closet.) How about the Master’s wardrobe?
BELLA. But Jack uses that closet every night!
SERGEANT ROUGH. (To ELIZABETH.) Show it to me, at once.
(ELIZABETH takes SERGEANT ROUGH to the wardrobe/closet.)
ELIZABETH. It’s right here – through this door – it’s quite large. Goes all the way back.
(SERGEANT ROUGH disappears into the closet.)
BELLA. Elizabeth – this can’t be happening! I must be dreaming it.
ELIZABETH. Be strong, Ma’am. Listen to him, and do what he says –
(SERGEANT ROUGH emerges from the closet.)
SERGEANT ROUGH. Perfect accommodation!
(SERGEANT ROUGH puts his jacket back on.)
Now: we must remove all evidence of my presence. I shall get my coat and scarf. Do not forget our whiskey glasses –
BELLA. You must hide if you’re going to hide –
SERGEANT ROUGH. And my teacup, as well.
(ELIZABETH gathers up the glasses, as well as Sergeant Rough’s teacup, as –)
(SERGEANT ROUGH is peeking out a window.)
Ah, yes. Here he comes! Right on time.
(To BELLA.) You, Mrs. Manningham, must go upstairs this instant.
(To ELIZABETH.) Elizabeth, you must invent something to tell your master.
BELLA. (Suddenly, to ELIZABETH.) Tell him I had a headache and retired to my bed.
SERGEANT ROUGH. Yes! That’s perfect! And do not leave your room until I call for you. That is very important.
(To ELIZABETH.) Now – let’s turn down those lamps.
(ELIZABETH does so.)
BELLA. But then what, Sergeant Rough? What is your plan?
SERGEANT ROUGH. There is no more plan! I’ve told you everything I know!
BELLA. That’s not enough!
SERGEANT ROUGH. It will have to be! (With force.) You are up against the most awful moment of your life – and you must be STRONG. Your entire future depends on what we do here in the next hour!
(BELLA stares at him, hard.)
BELLA. (Exacting a promise.) I am trusting you, Sergeant Rough.
(SERGEANT ROUGH nods.)
Hurry, Elizabeth. My husband is about to walk through that door.
(BELLA and ELIZABETH vanish up the stairs.)
(SERGEANT ROUGH tiptoes to the door of the room and listens for a moment.)
(A light in the hallway goes on [perhaps the silhouette of JACK is seen], and –)
(SERGEANT ROUGH tiptoes away, grabbing his overcoat and scarf – and heading quickly to the closet.)
(At the very moment SERGEANT ROUGH is about to vanish into the closet and shut the door, he reaches for the hat atop his head… but it is not there! He looks and sees: his hat sitting atop Jack’s desk, across the room.)
(As SERGEANT ROUGH steps out of the closet to fetch the hat –)
(JACK enters the room, and –)
(SERGEANT ROUGH pops back into the closet.)
(JACK leisurely moves to the lamp[s] and brightens the room. He pulls the bell cord. He removes his overcoat and hat. He stands very near to Sergeant Rough’s hat, with his back to it – as he checks his pocket watch.)
(Impatient now, JACK steps back out into the hallway, calling –)
JACK. Nancy! Elizabeth! – Where are you? Can you hear me?
(– And during this very brief moment:)
(SERGEANT ROUGH opens the closet door – tiptoes fully across the room – and retrieves his own hat.)
(Heading back to the closet, SERGEANT ROUGH grabs one more lump of sugar from the bowl and pops it in his mouth, as –)
(From the hallway, JACK steps back into the room, saying:)
Is no one here?!
(Just as, in the nick of time –)
(SERGEANT ROUGH vanishes into the closet, closing the door behind him quickly, as –)
(Lights rush to black.)


End of Act One


ACT TWO

Scene One

(The Manningham Home. 6 PM.)
(The very last moment of Act One is replayed:)
(From the hallway, JACK steps back into the room, saying:)
JACK. Is no one here?!
(Just as, in the nick of time –)
(SERGEANT ROUGH vanishes into the closet, closing the door behind him quickly, as –)
(ELIZABETH appears, coming quickly down the stairs.)
ELIZABETH. Sir?
JACK. Elizabeth – there you are. I rang the bell.
ELIZABETH. I was seeing to Mrs. Manningham. She’s gone to bed with a terrible headache.
JACK. Is that so?
ELIZABETH. Yes, sir.
JACK. (A coy whisper.) Then we will need to be quiet as cats. Can you do that, Elizabeth? Can you sneak about as quietly as a cat?


43 
ELIZABETH. (Trying to smile/whisper.) Well – I’m not sure, really.
JACK. (Still playing.) Perhaps a little kitty-cat should have already cleared away our tea.
ELIZABETH. Oh, I was just about to do that, sir.
(ELIZABETH moves to the tea service.)
What would you like for supper?
JACK. I will have my supper out tonight. I’ve only come home to change my collar.
(ELIZABETH looks immediately at the closet, as –)
(JACK takes off his jacket. He begins undoing his collar.)
ELIZABETH. Should I get you a fresh one, sir? From your closet.
JACK. (Lightly.) I think I am capable of doing that.
ELIZABETH. But it would be my pleasure! Why don’t you sit for a minute and I will –
JACK. (Teasing her.) Do you know the sort of collar I want to wear tonight?
ELIZABETH. Why, yes – I think I do!
JACK. You are a mind-reader then! I shall have to watch myself around you.
(ELIZABETH watches in horror, as:)
(JACK opens the door to the closet and walks inside.)
(Nearly fifteen seconds go by as ELIZABETH stands frozen, fretting, staring at the closet, while…not a sound is heard. Finally:)
(JACK reappears, in a leisurely way, wearing a fresh collar, and carrying a colorful necktie.)
There we are.
(Off her look.) Is something wrong?
ELIZABETH. Oh, no, sir. Not at all.
(ELIZABETH quickly closes the closet door, which JACK has left open.)
JACK. Tell me, Elizabeth: what did you think of Mrs.
Manningham tonight?
ELIZABETH. She seemed…unwell.
JACK. I doubt you can imagine how unwell she truly is. Just between us: I’m at my wit’s end. I’ve tried kindness, patience, cunning – even harshness, at times, to bring her to her senses. But I’m afraid this malady runs in her family. Her mother died in the madhouse, you know.
(JACK looks down at the colorful necktie in his hand.)
What do you think of this necktie?
ELIZABETH. Oh – well – it’s –
JACK. I think it is all wrong.
(JACK turns toward the closet, as –)
ELIZABETH. (Quickly.) No – it’s perfect, sir – you don’t need another!
(But JACK has already strolled into the closet once again, as –)
(ELIZABETH stands nearby, once again, holding her breath. Perhaps trying to peek into the keyhole of the door.)
(Another very long moment passes, and then –)
(JACK reappears, happily holding a new [less colorful] necktie.)
JACK. Much better.
(Leaving the closet door open, JACK goes to a small mirror across the room. He begins to tie his necktie. JACK’s back is to the closet throughout what follows.)
(ELIZABETH goes to close the closet door again, but jumps when –)
(SERGEANT ROUGH appears quickly in the closet doorway, holding his finger to his lips for quiet.)
(SERGEANT ROUGH gestures for ELIZABETH
to bring him Jack’s jacket.)
(Turned away.) The doctors will be coming to the house tomorrow morning, to examine our dear Bella. I’ve fought the idea as long as possible, but now there is no avoiding it. Don’t you agree?
(ELIZABETH brings SERGEANT ROUGH the
jacket.)
ELIZABETH. Oh, yes, sir –
(SERGEANT ROUGH checks the pockets of the jacket, finding nothing –)
JACK. And you will be expected to testify. You will be asked to tell the doctors what you have observed in this home.
(SERGEANT ROUGH hands the jacket to
ELIZABETH and closes the closet door –)
Can I count on you for that?
(JACK turns to her. ELIZABETH is caught holding his jacket.)
ELIZABETH. I will help in any way I can.
JACK. Why are you holding my jacket?
(ELIZABETH lifts the jacket, readying it for him to wear.)
ELIZABETH. Just making it ready for you, sir. Here we are.
(JACK smiles and steps forward. ELIZABETH
helps him into the jacket.)
JACK. You know, Elizabeth: at times you remind me of my mother. She was completely loyal to my father. As you are to me. I greatly admire that.
(ELIZABETH looks JACK squarely in the eyes.)
ELIZABETH. Always loyal to you, sir.
(JACK picks up his hat and overcoat.)
JACK. I’m going out to have my supper now. And after that, I might visit a club or two. Do you think that’s wrong?
ELIZABETH. Sir?
JACK. With my wife feeling ill, do you think it’s wrong of me to do that?
ELIZABETH. What I think, sir: is that you should get all the pleasure you can…while you can.
JACK. (Smiles.) Words to live by. Good night, Elizabeth.
(JACK leaves.)
(ELIZABETH watches him go, then closes the door behind him, as –)
(SERGEANT ROUGH appears from the closet. He is holding his tool kit.)
(SERGEANT ROUGH has replaced his own necktie with the colorful necktie that JACK discarded.)
SERGEANT ROUGH. Well done, Elizabeth. Now, let’s return to our work.
(SERGEANT ROUGH removes his jacket once again, as –)
(BELLA comes down the stairs, quickly.) BELLA. What did Jack want? Why did he come back? SERGEANT ROUGH. Only for a change of clothes.
BELLA. (Seeing SERGEANT ROUGH’s necktie.) Wait – that
tie you’re wearing belongs to Jack!
SERGEANT ROUGH. Yes – and I rather fancy it! Goes nicely with my saucy shirt!
(SERGEANT ROUGH carries his tool kit to the desk, once again.)
All right – let’s have another look at this bugger. BELLA. But what if he comes home and catches us? SERGEANT ROUGH. It’s the risk we’ve got to take.
(To ELIZABETH.) Keep watch at the window, Elizabeth.
(ELIZABETH nods and stations herself near the window, as –)
(SERGEANT ROUGH works on the lock with a series of tools.)
BELLA. We should not be doing this…
SERGEANT ROUGH. The drawer is more stubborn than I expected. We are going to have to force it.
(SERGEANT ROUGH heads toward the fireplace.)
BELLA. Did you hear me? Jack will know we’ve gone through his things.
(SERGEANT ROUGH lifts a serious metal poker.)
SERGEANT ROUGH. (Exasperated.) Yes, Mrs. Manningham! This is the point of no return! We must force this lock and gamble on finding something.
BELLA. But, what will I tell him when he discovers that –
SERGEANT ROUGH. (Strong.) I’ve no idea what you will tell him! Just as I’ve no idea what you will tell the doctors at the asylum when your husband orders you strapped to a bed for the rest of your life! Is that what you want?!
(SERGEANT ROUGH lifts the poker.)
Now: do we give up? Or do we gamble?
(A beat. BELLA stares at him.)
BELLA. Force it.


BELLA. Force it now!
(SERGEANT ROUGH readies the poker near the lock.)
SERGEANT ROUGH. Here we go –
BELLA. But be quick about it –
(SERGEANT ROUGH uses the poker to pry open the drawer in the desk, and –)
(A loud splintering sound is heard.)
SERGEANT ROUGH. Well. That splintered quite badly.
Let’s hope our gamble has paid off.
(SERGEANT ROUGH begins to go through the items in the drawer, as –)
(BELLA looks over his shoulder.)
It’s papers we are looking for. Anything that will tie him to the name “Sydney Power.”
BELLA. (Looking in the drawer.) That key there. That’s mine! He accused me of losing it.
SERGEANT ROUGH. All part of his game.
BELLA. And that watch. Those bracelets. They are mine, as well!
SERGEANT ROUGH. Yes – but we are looking for documents – identification –
BELLA. I didn’t lose them after all. It was him! He’s been hiding my things away!
SERGEANT ROUGH. (Impatient.) Please, Mrs. Manningham – you must allow me to do my work!
(BELLA reaches past SERGEANT ROUGH and removes a rather large brooch.)
BELLA. And this! This is my brooch. It was a gift from Jack.
SERGEANT ROUGH. We are looking for more than trinkets –
BELLA. It’s been missing for years. ages.
SERGEANT ROUGH. – Aha! – Here are papers! – Deeper in the drawer…
(SERGEANT ROUGH pulls out a handful of papers.)
BELLA. Is there a grocery bill there?
SERGEANT ROUGH. A what?
BELLA. He accused me tonight of hiding the grocery bill.
SERGEANT ROUGH. I see nothing of the kind. Only some personal letters, and –
BELLA. Letters?
SERGEANT ROUGH. Yes –
(BELLA grabs the bundle of letters from
SERGEANT ROUGH.)
BELLA. They are all addressed to me!
SERGEANT ROUGH. I remind you we are looking for the name “Sydney Power” –
(BELLA is opening one of the letters, as –)
              ELIZABETH. But who are they from? 
(ELIZABETH moves in closer.)
BELLA. They are letters from my cousins. My aunts and uncles, as well!
SERGEANT ROUGH. There will be time to read your family correspondence later –
BELLA. I wrote to them every day – and I never heard back. Jack said they resented my inheritance. But Elizabeth – listen to this:
(From a letter.) “Dear Bella, we were overjoyed to hear from you! We hope you’ll come back for a visit very soon!”
(SERGEANT ROUGH is quickly browsing through more papers, folders, etc.)
SERGEANT ROUGH. There’s no proof here at all –
BELLA. They wanted to see me – but Jack hid their letters away!
SERGEANT ROUGH. Nothing that identifies your husband as Sydney Power. We have lost our gamble, I’m afraid.
(Moving away, urgent.) The window, Elizabeth!
ELIZABETH. Yes, sir.
(ELIZABETH returns to the window.)
SERGEANT ROUGH. (To BELLA.) You and I will put things back as best we can. I’ll need your letters – quickly – all of them.
BELLA. No – please – I cherish them –
SERGEANT ROUGH. You are the one who said we must leave no sign of our intrusion. The letters, please.
(BELLA reluctantly hands SERGEANT ROUGH the bundle of letters. He restores them to their place in the drawer.)
There we are. And last, your brooch –
(BELLA hands him the brooch.)
(As SERGEANT ROUGH begins to put it inside the drawer, he stops for a moment.)
It is a nice trinket, all right. When did he give you this?
BELLA. Soon after we were married. Even though I knew it was second-hand, I loved to wear it.
(SERGEANT ROUGH puts the brooch away inside the drawer.)
SERGEANT ROUGH. There we are. We have covered our tracks, for now –
(SERGEANT ROUGH closes the drawer, with some effort.)
– though I’m afraid our drawer is a bit worse for wear.
(SERGEANT ROUGH lifts the fireplace poker, and moves away from the desk.)
Here, Elizabeth. This can be put back where it belongs.
(ELIZABETH comes to take the poker from
SERGEANT ROUGH – however –)
(SERGEANT ROUGH does not let go of it. He holds the poker tight, looking front, his eyes transfixed.)
ELIZABETH. What is it, sir?
(No response from SERGEANT ROUGH.) BELLA. Sergeant Rough?
(SERGEANT ROUGH turns to BELLA.)
SERGEANT ROUGH. Your brooch. How did you know it was second-hand?
BELLA. Oh – there’s an inscription inside. Just a few words…intended for someone other than me.
(SERGEANT ROUGH re-opens the drawer.)
SERGEANT ROUGH. Can you show me?
(BELLA removes the brooch.)
BELLA. I was a bit heartsick, at first – to learn it was second-hand – but I liked the brooch so much that I said nothing.
(BELLA hands the brooch to SERGEANT ROUGH.)
SERGEANT ROUGH. The inscription you mentioned – where is it?
BELLA. (Instructing him.) It’s sort of a trick. I only discovered it by accident. There’s a little pin in back.
SERGEANT ROUGH. Oh, I see it…
BELLA. You pull it gently toward the right. And that reveals a little hinge…
SERGEANT ROUGH. Yes, look at that…
BELLA. …and that hinge allows it to open out, like a star.
SERGEANT ROUGH. So it does…
BELLA. The inscription is hidden inside. It’s very small.
(SERGEANT ROUGH takes a jeweler’s glass from his pocket and inspects the brooch.)
SERGEANT ROUGH.	(Reading.) “From your adoring husband. To my beloved A. B.”
(Considers, looks further.) And these empty spaces here…what do they mean?
BELLA. Oh, there used to be beads in there.
SERGEANT ROUGH. Beads?
BELLA. Yes – but they kept falling out. Eventually I removed them all. No one could see them, anyway.
SERGEANT ROUGH. And these beads…did you hold onto them by any chance?
BELLA. I put them in an old vase on the mantle. I never let them be disturbed.
ELIZABETH. Here they are!
(ELIZABETH retrieves the vase, and tips the contents into SERGEANT ROUGH’s hand.)
SERGEANT ROUGH. There should be nine of them, total.
Judging by the spaces in the brooch.
BELLA. I know they are only beads –
(SERGEANT ROUGH lines them up, side-by-side, on a surface. Looks at them with a jeweler’s glass.)
– but I thought they were so pretty. I meant to have them restored, but then the brooch went missing.
(A beat. SERGEANT ROUGH leans back, puts his jeweler’s glass away.)
SERGEANT ROUGH. (Grandly.) Mrs. Manningham – I must ask you something. Have you ever been embraced by an old police detective in his shirtsleeves?
BELLA. Well – no –
SERGEANT ROUGH. I should warn you: it is about to happen! The Barlow rubies have been found! Each and every one of them!
(SERGEANT ROUGH embraces BELLA. He embraces ELIZABETH. He spins them both. He dances with glee.)


SERGEANT ROUGH. Yes – that is the beauty of it!
ELIZABETH. They were in that old vase the whole time!
SERGEANT ROUGH. That is the cunning of our beloved “A. B.”!
BELLA. Alice Barlow!
SERGEANT ROUGH. She hid the rubies inside a common trinket she wore every day of her life.
BELLA. But what made you remember?
SERGEANT ROUGH. When I was first on the case, I studied portraits of her. In each portrait she was wearing that brooch. Twenty-five years later, I still remembered that. Oh, am I not a wonderful man!
(SERGEANT ROUGH dances again.)
ELIZABETH. (To BELLA.) And you’ve had her brooch the whole time!
SERGEANT ROUGH. Given to you second-hand, because Sydney Power could not resist a little common theft while he hunted the big game. Well, it is I who am after the big game now!
(SERGEANT ROUGH is quickly packing up his tools and putting on his jacket.)
BELLA. Are you leaving?
SERGEANT ROUGH. Indeed I am!
BELLA. But why?
SERGEANT ROUGH. Because I am going to move Heaven and Earth! And I am going to do it tonight, if I can. I shall need my coat and hat, Elizabeth.
ELIZABETH. Right away, sir.
(ELIZABETH goes to the closet.)
BELLA. But where are you going?!
SERGEANT ROUGH. To see the Chief of Police! He said I must have new evidence to reopen this case. Well, look at the treasure trove we have found tonight!
(SERGEANT ROUGH puts the rubies inside a small leather pouch.)
The Barlow rubies will be safe with me. The brooch must be returned to its hiding spot. Exactly where we found it.
(BELLA returns the brooch to the desk drawer.)
Very good.
(SERGEANT ROUGH takes his coat and hat from ELIZABETH. Puts them on.)
Thank you, Elizabeth.
(To BELLA.) Now close the drawer, Mrs. Manningham.
(But BELLA does not move. She seems suddenly frozen with fear.)
Did you hear me?
(BELLA does not respond.)
You must close up the desk and go to your bed. Under no circumstances are you to come downstairs while I am gone.
(BELLA remains frozen, unresponsive.)
Mrs. Manningham! – Do you hear me?
(BELLA does not respond.)
ELIZABETH. (Worried.) Ma’am – what is it?
BELLA. I’ve just had a terrible feeling. That something awful will happen if you leave. I’m afraid I will lose my courage.
SERGEANT ROUGH. Your courage shall prove unshakable.
You must trust me on that.
(Lights rush out.)
Scene Two

(Later that night. 11 PM.)
(A clock is chiming the hour.)
(JACK enters from the hallway, leaving the door open behind him. He is humming a little tune to himself.)
(JACK pulls the bell cord. He is removing his hat and coat, as –)
(NANCY is seen in the hallway, walking past the door.)
JACK. Nancy? – Is that you? I can see you there in the hallway.
(NANCY peeks her head into the room. She wears a coat over her “outside” [non-maid] attire.)
Are you just now coming in?
NANCY. Yes. Just like you.
JACK. But do you know what time it is?
NANCY. After eleven, I think.
JACK. I’ve just rung the bell, Nancy – because I am home, and I would like my shortbread and brandy.
NANCY. Doesn’t your wife usually leave that for you?
JACK. She does – but I’m told she went to bed with a headache.
NANCY. Once again.
JACK. Tell me, Nancy: do you recall a time when Mrs.
Manningham did not go to bed with a headache?
NANCY. I do not.
JACK. I wonder if you’d be willing to attest to that fact.
NANCY. Would I kiss a Bible again, you mean?
JACK. Yes, exactly.
(NANCY stares at him.)
NANCY. Maybe I would.
(JACK reaches to hand his coat and hat to
NANCY, but –)
(NANCY has already turned and gone down the hallway.)
(JACK smiles. He moves into the room, humming once again. He puts his coat and hat away in the closet, as –)
(NANCY returns. She has taken her coat off. She is wearing a lovely and rather provocative dress underneath.)
(NANCY carries a tray. On the tray is a small plate of shortbread, a decanter of brandy, and two glasses.)
Shortbread and brandy. As you wished.
(NANCY sets the tray near JACK.)
You’re sure you don’t want more light?
JACK. I’m sure.
(JACK is looking NANCY up and down.)
NANCY. Well, sir. Have your nightly needs been met?
JACK. You know, Nancy…you are given a great deal of latitude in this house. Permission to come and go as you please. It’s something that will get noticed.
NANCY. I don’t care who notices.
JACK. But we must keep up appearances, you and I. Like serving me while you are out of uniform.
NANCY. Shall I go change, sir?
JACK. No. Don’t do that.
(He lifts a piece of shortbread and bites into it, deliciously. He looks at the brandy on the tray.)
You’ve brought two glasses. I will only need one.
(NANCY slowly reaches down in front of him, close to him…and removes the second glass.)
NANCY. My apologies.
(NANCY turns to leave. When she is nearly out of the room, JACK says:)
JACK. Where were you tonight?
NANCY. Out with friends.
JACK. You know, when you say “out with friends” I can’t help but think you were meeting a gentleman.
NANCY. No – nothing like that.
JACK. You weren’t seeing that young Mr. Booker?
NANCY. He’s not a gentleman. He’s just a boy – like all the rest of them. They make me laugh – they fill my time – but they don’t know what a woman wants.
JACK. But you’re only still a girl.
NANCY. Is that what you think?
(They consider one another from a distance – the room between them.)
JACK. Would you like some brandy?
(Beat.)
NANCY. Maybe I would.
(JACK pours NANCY a glass of brandy.)
JACK. That is a very fetching dress.
(JACK lifts his own glass to hers.)
Here is to keeping up appearances.
(They clink glasses and drink.)
NANCY. How were your oysters?
JACK. They were taken away before I could enjoy them.
You must try one sometime.
NANCY. Oh, I tried one.
(Beat.)
I liked it.
(NANCY is close to JACK now.)
It was like having a tongue in my mouth.
(JACK stares at her. NANCY does not back down.)
(JACK leans forward, slowly, to kiss her… but she puts her finger on his lips – stopping him.)
I bet you don’t kiss like a boy. I bet you kiss like a man. Am I right?
(NANCY now lowers her finger…and JACK leans in again, reaching for her now – but NANCY has already moved away.)
I wonder what you ask of all your girls. What you expect them to do.
JACK. (Lightly.) What are you saying?
NANCY. I know what I’d do for you.
JACK. Yes…and what is that?
NANCY. I’d keep your secrets. You’d like that, wouldn’t you?
JACK. What secrets are you talking about?!
NANCY. I know you, Jack! I know exactly where you go when you go out on the town.
JACK. (Amused.) Oh, is that so?
NANCY. I know about all your actresses and dancers – your nimble little debutantes –
JACK. You are deluded, Nancy!
NANCY. Am I? I know all about your double life. And I know you’ll do anything to not be found out. Especially by your wife.
(Points upstairs.)
It’s her money you’re living on, isn’t it?
JACK. For now. But that will change.
NANCY. What does that mean?
JACK. You know everything, Nancy! Yes – I go out and meet girls. That is my crime and you’ve found me out!
NANCY. That is not your crime.
JACK. (With a laugh.) Oh, really? Then what is?
NANCY. You are driving her mad. I’ve watched you do it.
(JACK stares, hard now, at NANCY.)
But when the doctors arrive tomorrow morning…you will expect me to say otherwise. Won’t you, Jack?
(Beat.)
JACK. Yes. Yes, I will.
(NANCY touches JACK’s face. He seems to freeze at the touch.)
NANCY. It will cost you.
(NANCY moves away.)
JACK. (Firmly.) Please tell my wife that I must see her.
(NANCY walks up the stairs, as –)
(JACK removes a key ring from his pocket. As he is walking toward his desk…he stops when sees the damaged drawer for the first time. He opens the drawer, with effort. He stares at it, livid.)
(Seething.) Bella…
(JACK lifts the entire drawer out of its brackets and sets it atop the desk, as –)
(NANCY appears on the stairs.)
NANCY. She won’t leave her room. Says she’s not feeling well.
JACK. I told you to bring her down here!
NANCY. The door is locked. She must know your plan.
JACK. Quiet! – Let me think –
(JACK has lifted Bella’s bundle of personal letters from the drawer. He holds the letters, looking at them. He has an idea.)
NANCY. Are those her letters?
(JACK grabs paper and pen. He begins to write a note, as –)
(NANCY looks more closely at the drawer.)
NANCY. Look at that. All the little things you steal from her. You hide them in that drawer. And she never suspects.
(JACK puts the note inside an envelope. He hands this envelope to NANCY.)
JACK. Take this note to my wife. Slip it under the door.
NANCY. But what is it? What are you doing?
JACK. We are smoking her out, Nancy. Now, hurry –
NANCY. Don’t forget: I know your secrets.
(NANCY goes up the stairs, as –)
(JACK looks at the bundle of letters once again. Then, he walks to the fireplace, and without a second thought –)
(JACK tosses the letters in the fire. They burn instantly.)
(JACK now places a single chair, facing the fireplace, as though he were staging a ceremony.)
(JACK stares up at the portrait of his father for a moment, as –)
(BELLA appears on the stairs, holding the envelope.)
JACK. Good evening, Bella.
(BELLA says nothing.)
Come and sit.
(BELLA does not move.)
Elizabeth said you had a headache. Are you feeling better now?
(BELLA says nothing.)
Please join me. I have a chair for you.
BELLA. And letters. Your note said you have letters for me.
From my family.
JACK. Come down. I want to talk to you about something.
(BELLA considers the situation for a long moment…and then…)
(BELLA slowly descends the stairs.)
BELLA. Your note said I could read them. You said it would be a nice thing.
JACK. Your chair is there.
BELLA. Where are the letters, Jack? I want to see them, please. I want to hold them in my hand.
(BELLA has settled into a different chair – one closer to the door.)
JACK. Bella?
BELLA. Yes?
JACK. You are not sitting in the chair I indicated.
BELLA. Show me the letters.
JACK. There is something we must talk about first. To do that, you need to sit where I asked.
BELLA. My family didn’t want me to marry you. But I did…and I have…and here we are…
JACK. Why are you sitting over there? Are you afraid of me?
BELLA. I am not afraid of you. It’s the strangest thing. I am not afraid of you at all.
JACK. Then you have a great deal of courage.
BELLA. Yes. I’ve been told that.
JACK. Well. Since you are so courageous, won’t you sit where I’ve told you to sit?
BELLA. And then you’ll give me my letters?
JACK. Yes, of course.
(BELLA stares at him. She stands. And then, in complete silence…)
(BELLA crosses the room very slowly…and settles into the chair that JACK placed for her.)
Do you know what you remind me of, Bella? A sleepwalker. The way you move around this house in a daze – your body adrift, your mind wandering.
BELLA. My mind is not wandering. JACK. I was told you had gone to bed. BELLA. That’s true.
JACK. Then why are you still fully dressed?
(BELLA is silent. She looks down at her own clothing for a moment.)
BELLA. (The truth.) I don’t know. But I slept, Jack. I slept
so deeply. I have never slept like that before.
JACK. And you are radiant. Suddenly there is color in your cheeks. Like you’ve had some kind of excitement since I left.
BELLA. No. Nothing like that.
JACK. I asked you to find the grocery bill and place it on my desk. Did you do that?
BELLA. I did not.
JACK. Do you remember what I said would happen if you failed to do that? What the consequences would be?
BELLA. You said you would have me locked up.
JACK. And did you believe me?
BELLA. Yes.
JACK. Why?
BELLA. Because you have trained me to believe you.
(JACK moves away, toward the fireplace poker. He holds it at his side, saying:)
JACK. Did you open my desk?
(BELLA stands, fearful – moving away towards the door.)
BELLA. No – I would never do that. You know I don’t go near your desk.
JACK. Then how do you explain this?
(JACK stands near the exposed desk drawer.)
BELLA. Please, Jack –
JACK. Come and look. I want you to see what you’ve done.
BELLA. – I want to sleep again. I want to sleep like I did before.
JACK. Of course you do. BELLA. I’m tired, Jack. JACK. Yes, I know.
BELLA. I’m suddenly so tired.
JACK. (Persuasively.) Your mind is tired. So tired that it can no longer work at all. That’s what I wanted to talk to you about.
JACK. (Looking in her eyes.) It seems you no longer think, Bella. You only dream.
(This lands with her. BELLA stares at JACK… as an enormous fear begins to overtake her.)
You can’t help it – you are not aware of it – you have no power over it –
BELLA. No…
JACK. – but you dream incessantly. It seems you move about in your sleep, conspiring against me when I’m gone.
BELLA. No…
JACK. You have done it again tonight.
BELLA. I swear to you I haven’t…
JACK. In your nightly wandering, you have broken into my desk.
BELLA. (Her will is starting to give way.) You are saying I have dreamt it?
JACK. (With seeming empathy.) That is your pattern, Bella: you commit crimes against me…and then you claim to be unaware of them.
BELLA. I have dreamt all that has happened tonight?
JACK. “All that has happened?” What does that mean?
BELLA. I can’t have dreamt the whiskey and the saucy shirt –
JACK. The what?
BELLA. (Overlapping.) – the man who nabbed Sandham the Throttler –
JACK. You are making no sense –
BELLA. (In a panic now.) It can’t be true, Jack! Please tell me I have not dreamt it – not dreamt everything that happened tonight!
JACK. I must know, Bella! I must know what happened in this dream of yours.
(BELLA is desperately fighting an onrush of fear.)
BELLA. I dreamt –
(Stops.)
JACK. Yes? Go on.
BELLA. I can’t. It can’t have happened.
JACK. Try, Bella…
BELLA. I dreamt that a man…came here, to our house.
JACK. Who was it?
BELLA. Please let me go to my bed, Jack –
JACK. No – you must tell me this first! Who is this man you’re speaking of?!
(Unseen to them both, the door to the room slowly begins to open…)
BELLA. (Transfixed.) He had waited for you to be gone… then he came to speak to me. He stood right there by the door…
JACK. But what did he want?
BELLA. It was the strangest thing: he wanted to be kind to me. I dreamt he came here to help me…
(BELLA looks in the direction of the door, and –) (There stands SERGEANT ROUGH.)
SERGEANT ROUGH. (To BELLA, with a wink.) Was I, perhaps, the man of your dreams?
BELLA. Oh my…
JACK. Who are you? – Who let you in?!
SERGEANT ROUGH. I am a ghost. I can appear anywhere I wish.
JACK. What business do you have with us?
SERGEANT ROUGH. None at all – until my associates arrive.
I expect them momentarily.
(JACK stares at SERGEANT ROUGH. Then, he turns quickly to BELLA.)
JACK. Go to your room, Bella.
BELLA. But this man…
JACK. You wanted to sleep, remember? Do that. We will finish this later.
(BELLA looks at SERGEANT ROUGH. He nods.)
SERGEANT ROUGH. Sweet dreams…
(Staring at SERGEANT ROUGH, BELLA walks up the stairs and is gone.)
You won’t finish it later. It is finished already. JACK. Tell me your name and what you want. SERGEANT ROUGH. As a ghost I have no name – JACK. Listen to me –
SERGEANT ROUGH. – but I am able to hover over a house.
(JACK moves toward the door.)
JACK. I will call the police and have you thrown out of here.
SERGEANT ROUGH. The police! – What a good idea!
If only I’d thought of that.
(JACK turns, menacingly, toward SERGEANT ROUGH. JACK lifts the fireplace poker as a weapon now, as –)

(The gas lamps suddenly go lower.)
(A smile.) Look there: my friends have appeared. See the light – the way it dims.
JACK. That is only the gas in the lamps –
SERGEANT ROUGH. Oh, no – these are the ghostly spirits who have come to protect me. Eerie, isn’t it? Being in the dark.
(SERGEANT ROUGH begins circling slowly around JACK, as the lights continue to flicker and dim and grow – casting strange shadows around the room.)
I was in the dark about you for a long time, Mr. Manningham. But the Spirits of Justice have come to serve your reckoning.
JACK. Whoever you are, you’re making no sense –
SERGEANT ROUGH. I’m nothing but an old man seeing ghosts. And I see them everywhere – especially in this room. I see an old woman sitting in her chair. That chair – right where you stand.
(JACK immediately removes his hand from this chair –)
And I see another ghost. A young man. Well-bred, well-groomed – but he has murder in his eyes. In his hands, he holds a weapon.
(JACK immediately drops the fireplace poker to the ground –)
SERGEANT ROUGH. The old woman sees him – but it is too late! He cuts her throat to stop her screaming! And he stands there – this young man – this Sydney Power – he stands there with the blood of Alice Barlow on his hands. She lies dead on the floor.
(Points.) Right there!
(JACK stares with horror at the spot on which
he stands.)
Desperate now, he tears the house apart – looking for his hidden treasure – but he finds nothing. And twenty-five years later – he tries again –
JACK. (Suddenly.) No! – It’s not true!
SERGEANT ROUGH. – but JUSTICE has now found what HE never could find!
(SERGEANT ROUGH produces the small leather pouch which contains the rubies.)
The Barlow rubies! Hidden inside a simple trinket – one that you filched from this house years ago and pawned off on your wife as a gift.
JACK. That’s impossible…
SERGEANT ROUGH. You killed one woman for these rubies. You sought to drive another one mad. But your malevolence has gained you nothing but a date with your executioner!
JACK. You’ve got NO PROOF –
(JACK races for the door, just as –)
SERGEANT ROUGH. (Calling toward door.) COME ON IN, FELLAS.
(TWO POLICE OFFICERS rush into the room – batons at the ready –)
JACK. NO PROOF AT ALL!
(A struggle ensues, with the POLICE OFFICERS
subduing JACK.)
SERGEANT ROUGH. (To JACK.) As you can see: my associates have arrived.
JACK. (To SERGEANT ROUGH.) You fool! – You bastard!
(SERGEANT ROUGH walks up close to JACK, as the POLICE OFFICERS hold him.)
SERGEANT ROUGH. (Cups a hand to his ear.) I’m sorry.
Come again?
JACK. You dirty LIMEY BASTARD!
(SERGEANT ROUGH takes this opportunity to kick JACK very hard in the shins [or worse].)
(JACK falls to the ground, in pain. The
POLICE OFFICERS bind JACK with a rope.)
SERGEANT ROUGH. Sydney Reginald Power. You are charged in the murder of Mrs. Alice Barlow. Anything you say may be taken down in writing and used as evidence at your trial.
Come quietly, now. We needn’t wake your wife.
(The POLICE OFFICERS begin to take JACK
away, as –)
(BELLA appears on the stairs.)
BELLA. What has happened? – Why are the police here?
SERGEANT ROUGH. Our work is done. You needn’t see this man again.
SERGEANT ROUGH. (To the POLICEMEN.) Here we go,
fellas.
(The POLICE OFFICERS start off, with JACK.) BELLA. (Urgently.) But wait – I must speak to him.
SERGEANT ROUGH. There’s no need –
BELLA. I must tell him about my dream.
SERGEANT ROUGH. There will be another time for that –
BELLA. (Desperate.) But I need to speak to him now.
SERGEANT ROUGH. (Impatient.) Alright then – there he is: say what you need to say!
BELLA. I must speak to him alone.
(SERGEANT ROUGH stares at her.)
(Imploring.) Please…you can’t imagine how many things I need to say to him…
(This lands with SERGEANT ROUGH. He hesitates…but then, with some reluctance, says:)
SERGEANT ROUGH. Very well.
(To the POLICE OFFICER.) Tie him fast to that chair.
(The POLICE OFFICERS move JACK to a sturdy, straight-back chair. They tie the ropes around him to the chair.)
Tighter. Like this.
(SERGEANT ROUGH pulls the ropes much tighter.)
JACK. Aauaugh!
SERGEANT ROUGH. (To BELLA.) Three minutes. Not a moment more. We will be just outside the door.
BELLA. I don’t want you to listen.
SERGEANT ROUGH. (Nods.) You are on your own, Mrs.
Manningham.
(SERGEANT ROUGH exits, leaving the door open. The POLICE OFFICERS follow.)
(BELLA comes down the stairs…moves to the door…and very quietly and slowly…closes the door to the room.)
(BELLA stands behind JACK, unseen by him.)
JACK.  Bella… say something… are you there, Bella?
…I want to know you’re there…
(No response.)
(More desperately.) Bella, please – we haven’t much time…
(Still no response. And then…)
(JACK begins to sing the little pet song from earlier:)
…BELLA, BELLA…SMILE FOR YOUR FELLA…
(Hearing this song, BELLA slowly closes her eyes…speaks quietly.)
BELLA. We are here.
JACK.
BELLA…
BELLA. Together.
JACK.
…BELLA…
BELLA. In our home. And now I know the truth.
The truth is…it was all a dream.
(BELLA now opens her eyes and walks toward
JACK, in a worried state, her revery shattered –)
BELLA. What have they done to you, Jack?
JACK. It’s nothing – it’s all right –
BELLA. What has happened?
JACK. It was a dream, remember? – Nothing more! And you are so clever, my darling –
BELLA. Yes, but –
JACK. – You are such a clever girl! So smart to get them out of the room. Now, listen to me: I need something to cut the rope –
BELLA. But they are right outside the door –
JACK. If you free me, I can go upstairs and out the skylight on the upper floor –
BELLA. The rope is too strong –
JACK. There is a razor in my closet. It is in a wooden case.
BELLA. A razor – yes –
JACK. Hurry – on the shelf to the right –
BELLA. – Yes – I’ll get the razor, Jack – I’ll be quick –
(BELLA rushes to the closet, as –) (Knocking is heard at the door –)
VOICE OF SERGEANT ROUGH. MRS. MANNINGHAM?
EVERYTHING ALRIGHT?
BELLA. JUST ANOTHER MINUTE!
(BELLA has retrieved the razor case from the closet. She quickly brings the case to JACK.)
JACK. Good – yes – you shall save us both, Bella! – Now, open it and take out the razor –
(As BELLA takes out the razor: something else falls out of the case. It is an ordinary piece of paper. Without a second thought –)
(BELLA lifts the paper from ground.)
The razor, Bella…
(Suddenly, a warm smile fills BELLA’s face.) BELLA. Oh, my. It’s here, Jack! The grocery bill. I’ve found it! JACK. Yes, now –
BELLA. (Buoyant.) You see, my darling – I didn’t lose it
after all! I told you I didn’t lose the grocery bill!
JACK. Cut me loose, Bella –
(And now her countenance fully changes.
BELLA stares hard at JACK.)
You must hurry –
(BELLA stares at the grocery bill.)
Bella – what is it?
BELLA. How did the grocery bill get inside your razor case?
JACK. Bella, please – it’s nothing – BELLA. I have never opened this case. JACK. – It was my mistake –
BELLA. I never go in your closet.
JACK. – I must have forgot that I –
BELLA. I could not have put this bill in there. JACK. (Desperate.) – Bella, you must listen – BELLA. It was you. It was you all along.
JACK. No – Bella –
BELLA. It’s true, isn’t it?! Tell me the truth!
JACK. – The razor, Bella –
BELLA. I want the truth to be told in this home.
JACK. – Use the razor to free me!
(BELLA begins to circle him, holding the razor now as a weapon.)
BELLA. What razor, Jack? I see no razor. I think it’s just your “overactive imagination.”
JACK. Stop this, Bella – they are coming for me –
BELLA. –I think you may be going mad! JACK. – They will be back in a moment – BELLA. Oh, I know all about that!
JACK. Take the razor and cut the ropes!
BELLA. But I can’t FIND the razor, Jack! You know how I’m always LOSING THINGS.
(BELLA takes a swing at JACK’s head with the razor – and JACK recoils.)
Where could that RAZOR BE?!
(BELLA takes another swing at his head.)
JACK. BELLA – PLEASE –
(Pounding on the door is heard –)
BELLA. Could the razor be in your desk?!
(BELLA dumps the full contents of the desk drawer to the ground –)
NO – I DON’T SEE IT.
VOICE OF SERGEANT ROUGH.  MRS. MANNINGHAM?
BELLA. Maybe it is hidden in your chair?!
(BELLA stabs at the chair with the razor –)
NO – I CAN’T FIND IT. Maybe you keep it behind this painting –
(BELLA yanks the portrait down from the wall –)
Your beloved father – the one who raised you to be the man you are today!
(–And BELLA slashes the portrait, venomously, with the razor.)
JACK. NO! BELLA, STOP –
(Pounding on the door again –)
VOICE OF SERGEANT ROUGH. MRS. MANNINGHAM – IT’S TIME –
BELLA. I KNOW WHAT IT’S LIKE TO BE BOUND
WITH ROPES. In a room – in a house – in a marriage!
JACK. You must HELP ME, Bella!
BELLA. (Right in JACK’s face.) How can I help you?! I’m nothing but a perfect little silly, REMEMBER? Just a sleepwalking lunatic with a busy little mind!
(More pounding on the door –)
JACK. Bella, PLEASE –
BELLA. (Honestly, fiercely.) You were right, Jack: I have been driven mad. And here’s how I know: because I have failed to HATE YOU. I pitied and protected you. I believed you were my husband and my hopes and my future. And that is MADNESS, Jack. But it is changing. It is changing right this instant –
(BELLA throws the razor aside.)
BELLA. – because I am no longer dreaming. I have never been so awake in my own life!
(BELLA throws open the door to the room, saying –)
SERGEANT ROUGH! COME TAKE HIM AWAY!
(SERGEANT ROUGH enters immediately – followed by the POLICE OFFICERS. ELIZABETH and NANCY also enter the room.)
(BELLA staggers away, as –)
(The POLICE OFFICERS take hold of JACK, and –)
(ELIZABETH rushes to hold BELLA –)


SERGEANT ROUGH.  You are safe, Mrs. Manningham.
He will never trouble you again
(To the POLICEMEN.) Get him on his feet –
(The POLICE OFFICERS get JACK to his feet, still bound by the rope, as BELLA moves away from the others.)
He will be locked up, awaiting trial. But we may still need testimony. From you, Mrs. Manningham – and from the other women in the house.
JACK. They won’t tell you anything! These women are loyal to me. Aren’t you, Elizabeth?
ELIZABETH. You may count on me – Sergeant Rough. JACK. No – don’t believe her – she’s lying – ELIZABETH. (Ice, to JACK.) No one dare call me a liar.
(ELIZABETH spits at JACK’s feet.)
SERGEANT ROUGH. What about you, Nancy?
JACK. Yes, Nancy – tell them! You saw it all!
(Re: BELLA.) Tell them how she stole from me, hid my things away –
NANCY. You’re right, Jack. I saw it all.
JACK. Thank you.
NANCY. I watched you drive her mad.
JACK. NO –
SERGEANT ROUGH. You will testify against your master?
NANCY. He was never my master. He was just a man who And then he tried to kiss me –
JACK. Nancy – don’t do this –
NANCY. (Overlapping.) – Kiss me to shut me up – kiss me because I knew his secrets – because I’d watched him hide things from his wife.
JACK. Don’t listen to her. She’s deluded!
NANCY. Am I, Jack? Am I deluded? Just like your wife and Elizabeth and all the girls downtown? How does that work, Jack?! How can we ALL be so deluded?
JACK. You foolish little –
NANCY. Sergeant Rough: it would be my pleasure to watch him hang.
JACK. (To SERGEANT ROUGH.) You’ve got nothing on me!
SERGEANT ROUGH. Quiet!
JACK. Nothing but trinkets. Not a shred of evidence that ties me to Sydney Power!
BELLA. That portrait, Sergeant Rough…on the back of it there is a name stenciled. I had always thought it was the name of the artist…
(SERGEANT ROUGH goes to the slashed portrait and looks at the back of it.)
…but now I understand: it is the name of the painting’s subject.
SERGEANT ROUGH. (Reads from the painting.) “Reginald Power.”
(Looking at JACK.) Father of Sydney Reginald Power. (SERGEANT ROUGH nods, smiles at BELLA.)
There is our proof.
BELLA. (Desperate to know.) But the letters from my family? They are not in the drawer.
JACK. I’ve hidden your letters, Bella. You’ll need to tear this house apart to find them.
SERGEANT ROUGH. (To the POLICEMAN.) Get him out of here.
(The POLICE OFFICERS haul JACK out the door, as he exclaims:)
JACK. You’ll be sorry, Bella!


JACK. YOU WILL NEVER FORGET ME!
(They are gone. ELIZABETH follows them off.) (A sudden quiet settles on the room.)
SERGEANT ROUGH. Let me get you a chair.
(SERGEANT ROUGH brings BELLA a chair, but –)
(BELLA walks right past him…and settles into Jack’s upholstered chair, instead.)
BELLA. Jack’s right, isn’t he? That he won’t go away. SERGEANT ROUGH. (With empathy.) Not easily, no. BELLA. He will always be here…haunting this house… SERGEANT ROUGH. Nancy – we will need something from
my coat in the hallway. And two glass tumblers, as well.
NANCY. Right away, sir.
(NANCY nods, and leaves.)
(It is quiet for a long moment.)
SERGEANT ROUGH. I am sorry, you know. I fear I have put you through the worst night imaginable.
(BELLA looks SERGEANT ROUGH in the eyes. Then, she looks around the room.)
BELLA. I won’t remember it that way.
I believe I will remember it as the first night of my life.
(Lights fade away.)
