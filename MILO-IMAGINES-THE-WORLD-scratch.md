I think I lost her!

I hate her. I hate her. I hate her.

## A SCARY STRANGE ADULT:
Hey kid! 

---

## MILO:
Uh…hello. 

---

## A SCARY STRANGE ADULT:
Are you lost? 

---

## MILO:
Uh…no! No, I’m alright–I’m great–I’m fine–waiting for my sister. 

---

## A SCARY STRANGE ADULT:
Okay. 
      

---

## MILO:
I know exactly where I am! 

---

## A SCARY STRANGE ADULT:
Alright. 

---

## MILO:
I’m not lost! 

---

## A SCARY STRANGE ADULT:
Okaaaaay. 

---

## ANOTHER SCARY STRANGE ADULT:
Hey! Do you need help? 

---

## MILO:
No! No. I’m fine! Not lost. I totally know where I am. To-ta-lly. Not lost at all. 

---

## ANOTHER SCARY STRANGE ADULT:
Are you sure? 

---

## MILO:
Yes! 
No… 

Adrienne? RiRi? 
The ants are back. 

      
Maybe RiRi was right. It is stupid. 
She’s probably happy I'm gone. I bet she ain’t even looking for me. 

Whatever? 
I can take care of myself. I don’t need her. 

---

## ADRIENNE:
MILO!
Don’t ever run away from me like that again! Do you hear me? 

---


You hear me? 
You scared me half to death! I almost had a heart attack! 

---


A heart attack! 
Anything could have happened to you! What if you had gotten on the wrong train or gotten hurt or–or– 

---


I never could have forgiven myself– 
Milo? 

---

## ADRIENNE:
Are you listening to me? 
Oh so it’s like that? 

---


You’re just gonna hide from me forever? 

---


Milo? 

---


I know you’re behind there. I can see your foot sticking out. 

---

## MILO:
No you don’t. 

---

## ADRIENNE:

This was one of my best drawings.

## MILO:
And you ruined it… 
Look. 
Look. 

---

## MILO:
Can you see who she is? 

---

## MILO:
Can you see? 
I’ll give you a hint: 

---


She is a superhero! 
So strong and so beautiful 

---


      
The most beautifulest, strongest person in the world. 
And she tells the best bedtime stories and gives the tightest hugs 

---


And whenever things are tough she is always there to make them better. Do you get it?? Can you tell who it is? 

---

## ADRIENNE:
(Overlapping) Is it me!?


---

## MILO:
(Overlapping)
It’s mom! 

---

## ADRIENNE:
Oh.

## MILO:
Supermom!

## ADRIENNE:
Okay. Remember to take everything out of your pockets when you go through the metal detectors. 

---

## ADRIENNE:
And don’t be acting up in here, alright? 

---

## MILO:
Not making any promises. 

---

## ADRIENNE:
Boy! Don’t make me take you home. 

---

## ADRIENNE:
Alright, get in line.    

---

## ADRIENNE:
Sit still.

## MILO:
Ugh! 


---

## A VOICE OVER THE SPEAKER:
Visiting hours for the final group will begin in 5 minutes. 
(a loud buzz, heavy metal doors shut)

## MILO:

Wait. Is that… 
That’s the king!! Could he actually be visiting someone here too? Just like me?

## MILO:
Maybe he doesn’t really live in a giant castle with a perfect life like I thought. Maybe his life is as weird and scary and special as mine. 
And if I was wrong about that, what else could I have been wrong about? Maybe the man crying on the train wasn’t crying at all? Maybe he just had allergies! 

---

## DEBBIE DOWNER GUY:

## MILO:
And maybe the breakdancer is a Broadway superstar who only dances on the train for fun.

And maybe the doorman is a huge fan! 

---

## DOORMAN:
Can-can-can-can I have your autograph? 

---

## MILO:
Maybe… 
Maybe you can’t tell what people are going through just by looking at them.

---

## MOM:
Milo!! 

---

## MILO:
Mom! 

---

## MOM:
      
Hey baby! 

---

## MILO:
I’m not a baby. 

---

## MOM:
Yes you are. You’re a baby to me. 
Get over here RiRi. You’re my baby too. 

---

## ADRIENNE:
Oh uh uh. 

---

## MOM:
I’ve missed you two so much. Too much. 

---

## MILO:
We missed you more! 

---

## MOM:
I don’t think so. 

---

## MILO:
Way more! 

---

## MOM:
Nope! Impossible! 

And, come here! Have you gotten taller since last week? 

---

## MILO:
I hope so! 

---

## MOM:
No, don’t tell me that. Just stop! 

---

## MILO:
Stop what? 

---

## MOM:
Stop growing! Stay my little Milo forever! 

---

## MOM:
And how are things with you RiRi? 

---

## ADRIENNE:
Fine. 

---

## MOM:
School going okay? 

---

## ADRIENNE:
Mmmhm. 

---

## MOM:
You and Milo been getting along? 

---

## MILO:
No! 

---

## ADRIENNE:
He’s annoying! 

---

## MILO:
She’s mean! 

---

## MOM:
Look, you are both under a lot of stress right now but you have to listen to each other. 

---

## MILO:
Why do I have to listen to her? She’s always fussing and yelling at me– 

---

## ADRIENNE:
He’s a brat! Why would I listen to him? 

---

## MOM:
Because all you have is each other. 

---

## ADRIENNE:
I’ve been dealing with this all day. 

---

## MOM:
I bet you have! Come here Ri. 

---

## MOM:
Thank you. 

---

## ADRIENNE:
For what? 

---

## MOM:
For holding our family together. 

The only reason I’m able to survive in here is ‘cause I know you’re at home taking care of things. 

So thank you for having my back. 

---

## MOM:
What are you imagining now? 

---

## MILO:
It’s a surprise! 

---

## MOM:
Oh, a surprise? 

---

## MILO:
Yep. A surprise for you. 

---

## ADRIENNE:
A new Supermom picture? 

---

## MILO:
Mmmmhmm. And it’s even better than the last one! 

---

## MILO:
No peeking! 

---

## MOM:
Okay Okay!! 

---

## MILO:
I’m almost done! Never disturb an artist at work! 

---

## MILO:
VOILA!

---

## MOM:
Milo, It’s perfect. 

---

## MILO:
You like it? 

---

## MOM:
No. I love it! 

---

## MILO:
This is me in the middle with the cool glasses. That’s Adrienne there in the pink and that’s you. And we’re eating ice cream on a Sunday afternoon. 

---

## MOM:
It’s beautiful. 

---

## ADRIENNE:
Wait, where is Supermom? Shouldn’t she be somewhere in her fancy hero suit saving the day? 

---

## MILO:
I thought this was better. 

---

## POLICE OFFICER:
3 minutes left of the visiting hour. 
      

---

## ADRIENNE:
What are you doing? 

---

## MOM:
I’m sitting on the porch eating a chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream cone, duh! What are you doing? 

---

## MILO:
Ooo Ooo I’m eating strawberry! 

---

## ADRIENNE:
But I wanted strawberry! 

---

## MILO:
Well too bad. I got it first! 

---

## ADRIENNE:
I’m the oldest! 

---

## MILO:
Well I’m the cutest. 

---

## MOM:
He is pretty adorable… 

---

## ADRIENNE:
MOM!

---

## MOM:
Just saying. 

---

## ADRIENNE:
Fine, fine, I'll have chocolate. 

---

## MILO:
Boring. 
      

---

## ADRIENNE:
(fake insulted) 
How dare you? Chocolate is not boring. It’s sophisticated. 

---

## MILO:
I can’t wait ‘til we can do this for real. 

---

## ADRIENNE:
With real ice cream. 

---

## MOM:
And with a real breeze. 

---

## POLICE OFFICER:
One minute until the end of visiting hours. 

---

## MOM:
Alright babies… 

---

## MILO:
I don’t want to go. 

---

## ADRIENNE:
We’ll be back next week. 

---

## MOM:
Make sure you listen to your sister? 

---

## ADRIENNE:
You heard that? 

---

## MOM:
And Adrienne, be kind to your brother.

## MOM:
Yep!
