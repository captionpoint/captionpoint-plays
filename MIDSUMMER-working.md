A Midsummer Night's Dream <br>
by William Shakespeare <br>

---

## THESEUS:
Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour <br>
Draws on apace. Four happy days bring in <br>
Another moon; but O, methinks, how slow <br>
This old moon wanes! She lingers my desires, <br>

---

Like to a stepdame or a dowager <br>
Long withering out a young man's revenue.

---



## HIPPOLYTA:
Four days will quickly steep themselves in night, <br>
Four nights will quickly dream away the time; <br>
And then the moon, like to a silver bow <br>
Now bent in heaven, shall behold the night <br>
Of our solemnities.
---

## THESEUS:
Go, Philostrate, <br>
Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments; <br>
Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth, <br>
Turn melancholy forth to funerals. <br>
The pale companion is not for our pomp. <br>

---

Hippolyta, I wooed thee with my sword,<br>
And won thy love doing thee injuries;<br>
But I will wed thee in another key, <br>
With pomp, with triumph, and with revelling

---

## EGEUS:
Happy be Theseus, our renowned duke. 

<br>

## THESEUS:
Thanks, good Egeus. What's the news with thee? 

---

## EGEUS:
Full of vexation come I, with complaint <br>
Against my child, my daughter Hermia. <br>
Stand forth, Demetrius. My noble lord, <br>
This man hath my consent to marry her. <br>
Stand forth, Lysander. And my gracious duke,

---
This man hath bewitched the bosom of my child. <br>
Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes <br>
And interchanged love-tokens with my child; <br>
Thou hast, by moonlight, at her window sung, <br>
With faining voice, verses of feigning love, 

---
And stolen the impression of her fantasy; <br>
With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gauds, conceits, <br>
Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats (messengers <br>
Of strong prevailment in unhardened youth), <br>
With cunning hast thou filched my daughter's heart, <br>
---
Turned her obedience, which is due to me, <br>
To stubborn harshness. And, my gracious duke, <br>
Be it so she will not here before your grace <br>
Consent to marry with Demetrius, <br>
I beg the ancient privilege of Athens: <br>
---
As she is mine, I may dispose of her, <br>
Which shall be either to this gentleman, <br> 
Or to her death, according to our law <br>
Immediately provided in that case
---
## THESEUS:
What say you, Hermia? Be advised, fair maid. <br>
To you your father should be as a god, <br>
One that composed your beauties; yea, and one <br>
To whom you are but as a form in wax, <br>
By him imprinted, and within his power
---
To leave the figure, or disfigure it. <br>
Demetrius is a worthy gentleman. 
---
## HERMIA:
So is Lysander. <br>
I would my father looked but with my eyes.
---
## THESEUS:
Rather your eyes must with his judgement look. 
---
## HERMIA:
I do entreat your grace to pardon me. <br>
I know not by what power I am made bold, <br>
But I beseech your grace that I may know <br>
The worst that may befall me in this case <br>
If I refuse to wed Demetrius.
---
## THESEUS:
Either to die the death, or to abjure <br>
For ever the society of men. <br>
Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires, <br>
Whether, if you yield not to your father's choice, <br>
You can endure the livery of a nun, 
---
For aye to be in shady cloister mewed <br>
To live a barren sister all your life, <br>
Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon. 
---
## HERMIA:
So I will grow, so live, so die, my lord, <br>
Ere I will yield my virgin patent up <br>
Unto his lordship whose unwished yoke <br>
My soul consents not to give sovereignty. 
---
## THESEUS:
Take time to pause, and by the next new moon, <br>
The sealing day betwixt my love and me <br>
For everlasting bond of fellowship, <br>
Upon that day either prepare to die <br>
For disobedience to your father's will, 
---
Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would, <br>
Or on Diana's altar to protest, <br>
For aye, Austerity and single life <br>
---
## DEMETRIUS:
Relent, sweet Hermia; and Lysander, yield <br>
Thy crazed title to my certain right.
---
## LYSANDER:
You have her father's love, Demetrius. <br>
Let me have Hermia's: do you marry him. 
---
## EGEUS:
Scornful Lysander, true, he hath my love, <br>
And what is mine, my love shall render him; <br>
And she is mine, and all my right of her <br>
I do estate unto Demetrius.
---
## LYSANDER:
I am, my lord, as well derived as he, <br>
As well possessed; my love is more than his, <br>
My fortunes every way as fairly ranked <br>
(If not with vantage) as Demetrius'; <br>
And (which is more than all these boasts can be) 
---
I am belov'd of beauteous Hermia. <br>
Why should not I then prosecute my right? <br>
Demetrius, I'll avouch it to his head, <br>
Made love to Nedar's daughter Helena <br>
And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes, <br>
Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry <br>
Upon this spotted and inconstant man. 
---
## THESEUS:
I must confess that I have heard so much, <br>
And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof; <br>
But being over-full of self-affairs, <br>
My mind did lose it. But Demetrius, come, <br>
And come, Egeus; you shall go with me. 
---
I have some private schooling for you both. <br>
For you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself <br>
To fit your fancies to your father's will; <br>
Or else, the law of Athens yields you up <br>
To death, or to a vow of single life. <br>
---
Come, my Hippolyta. What cheer, my love? <br>
Demetrius and Egeus, go along. <br>
I must employ you in some business <br>
Against our nuptial, and confer with you <br>
Of something nearly that concerns yourselves <br>
---
## EGEUS: 
With duty and desire we follow you. <br>
Exeunt [ all but ] Lysander and Hermia <br> 
---
## LYSANDER:
How now, my love? Why is your cheek so pale? <br>
How chance the roses there do fade so fast? <br>
---
## HERMIA:
Belike for want of rain, which I could well <br>
Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes. <br>
---
## LYSANDER:
Ay me! for aught that I could ever read, <br>
Could ever hear by tale or history, <br>
The course of true love never did run smooth; <br>
But either it was different in blood– <br>
---
## HERMIA: 
O cross, too high to be enthralled to low! <br>
---
## LYSANDER:
Or else misgrafted in respect of years – <br>
---
## HERMIA:
O spite, too old to be engaged to young!<br>
---
## LYSANDER:
Or else it stood upon the choice of friends – <br>
---
## HERMIA:
O hell, to choose love by another’s eyes! <br>
---
## LYSANDER:
Or, if there were a sympathy in choice, <br>
War, death or sickness did lay siege to it, <br>
Making it momentany as a sound, <br>
Swift as a shadow, short as any dream, <br>
Brief as the lightning in the collied night <br>
---
hear me, Hermia.<br>
I have a widow aunt, a dowager,<br>
Of great revenue, and she hath no child. <br>
From Athens is her house remote seven leagues, <br>
And she respects me as her only son. <br>
---
There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee, <br>
And to that place the sharp Athenian law <br>
Cannot pursue us. If thou lov’st me, then <br>
Steal forth thy father’s house tomorrow night; <br>
And in the wood a league without the town, <br>
---
Where I did meet thee once with Helena <br>
To do observance to a morn of May, <br>
There will I stay for thee. <br>
---
## HERMIA:
My good Lysander,<br>
I swear to thee by Cupid’s strongest bow<br>
By his best arrow with the golden head,<br>
By the simplicity of Venus’ doves,<br>
By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,<br>
---
And by that fire which burned the Carthage queen<br>
When the false Trojan under sail was seen,<br>
By all the vows that ever <br>
more than ever women spoke), <br>
In that same place thou hast appointed me, <br>
---
Tomorrow truly will I meet with thee. <br>
---
## LYSANDER:
Keep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena. <br>
---
## HERMIA:
God speed, fair Helena. Whither away?<br>
---
## HELENA:
Call you me fair? That fair again unsay. <br>
Demetrius loves your fair: O happy fair! <br>
Your eyes are lodestars, and your tongue’s sweet air <br>
More tunable than lark to shepherd’s ear <br>
When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.<br> 
---
Sickness is catching; O, were favour so!<br>
Your words I catch, fair Hermia; ere I go,<br>
My ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye,<br>
My tongue should catch your tongue’s sweet melody.<br>
Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated, <br>
---
The rest I’ll give to be to you translated.<br>
O teach me how you look, and with what art<br>
You sway the motion of Demetrius’ heart.<br>
---
## HERMIA:
I frown upon him, yet he loves me still.<br>
---
## HELENA:
O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!<br>
---
## HERMIA:
I give him curses, yet he gives me love.<br>
---
## HELENA:
O that my prayers could such affection move!<br>
---
## HERMIA:
The more I hate, the more he follows me.<br>
---
## HELENA:
The more I love, the more he hateth me.<br>
---
## HERMIA:
His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.<br>
---
## HELENA:
None but your beauty. Would that fault were mine!<br>
---
## HERMIA:
Take comfort: he no more shall see my face.<br>
Lysander and myself will fly this place<br>
---
## LYSANDER:
Helen, to you our minds we will unfold.<br>
Tomorrow night, when Phoebe doth behold<br>
Her silver visage in the watery glass, <br>
Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass <br>
(A time that lovers' flights doth still conceal), <br>
---
Through Athens’ gates have we devised to steal. <br>
---
## HERMIA:
And in the wood, where often you and I<br>
Upon faint primrose beds were wont to lie<br>
Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,<br>
There my Lysander and myself shall meet,<br>
And thence from Athens turn away our eyes, <br>
---
To seek new friends and strange companies.<br>
Farewell, sweet playfellow. Pray thou for us,<br>
And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius.<br>
Keep word, Lysander. We must starve our sight<br>
From lovers’ food  till morrow deep midnight. <br>
---
## LYSANDER:
I will, my Hermia. Helena, adieu.<br>
As you on him, Demetrius dote on you<br>
---
## HELENA:
How happy some o’er other some can be!<br>
Through Athens I am thought as fair as she,<br>
But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so;<br>
He will not know what all but he do know.<br>
And as he errs, doting on Hermia’s eyes<br>
---
So I, admiring of his qualities.<br>
Things base and vile, holding no quantity,<br>
Love can transpose to form and dignity.<br>
Love looks not with the eyes but with the mind,<br>
And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind. <br>
---
Nor hath love’s mind of any judgement taste:<br>
Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste.<br>
And therefore is love said to be a child,<br>
Because in choice he is so oft beguiled.<br>
As waggish boys in game themselves forswear<br>
---
So the boy Love is perjured everywhere.<br>
For ere Demetrius looked on Hermia’s eyne,<br>
He hailed down oaths that he was only mine;<br>
And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,<br>
So he dissolved, and showers of oaths did melt<br>
---
I will go tell him of fair Hermia’s flight.<br>
Then to the wood will he tomorrow night<br>
Pursue her; and for this intelligence<br>
If I have thanks, it is a dear expense.<br>
But herein mean I to enrich my pain,<br>
---
To have his sight thither and back again. <br>
---
## QUINCE: 
Is all our company here?<br> 
---
## BOTTOM:
You were best to call them generally, man by<br>
man, according to the scrip.<br>
---
## QUINCE:
Here is the scroll of every man’s name, which is<br>
thought fit through all Athens to play in our interlude <br>
before the duke and the duchess on his wedding day<br>
at night. <br>
---
## BOTTOM:
First, good Peter Quince, say what the play<br>
treats on; then read the names of the actors; and so<br>
grow to a point.<br>
---
## QUINCE:
Marry, our play is ‘The most lamentable comedy<br>
and most cruel death of Pyramus and Thisbe’.<br>
---
## BOTTOM:
A very good piece of work, I assure you, and a<br>
merry. Now good Peter Quince, call forth your actors<br>
by the scroll. Masters, spread yourselves<br>
---
## QUINCE:
You, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus.<br>
---
## BOTTOM:
What is Pyramus? A lover, or a tyrant?<br>
---
## QUINCE:
A lover that kills himself most gallant for love.<br>
---
## BOTTOM:
That will ask some tears in the true performing<br>
of it. If I do it, let the audience look to their eyes. I <br>
will move storms; I will condole, in some measure.<br>
To the rest yet, my chief humour is for a tyrant <br>
The raging rocks <br>
---
And shivering shocks<br>
Shall break the locks<br>
Of prison gates, <br>
And Phibbus’ car<br>
Shall shine from far,<br>
---
And make and mar <br>
The foolish<br>
This was lofty. Now name the rest of the players<br>
---
## QUINCE: 
Francis Flute, the waiter?<br>
---
## FLUTE: 
Here, Peter Quince.<br>
---
## QUINCE: 
Flute, you must take Thisbe on you. <br>
---
## FLUTE: 
What is Thisbe? A wandering knight?<br>
---
## QUINCE: 
It is the lady that Pyramus must love.<br>
---
## FLUTE: 
Nay, faith, let not me play a woman. I have a<br>
beard coming.<br>
---
## QUINCE: 
That’s all one. You shall play it in a mask, and <br>
you may speak as small as you will.<br>
---
## BOTTOM:  
And I may hide my face, let me play Thisbe<br>
too. I’ll speak in a monstrous little voice: ‘Thisne,<br>
Thisne!’ – ‘Ah, Pyramus, my lover dear! Thy Thisbe<br>
dear, and lady dear.’ <br>
---
## QUINCE:
No, no. You must play Pyramus; and Flute, you <br>
Thisbe. <br>
---
## BOTTOM:
Well, proceed.<br>
---
## QUINCE:
Robin Starveling, the electrician?<br>
---
## STARVELING:
Here, Peter Quince. <br>
---
## QUINCE:
Robin Starveling, you must play Thisbe’s<br>
mother. Tom Snout, the sommelier?<br>
---
## SNOUT: 
Here, Peter Quince.<br>
---
## QUINCE: 
You, Pyramus’ father; myself, Thisbe’s father;<br>
the florist, you the Lion’s part; and I hope here<br>
is a play fitted.<br>
---
## SNUG:
Have you the Lion’s part written? Pray you, if it<br>
be, give it me, for I am slow of study.<br>
---
## QUINCE:
You may do it extempore, for it is nothing but<br>
roaring. <br>
---
## BOTTOM: 
Let me play the Lion too. I will roar that I will<br>
do any man’s heart good to hear me. I will roar that I<br>
will make the duke say, ‘Let him roar again, let him<br>
roar again.’<br>
---
## QUINCE:
And you should do it too terribly, you would<br>
fright the duchess and the ladies, that they would<br>
shriek, and that were enough to hang us all. <br>
---
## All:
That would hang us, every mother’s son <br>
---
## BOTTOM:
I grant you, friends, if you should fright<br>
the ladies out of their wits, they would have no more<br>
discretion but to hang us. But I will aggravate my<br>
voice so, that I will roar you as gently as any sucking<br>
dove; I will roar you and ’twere any nightingale<br>
---
## QUINCE:
You can play no part but Pyramus; for Pyramus is<br>
a sweet- faced man, a proper man as one shall see in <br>
a summer’s day, a most lovely gentlemanlike man:<br>
therefore you must needs play Pyramus.<br>
---
## BOTTOM:
Well, I will undertake it. What beard were I<br>
best to play it in?<br>
---
## QUINCE:
Why, what you will.<br>
masters, here<br>
are your parts; and I am to intreat you, request you<br>
and desire you to con them by tomorrow night, and<br>
meet me <br>
---
by moonlight. There will we rehearse; for if we meet <br>
in the city, we shall be dogged with company, and our<br>
devices known. In the meantime, I will draw a bill of<br>
properties such as our play wants. I pray you, fail me<br>
not.<br>
---
## BOTTOM:
We will meet, and there we may rehearse most <br>
obscenely and courageously. Take pains, be perfit.<br>
Adieu<br>
---
## QUINCE: 
At the duke’s oak we meet.<br>
---
## BOTTOM: 
Enough. Hold, or cut bowstrings<br>
---
## ROBIN:
How now, spirit, whither wander you?<br> 
---
## FAIRY:
Over hill, over dale,<br>
Thorough bush, thorough brier,<br>
Over park, over pale,<br>
Thorough flood, thorough fire, <br>
---
I do wander everywhere <br>
Swifter than the moon's sphere,<br>
And I serve the Fairy Queen<br>
To dew her orbs upon the green.<br>
The cowslips tall her pensioners be.<br>
---
In their gold coats, spots you see:<br>
Those be rubies, fairy favors<br>
In those freckles live their savours<br>
I must go seek some dew drops here,<br>
---
And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear.<br>
Farewell, thou lob of spirits; I'll be gone.<br>
Our queen and all her elves come here anon.<br>
---
## ROBIN:
The king doth keep his revels here tonight.<br>
Take heed the queen come not within his sight;<br>
For Oberon is passing fell and wrath<br>
Because that she, as her attendant, hath<br>
---
A lovely boy stolen, from an Indian King:<br>
She never had so sweet a changeling.<br>
And jealous Oberon would have the child<br>
Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild.<br>
---
But she perforce withholds the loved boy,<br>
Crowns him with flowers, and makes him all her joy.<br>
And now, they never meet in grove or green,<br>
By fountain clear or spangled starlight sheen,<br>
---
But they do square, that all their elves, for fear,<br>
Creep into acorn cups and hide them there.<br>
---
## FAIRY:
Either I mistake your shape and making quite, <br>
Or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite<br>
Called Robin Goodfellow. Are not you he<br>
That frights the maidens of the villagery,<br>
---
Those that Hobgoblin call you, and sweet Puck,<br>
You do their work, and they shall have good luck.<br>
Are not you he?<br>
---
## ROBIN:
Thou speak'st aright:<br>
I am that merry wanderer of the night.<br>
I jest to Oberon, and make him smile<br>
When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,<br>
Neighing in likeness of a filly foal.<br>
---
And sometime lurk I in a gossip's bowl<br>
In very likeness of a roasted crab,<br>
And when she drinks, against her lips I bob,<br>
And on her withered dewlap pour the ale.<br>
The wisest aunt telling the saddest tale
---
Sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me;<br>
Then slip I from her bum, down topples she,<br>
And 'Electrician' cries, and falls into cough;<br>
And then the whole choir hold their hips and laugh,<br>
---
And waxen in their mirth, and neeze, and swear <br>
A merrier hour was never wasted there. <br>
But room, fairy. Here comes Oberon. <br>
---
## FAIRY:
And here my mistress. Would that he were gone.
---
## OBERON:
Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania. 
---
## TITANIA:
What, jealous Oberon? Fairies, skip hence. <br>
I have forsworn his bed and company. <br>
---
## OBERON:
Tarry, rash wanton. Am not I thy lord? 
---
## TITANIA:
Then I must be thy lady; but I know <br>
When thou hast stolen away from fairy land <br>
Why art thou here <br>
Come from the farthest steep of India, <br>
But that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon, <br>
---
Your buskined mistress and your warrior love, <br>
To Theseus must be wedded; and you come <br>
To give their bed joy and prosper <br>
---
## OBERON:
How canst thou thus for shame, Titania, <br>
Glance at my credit with Hippolyta, <br>
Knowing I know thy love to Theseus? <br>
---
## TITANIA:
These are the forgeries of jealousy;<br>
And never, since the middle summer’s spring,<br>
Met we on hill, in dale, forest or mead,<br>
By paved fountain or by rushy brook,<br>
Or in the beached margin of the sea <br>
---
To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind, <br>
But with thy brawls thou hast disturbed our sport. <br>
Therefore the winds, piping to us in vain, <br>
As in revenge have sucked up from the sea <br>
Contagious fogs, which, falling in the land, <br>
---
Hath every pelting river made so proud <br>
That they have overborne their continents.<br>
The ox hath therefore stretched his yoke in vain,<br>
The ploughman lost his sweat, and the green corn<br>
Hath rotted ere his youth attained a beard. <br>
---
The fold stands empty in the drowned field, <br>
And crows are fatted with the murrain flock. <br>
The nine men’s morris is filled up with mud, <br>
And the quaint mazes in the wanton green, <br>
For lack of tread, are undistinguishable. <br>
---
The human mortals want their winter here;<br>
No night is now with hymn or carol blest.<br>
Therefore the moon, the governess of floods,<br>
Pale in her anger, washes all the air<br>
That rheumatic diseases do abound.<br>
---
And thorough this distemperature, we see <br>
The seasons alter: hoary- headed frosts <br>
Fall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose, <br>
And on old Hiems’ thin and icy crown <br>
An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds <br>
---
Is, as in mockery, set. The spring, the summer,<br>
The childing autumn, angry winter change<br>
Their wonted liveries; and the mazed world,<br>
By their increase, now knows not which is which.<br>
And this same progeny of evils comes<br>
---
From our debate, from our dissension:<br>
We are their parents and original. <br>
---
## OBERON:
Do you amend it then; it lies in you.<br>
Why should Titania cross her Oberon?<br>
I do but beg a little changeling boy<br>
To be my henchman.<br>
---
## TITANIA:
Set your heart at rest.<br>
The fairy land buys not the child of me.<br>
His mother was a votaress of my order;<br>
And in the spiced Indian air by night,<br>
Full often hath she gossiped by my side, <br>
---
And sat with me on Neptune’s yellow sands <br>
Marking th’embarked traders on the flood,<br>
When we have laughed to see the sails conceive<br>
And grow big- bellied with the wanton wind,<br>
Which she with pretty and with swimming gait<br>
---
Following (her womb then rich with my young<br>
squire)<br>
Would imitate, and sail upon the land<br>
To fetch me trifles and return again<br>
As from a voyage, rich with merchandise. <br>
---
But she, being mortal, of that boy did die, <br>
And for her sake do I rear up her boy;<br>
And for her sake, I will not part with him.<br>
---
## OBERON:
How long within this wood intend you stay? 
---
## TITANIA:
Perchance till after Theseus’ wedding day.<br>
If you will patiently dance in our round<br>
And see our moonlight revels, go with us;<br>
If not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts.<br>
---
## OBERON:
Give me that boy, and I will go with thee.
--- 
## TITANIA:
Not for thy fairy kingdom. Fairies, away. <br>
We shall chide downright if I longer stay. 
---
## OBERON:
Well, go thy way. Thou shalt not from this grove<br>
Till I torment thee for this injury.<br>
My gentle puck, come hither. Thou rememberest<br>
Since once I sat upon a promontory,<br>
And heard a mermaid on a dolphin’s back <br>
---
Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath<br>
That the rude sea grew civil at her song,<br>
And certain stars shot madly from their spheres<br>
To hear the sea-maid's music.<br>
---
## ROBIN:
I remember. <br>
---
## OBERON:
That very time I saw (but thou couldst not) <br>
Flying between the cold moon and the earth<br>
Cupid, all armed. A certain aim he took<br>
At a fair vestal, throned by west,<br>
And loosed his love-shaft smartly from his bow <br>
---
As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts.<br>
But I might see young Cupid’s fiery shaft <br>
Quenched in the chaste beams of the watery moon,<br>
And the imperial votaress passed on <br>
In maiden meditation, fancy free.<br>
---
Yet marked I where the bolt of Cupid fell:<br>
It fell upon a little western flower,<br>
Before milk-white, now purple with love’s wound,<br>
And maidens call it love- in-idleness.<br>
Fetch me that flower: the herb I showed thee once. <br>
---
The juice of it, on sleeping eyelids laid, <br>
Will make or man or woman madly dote <br>
Upon the next live creature that it sees. <br>
Fetch me this herb, and be thou here again <br>
Ere the Leviathan can swim a league. <br>
---
## ROBIN: 
I’ll put a girdle round about the earth <br>
In forty minutes. <br>
---
## OBERON:
Having once this juice, <br>
I’ll watch Titania when she is asleep <br>
And drop the liquor of it in her eyes. <br>
The next thing then she, waking, looks upon,<br>
Be it on lion, bear, or wolf, or bull, <br>
---
On meddling monkey or on busy ape,<br>
She shall pursue it with the soul of love.<br>
And ere I take this charm from off her sight<br>
(As I can take it with another herb),<br>
I’ll make her render up her page to me.<br>
---
But who comes here? I am invisible,<br>
And I will overhear their conference. <br>
---
## DEMETRIUS: 
I love thee not, therefore pursue me not.<br>
Where is Lysander and fair Hermia?<br>
The one I’ll stay; the other stayeth me.<br>
Thou toldst me they were stolen unto this wood;<br>
And here am I, and wood within <br>
---
Because I cannot meet my Hermia.<br>
Hence, get thee gone, and follow me no more. <br>
---
## HELENA: 
You draw me, you hard-hearted adamant; <br>
But yet you draw not iron, for my heart<br>
Is true as steel. Leave you your power to draw,<br>
And I shall have no power to follow you. <br>
---
## DEMETRIUS:
Do I entice you? Do I speak you fair?<br>
Or rather do I not in plainest truth <br>
Tell you I do not, nor I cannot love you.<br>
---
## HELENA:
And even for that do I love you the more.<br>
I am your spaniel, and Demetrius, <br>
Neglect me, loose me; only give me leave,<br>
Unworthy as I am, to follow you.<br>
---
## DEMETRIUS:
Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit;<br>
For I am sick when I do look on thee.
---
## HELENA:
And I am sick when I look not on you. <br>
---
## DEMETRIUS:
You do impeach your modesty too much,<br>
To leave the city and commit yourself <br>
Into the hands of one that loves you not,<br>
To trust the opportunity of night<br>
And the ill counsel of a desert place <br>
---
With the rich worth of your virginity. <br>
---
## HELENA:
Your virtue is my privilege, for that <br>
It is not night when I do see your face.<br>
Therefore I think I am not in the night,<br>
Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company,<br>
For you in my respect are all the world. <br>
---
Then how can it be said I am alone, <br>
When all the world is here to look on me?
---
## DEMETRIUS:
I’ll run from thee and hide me in the brakes,<br>
And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts. 
---
## HELENA:
The wildest hath not such a heart as you.<br>
Run when you will, the story shall be changed: <br>
Apollo flies, and Daphne holds the chase;<br>
The dove pursues the griffon; the mild hind<br>
Makes speed to catch the tiger: bootless speed, <br>
---
When cowardice pursues, and valour flies.<br>
---
## DEMETRIUS:
I will not stay thy questions. Let me go; <br>
Or if thou follow me, do not believe<br>
But I shall do thee mischief in the wood.<br>
---
## HELENA:
Ay, in the temple, in the town, the field<br>
You do me mischief. Fie, Demetrius!<br>
Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex. <br>
We cannot fight for love as men may do;<br>
We should be wooed, and were not made to woo.<br>
---
I'll follow thee, and make a heaven of hell,<br>
To die upon the hand I love so well.
---
## OBERON:
Fare thee well, nymph. Ere he do leave this grove, <br>
Thou shalt fly him, and he shall seek thy love. <br>
Hast thou the flower there? Welcome, wanderer. <br>
---
## ROBIN:
Ay, there it is.
---
## OBERON:
I pray thee give it me. <br>
I know a bank where the wild thyme blows, <br>
Where oxlips and the nodding violets grows, <br>
Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine, <br>
With sweet musk-roses and with eglantine. <br>
---
There sleeps Titania sometime of the night, <br>
Lulled in these flowers with dances and delight; <br>
And there the snake throws her enamelled skin, <br>
Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in. <br>
And with the juice of this I'll streak her eyes, <br>
---
And make her full of hateful fantasies. <br>
Take thou some of it, and seek through this grove: <br>
A sweet Athenian lady is in love <br>
With disdainful youth. Anoint his eyes, <br>
But do it when the next thing he espies <br>
---
May be the lady. Thou shalt know the man <br>
By the Athenian garments he hath on. <br>
Effect it with some care, that he may prove <br>
More fond on her, than she upon her love; <br>
And look thou meet me ere the first cock crow. <br>
---
## ROBIN:
Fear not, my lord; your servant shall do so. <br>
---
## TITANIA:
Come, now a roundel and a fairy song; <br>
Then for the third part of a minute, hence: <br>
Some to kill cankers in the musk-rose buds; <br>
Some war with rearmice for their leathern wings <br>
To make my small elves coats; and some keep back <br>
---
The clamorous owl, that nightly hoots and wonders <br>
At our quaint spirits. Sing me now asleep; <br>
Then to your offices, and let me rest. <br>
---
## 1 FAIRY:
You spotted snakes with double tongue <br>
Thorny hedgehogs, be not seen. <br>
Newts and blindworms, do no wrong, <br>
Come not near our Fairy Queen. <br>
---
## CHORUS:
Philomel, with melody, <br>
Sing in our sweet lullaby, <br>
Lulla, lulla, lullaby; lulla, lulla, lullaby. <br>
Never harm, nor spell, nor charm, <br>
Come our lovely lady nigh. <br>
---
So good night, with lullaby. <br>
---
## 2 FAIRY:
Weaving spiders, come not here - <br>
Hence, you long-legged spinners, hence. <br>
Beetles black, approach not near, <br>
Worm nor snail do no offence. <br>
---
## CHORUS:
Philomel, with melody, <br>
Sing in our sweet lullaby, <br>
Lulla, lulla, lullaby; lulla, lulla, lullaby. <br>
Never harm, nor spell, nor charm, <br>
Come our lovely lady nigh <br>
So good night, with lullaby. <br>
---
## 1 FAIRY:
Hence, away; now all is well. <br>
One aloof stand sentinel. <br>
---
## OBERON:
What thou seest when thou dost wake, <br>
Do it for thy true love take; <br>
Love and languish for his sake. <br>
Be it ounce or cat or bear, <br>
Pard, or boar with bristled hair <br>
---
In thy eye that shall appear <br>
When thou wak'st, it is thy dear. <br>
Wake when some vile thing is near. <br>
---
## LYSANDER:
Fair love, you faint with wandering in the wood, <br>
And to speak troth, I have forgot our way. <br>
We'll rest us, Hermia, if you think it good <br>
And tarry for the comfort of the day. <br>
---
## HERMIA:
Be it so, Lysander. Find you out a bed, <br>
For I upon this bank will rest my head. <br>
---
## LYSANDER:
One turf shall serve as pillow for us both, <br>
One heart, one bed, two bosoms, and one troth. <br>
---
## HERMIA:
Nay, good Lysander; for my sake, my dear, <br>
Lie further off, yet. Do not lie so near. <br>
---
## LYSANDER:
O take the sense, sweet, of my innocence: <br>
Love takes the meaning in love's conference. <br>
I mean that my heart unto yours it knit, <br>
So that but one heart we can make of it: <br>
Two bosoms interchained with an oath, <br>
---
So them two bosoms, and a single troth. <br>
Then by your side no bed-room me deny; <br>
For lying so, Hermia, I do not lie. <br>
---
## HERMIA:
Lysander riddles very prettily. <br>
Now much beshrew my manners and my pride <br>
If Hermia meant to say Lysander lied. <br>
But gentle friend, for love and courtesy, <br>
Lie further off, in human modesty: <br>
---
Such separation as may well be said <br>
Becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid, <br>
So far be distant, and good night, sweet friend. <br>
Thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life end. <br>
---
## LYSANDER:
Amen, amen, to that fair prayer say I, <br>
And then end life, when I end loyalty. <br>
Here is my bed; sleep give thee all his rest. <br>
---
## HERMIA:
With half that wish the wisher's eyes be pressed. <br>
---
## ROBIN:
Through the forest have I gone, <br>
But Athenian found I none <br>
On whose eyes I might approve <br>
This flower's force in stirring love. <br>
Night and silence! Who is here? <br>
---
Weeds of Athens we doth wear. <br>
This is he, my master said, <br>
Despised the Athenian maid; <br>
And here the maiden, sleeping sound <br>
On the dank and dirty ground <br>
---
Pretty soul, she durst not lie <br>
---
Near this lack-love, this kill-courtesy. <br> 
Churl, upon thy eyes I throw <br>
All the power this charm doth owe.<br>
When thou wak’st, let love forbid <br>
Sleep his seat on thy eyelid. <br>
---
So awake, when I am gone; <br>
For I must now to Oberon. <br>
---
## HELENA:
Stay, though thou kill me, sweet Demetrius.<br>
---
## DEMETRIUS:
I charge thee, hence, and do not haunt me thus. <br>
---
## HELENA: 
O, wilt thou darkling leave me? Do not so. <br>
---
## DEMETRIUS: 
Stay, on thy peril. I alone will go.<br>
---
## HELENA:
O, I am out of breath in this fond chase.<br> The more my prayer, the lesser is my grace.<br> Happy is Hermia, wheresoe’er she lies,<br>
For she hath blessed and attractive eyes.<br> How came her eyes so bright? Not with salt tears;<br>
---
If so, my eyes are oftener washed than hers.<br>
No, no: I am as ugly as a bear,<br>
For beasts that meet me run away for fear;<br>
Therefore no marvel though Demetrius <br> 
Do, as a monster, fly my presence thus.<br>
---
What wicked and dissembling glass of mine <br>
Made me compare with Hermia’s sphery eyne?<br>
But who is here? Lysander, on the ground?<br>
Dead, or asleep? I see no blood, no wound.<br>
Lysander, if you live, good sir, awake.<br>
---
## LYSANDER:
And run through fire I will for thy sweet sake.<br>
Transparent Helena, nature shows art,<br>
That through thy bosom makes me see thy heart.<br>
Where is Demetrius? O, how fit a word<br> Is that vile name to perish on my sword!<br>
---
## HELENA:
Do not say so, Lysander, say not so.<br>
What though he love your Hermia? Lord, what<br>
though?<br>
Yet Hermia still loves you; then be content.<br>
---
## LYSANDER:
Content with Hermia? No, I do repent<br> The tedious minutes I with her have spent.<br>
Not Hermia, but Helena I love.<br>
Who will not change a raven for a dove?<br>
The will of man is by his reason swayed,<br>
---
And reason says you are the worthier maid.<br> Things growing are not ripe until their season; <br>
So I, being young, till now ripe not to reason.<br>
And touching now the point of human skill,<br>
Reason becomes the marshal to my will<br>
---
And leads me to your eyes, where I o’erlook <br> Love’s stories, written in love’s richest book.<br>
---
## HELENA:
Wherefore was I to this keen mockery born?<br>
When at your hands did I deserve this scorn?<br>
Is’t not enough, is’t not enough, young man,<br>
That I did never, no nor never can <br> Deserve a sweet look from Demetrius’ eye,<br>
---
But you must flout my insufficiency?<br>
Good troth, you do me wrong; good sooth, you do,<br>
In such disdainful manner me to woo.<br>
But fare you well. Perforce I must confess <br> I thought you lord of more true gentleness.<br>
---
O that a lady of one man refused<br>
Should of another therefore be abused!<br>
---
## LYSANDER:
She sees not Hermia. Hermia, sleep thou there,<br>
And never mayst thou come Lysander near.<br> For as a surfeit of the sweetest things<br>
The deepest loathing to the stomach brings,<br>
Or as the heresies that men do leave<br>
---
Are hated most of those they did deceive,<br>
So thou, my surfeit and my heresy,<br> Of all be hated, but the most of me;<br>
And all my powers, address your love and might<br>
To honour Helen, and to be her knight.<br>
---
##  HERMIA:
Help me, Lysander, help me: do thy best<br>
To pluck this crawling serpent from my breast.<br>  Ay me, for pity! What a dream was here!<br>
Lysander, look how I do quake with fear.<br>
Methought a serpent ate my heart away,<br>
---
And you sat smiling at his cruel prey.<br>
Lysander – what, removed? Lysander, lord – <br> What, out of hearing, gone? No sound, no word?<br>
Alack, where are you? Speak, and if you hear;<br>
Speak, of all loves! I swoon almost with fear.<br>
---
No, then I well perceive you are not nigh.<br>
Either death or you I’ll find immediately.<br>
---
## BOTTOM:
Are we all met?<br>
---
## QUINCE:
Pat, pat; and here’s a marvellous convenient<br>
place for our rehearsal. This green plot shall be our<br>
stage, this hawthorn brake our tiring-house; and we<br>
will do it in action, as we will do it before the duke.<br>
---
## BOTTOM: 
Peter Quince!<br>
---
## QUINCE:
What sayst thou, bully Bottom?<br>
---
## BOTTOM:
There are things in this comedy of Pyramus <br>
and Thisbe that will never please. First, Pyramus must <br> draw a sword to kill himself, which the ladies cannot<br> abide. How answer you that?<br>
---
## SNOUT: 
Byrlakin, a parlous fear.<br>
---
## STARVELING:
I believe we must leave the killing out,<br>
when all is done.<br>
---
## BOTTOM:
Not a whit. I have a device to make all well.<br>
Write me a prologue, and let the prologue seem to say<br>
we will do no harm with our swords, and that Pyramus<br>
is not killed indeed; and for the more better assurance,<br>
tell them that I, Pyramus, am not Pyramus, but Bottom<br>
---
the pastry chef. This will put them out of fear. <br>
---
## QUINCE:
Well, we will have such a prologue, and it shall<br> 
be written in eight and six.<br>
---
## BOTTOM:
No, make it two more. Let it be written in eight<br>
and eight.<br>
---
## SNOUT:
Will not the ladies be afeared of the Lion? <br>
---
## STARVELING: 
I fear it, I promise you.<br>
---
## BOTTOM:
Masters, you ought to consider with yourself: to<br>
bring in (God shield us) a lion among ladies is a most <br> dreadful thing; for there is not a more fearful wild-<br> fowl than your lion living, and we ought to look to’t.<br>
---
## SNOUT:
Therefore another prologue must tell he is not <br>
a lion<br>
---
## BOTTOM:
Nay, you must name his name, and half his<br> face must be seen through the lion’s neck, and he <br> himself must speak through, saying thus, or to the <br> same defect: ‘Ladies’, or ‘Fair ladies, I would wish<br> you’, or ‘I would request you’, or ‘I would entreat<br>
---
you, not to fear, not to tremble: my life for yours. If <br> you think I come hither as a lion, it were pity of my <br> life. No, I am no such thing. I am a man as other men <br> are.’ And there, indeed, let him name his name, and <br> tell them plainly he is Snug the florist.<br>
---
## QUINCE:
Well, it shall be so. But there is two hard things:<br>
that is, to bring the moonlight into a chamber; for you <br> know Pyramus and Thisbe meet by moonlight.<br>
---
## SNOUT:
Doth the moon shine that night we play our play? <br>
---
## BOTTOM: 
A calendar, a calendar: look in the almanac.<br>
Find out moonshine, find out moonshine.<br>
---
## QUINCE:
Yes, it doth shine that<br>
night. <br>
---
## BOTTOM:
Why, then may you leave a casement of the<br>
great chamber window, where we play, open; and the<br> 
moon may shine in at the casement.<br>
---
## QUINCE: 
Ay, or else one must come in with a bush of<br>
thorns and a lantern, and say he comes to disfigure or <br>
to present the person of Moonshine. Then there is <br>
another thing: we must have a wall in the great <br>
chamber; for Pyramus and Thisbe, says the story, did<br>
---
talk through the chink of a wall.<br>
---
## SNOUT:
You can never bring in a wall. What say you,<br>
Bottom?<br>
---
## BOTTOM:
Some man or other must present Wall; and let<br>
him have some plaster, or some loam, or some <br>
roughcast about him, to signify Wall; and let him hold <br>
his fingers thus, and through that cranny shall Pyramus<br> 
and Thisbe whisper. <br>
---
## QUINCE:
If that may be, then all is well. Come, sit down <br>
every mother’s son, and rehearse your parts. Pyramus,<br>
you begin. When you have spoken your speech, <br>
enter into that brake; and so every one according to <br>
his cue.<br>
---
## ROBIN: 
What hempen homespuns have we swaggering here,<br>
So near the cradle of the Fairy Queen?<br>
What, a play toward? I’ll be an auditor;<br>
An actor too, perhaps, if I see cause.<br>
---
## QUINCE:
Speak, Pyramus. Thisbe, stand forth. <br>
---
## BOTTOM:
Thisbe, the flowers of odious savours sweet.<br>
---
## QUINCE:
Odours, odours <br>
---
## BOTTOM:
. . . odours savours sweet.<br>
So hath thy breath, my dearest Thisbe dear<br> 
But hark, a voice. Stay thou but here a while,<br>
And by and by I will to thee appear.<br>
---
## ROBIN:
. . . A stranger Pyramus than ere played here.<br>
---
## FLUTE: 
Must I speak now?<br>
---
## QUINCE: 
Ay, marry, must you. For you must understand <br>
he goes but to see a noise that he heard, and is to come<br>
again.<br>
---
## FLUTE:
Most radiant Pyramus, most lily-white of hue,<br>
Of colour like the red rose on triumphant brier,<br>
Most brisky man and puissant through and through,<br>
As true as truest horse that yet would never tire, <br>
I’ll meet thee, Pyramus, at Ninny’s tomb.<br>
---
## QUINCE: 
Ninus’ tomb, man. Why, you must not speak<br>
that yet. That you answer to Pyramus. You speak all<br>
your part at once, cues and all. Pyramus, enter; your<br> 
cue is past. It is ‘never tire’.<br>
---
## FLUTE: 
O!<br>
As true as truest horse, that yet would never tire.<br>
---
## BOTTOM: 
If I were, fair Thisbe, I were only thine.<br>
---
## QUINCE: 
O monstrous! O strange! We are haunted. Pray, <br>
masters; fly, masters. Help! <br>
---
## ROBIN: 
I’ll follow you; I’ll lead you about a round, <br>
Through bog, through bush, through brake, through <br> 
brier.<br>
Sometime a horse I’ll be, sometime a hound,<br>
A hog, a headless bear, sometime a fire, <br>
---
And neigh, and bark, and grunt, and roar, and burn,<br>
Like horse, hound, hog, bear, fire, at every turn.<br>
---
## BOTTOM: 
Why do they run away? This is a knavery of <br>
them to make me afeard.<br>
---
## SNOUT: 
O Bottom, thou art changed. What do I see <br>
on thee?<br>
## BOTTOM:
What do you see? You see an ass-head of your<br>
own, do you?<br>
---
## QUINCE:
Bless thee Bottom, bless thee! Thou art<br>
translated. <br>
---
## BOTTOM: 
I see their knavery. This is to make an ass of<br> 
me, to fright me if they could; but I will not stir from<br>
this place, do what they can. I will walk up and down <br>
here, and I will sing, that they shall hear I am not <br>
afraid. <br>
---
The ousel cock so black of hue <br>
With orange-tawny bill,<br>
The throstle with his note so true, <br>
The wren with little quill.<br>
---
## TITANIA: 
What angel wakes me from my flowery bed? <br> 
---
## BOTTOM: 
The finch, the sparrow and the lark,<br>
The plainsong cuckoo gray,<br>
Whose note full many a man doth mark,<br>
And dares not answer nay.<br>
For indeed, who would set his wit to so foolish a bird?<br>
---
Who would give a bird the lie, though he cry cuckoo <br>
never so? <br>
---
## TITANIA: 
I pray thee, gentle mortal, sing again:<br>
Mine ear is much enamoured of thy note.<br>
So is mine eye enthralled to thy shape, <br> 
And thy fair virtue’s force perforce doth move me <br>
On the first view to say, to swear, I love thee.<br>
---
## BOTTOM: 
Methinks, mistress, you should have little <br>
reason for that. And yet to say the truth, reason and<br>
love keep little company together nowadays; the <br>
more the pity that some honest neighbours will not <br>
make them friends. Nay, I can gleek upon occasion<br>
---
## TITANIA:
Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful.<br>
---
## BOTTOM: 
Not so neither; but if I had wit enough to get out<br>
of this wood, I have enough to serve mine own turn.<br>
--- 
## TITANIA: 
Out of this wood do not desire to go.<br>
Thou shalt remain here, whether thou wilt or no.<br>
I am a spirit of no common rate:<br>
The summer still doth tend upon my state,<br>
And I do love thee; therefore go with me.<br>
---
I’ll give thee fairies to attend on thee,<br>
And they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep,<br>
And sing while thou on pressed flowers dost sleep;<br>
And I will purge thy mortal grossness so,<br>
That thou shalt like an airy spirit go.<br>
---
Peaseblossom, Cobweb, Mote, and Mustardseed!<br>
---
## PEASEBLOSSOM: 
Ready. <br>
---
## COBWEB: 
And I. <br>
---
## MOTE: 
And I. <br>
---
## MUSTARDSEED: 
And I. <br>
---
## ALL: 
Where shall we go? <br>
---
## TITANIA:
Be kind and courteous to this gentleman.<br>
Hop in his walks, and gambol in his eyes.<br>
Feed him with apricots and dewberries, <br> 
With purple grapes, green figs and mulberries.<br>
The honey-bags steal from the humble-bees,<br>
---
Nod to him, elves, and do him courtesies.<br>
---
## PEASEBLOSSOM:
Hail, mortal.<br>
---
## COBWEB:
Hail. <br>
---
## MOTE:
Hail.<br>
---
## MUSTARDSEED:
Hail. <br>
---
## BOTTOM:
I cry your worships mercy, heartily. I beseech <br>
your worship’s name. <br>
---
## COBWEB:
Cobweb.<br>
---
## BOTTOM:
I shall desire you of more acquaintance, good <br>
Master Cobweb. If I cut my finger, I shall make bold <br>
with you. Your name, honest gentleman? <br>
---
## PEASEBLOSSOM:
Peaseblossom. <br>
---
## BOTTOM:
I pray you commend me to Mistress Squash,<br>
your mother, and to Master Peascod, your father. <br>
Your name, I beseech you, sir?<br>
---
## MUSTARDSEED:
Mustardseed. <br>
---
## BOTTOM:
Good Master Mustardseed, I know your patience<br>
well.<br>
I desire you more acquaintance, good Master <br>
Mustardseed.<br>
---
## TITANIA:
Come, wait upon him; lead him to my bower.<br>
The moon, methinks, looks with a watery eye;<br>
And when she weeps, weeps every little flower,<br>
Lamenting some enforced chastity.<br>
Tie up my lover’s tongue, bring him silently. <br>
---
## OBERON:
I wonder if Titania be awaked;<br>
Then what it was that next came in her eye,<br>
Which she must dote on in extremity. <br>
---
Here comes my messenger. How now, mad spirit?<br>
What night- rule now about this haunted grove? <br>
---
## ROBIN:
My mistress with a monster is in love.<br>
Near to her close and consecrated bower,<br>
While she was in her dull and sleeping hour,<br>
A crew of patches, rude mechanicals<br>
That work for bread upon Athenian stalls<br>
---
Were met together to rehearse a play<br>
Intended for great Theseus’ nuptial day.<br>
The shallowest thickskin of that barren sort,<br>
Who Pyramus presented in their sport,<br>
Forsook his scene and entered in a brake, <br>
---
When I did him at this advantage take:<br>
An ass’s nole I fixed on his head.<br>
Anon his Thisbe must be answered,<br>
And forth my minic comes. When they him spy,<br>
As wild geese that the creeping fowler eye,<br>
---
Or russet- pated choughs, many in sort<br>
Rising and cawing at the gun’s report,<br>
Sever themselves and madly sweep the sky,<br>
So at his sight away his fellows fly;<br>
And at our stamp, here o’er and o’er one falls,<br> 
---
He ‘Murder’ cries, and help from Athens calls.<br> 
Their sense, thus weak, lost with their fears thus<br> 
strong,<br> 
Made senseless things begin to do them wrong;<br> 
For briers and thorns at their apparel snatch –<br> 
---
Some sleeves, some hats; from yielders, all things<br>
catch. <br>
I led them on in this distracted fear,<br>
And left sweet Pyramus translated there;<br>
When in that moment, so it came to pass,<br>
---
Titania waked, and straightway loved an ass. <br>
---
## OBERON:
This falls out better than I could devise. <br>
But hast thou yet latched the Athenian’s eyes<br>
With the love- juice, as I did bid thee do? <br>
---
## ROBIN:
I took him sleeping (that is finished too)<br>
And the Athenian woman by his side,<br>
That when he waked, of force she must be eyed. <br>
---
## OBERON:
Stand close. This is the same Athenian. <br>

## ROBIN:
This is the woman, but not this the man. <br>
---
## DEMETRIUS:
O, why rebuke you him that loves you so?<br>
Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe. <br>
---
## HERMIA:
Now I but chide; but I should use thee worse, <br>
For thou, I fear, hast given me cause to curse.<br>
If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep,<br>
Being o’er shoes in blood, plunge in the deep<br>
And kill me too.<br>
---
The sun was not so true unto the day <br>
As he to me. Would he have stolen away<br>
From sleeping Hermia? I’ll believe as soon <br>
This whole earth may be bored, and that the moon<br>
May through the centre creep, and so displease<br>
---
Her brother’s noontide with th’antipodes. <br>
It cannot be but thou hast murdered him.<br>
So should a murderer look: so dead, so grim. <br>
--- 
## DEMETRIUS:
So should the murdered look, and so should I,<br>
Pierced through the heart with your stern cruelty.<br>
Yet you, the murderer, look as bright, as clear <br>
As yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere. <br>
---
## HERMIA:
What’s this to my Lysander? Where is he?<br>
Ah, good Demetrius, wilt thou give him me? <br>
---
## DEMETRIUS:
I had rather give his carcass to my hounds. <br>
---
## HERMIA:
Out, dog, out, cur! Thou driv’st me past the bounds <br>
Of maiden’s patience. Hast thou slain him then?<br>
Henceforth be never numbered among men. <br>
O, once tell true: tell true, even for my sake,<br>
Durst thou have looked upon him, being awake, <br>
---
And hast thou killed him sleeping? O brave touch! <br>
Could not a worm, an adder do so much?<br>
An adder did it; for with doubler tongue<br>
Than thine, thou serpent, never adder stung. <br>
---
## DEMETRIUS:
You spend your passion on a misprised mood.<br>
I am not guilty of Lysander’s blood, <br>
Nor is he dead, for aught that I can tell. <br>
---
## HERMIA:
I pray thee, tell me then that he is well. <br>
---
## DEMETRIUS:
And if I could, what should I get therefor? <br>
---
## HERMIA:
A privilege never to see me more.<br>
And from thy hated presence part I so.<br>
See me no more, whether he be dead or no.<br>
---
## DEMETRIUS:
There is no following her in this fierce vein;<br>
Here, therefore, for a while I will remain.<br>
So sorrow’s heaviness doth heavier grow <br>
For debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe, <br>
---
## DEMETRIUS:
Which now in some slight measure it will pay,<br>
If for his tender here I make some stay. <br>
---
## OBERON:
What hast thou done? Thou hast mistaken quite,<br>
And laid the love- juice on some true love’s sight.<br>
Of thy misprision must perforce ensue<br> 
Some true love turned, and not a false turned true. <br>
---
## ROBIN:
Then fate o’errules, that one man holding troth,<br>
A million fail, confounding oath on oath<br>
---
## OBERON:
About the wood go swifter than the wind,<br>
And Helena of Athens look thou find.<br> 
All fancy- sick she is and pale of cheer,<br>
With sighs of love that costs the fresh blood dear. <br>
---
## OBERON:
By some illusion see thou bring her here.<br>
I’ll charm his eyes, against she do appear. 
---
## ROBIN:
I go, I go, look how I go,<br>
Swifter than arrow from the Tartar’s bow.<br>
---
## OBERON:
Flower of this purple dye,<br>
Hit with Cupid’s archery,<br>
Sink in apple of his eye.<br>
When his love he doth espy, <br>
---
## OBERON:
Let her shine as gloriously<br>
As the Venus of the sky.<br>
When thou wak’st, if she be by,<br>
Beg of her for remedy.
---
## ROBIN:
Captain of our fairy band,<br> 
Helena is here at hand,<br>
And the youth mistook by me <br>
Pleading for a lover’s fee.<br>
---
## ROBIN:
Shall we their fond pageant see?<br>
Lord, what fools these mortals be! <br>
---
## OBERON:
Stand aside. The noise they make <br>
Will cause Demetrius to awake. <br>
---
## ROBIN:
Then will two at once woo one:<br>
That must needs be sport alone.<br>
And those things do best please me <br>
That befall preposterously.<br>
--- 
## LYSANDER:
Why should you think that I should woo in scorn? <br>
Scorn and derision never come in tears. <br>
Look when I vow, I weep; and vows so born,<br>
In their nativity all truth appears.<br>
---
## LYSANDER:
How can these things in me seem scorn to you, <br>
Bearing the badge of faith to prove them true? <br>
---
## HELENA :
You do advance your cunning more and more.<br>
When truth kills truth, O devilish holy fray!<br>
These vows are Hermia’s: will you give her o’er? <br>
Weigh oath with oath, and you will nothing weigh.<br>
---
## HELENA:
Your vows to her and me, put in two scales,<br>
Will even weigh, and both as light as tales. <br>
---
## LYSANDER:
I had no judgement when to her I swore. <br>
---
## HELENA:
Nor none, in my mind, now you give her o'er.<br>
---
## LYSANDER:
Demetrius loves her, and he loves not you.<br>
---
## DEMETRIUS:
Helen, goddess, nymph, perfect, divine, <br>
To what, my love, shall I compare thine eyne?<br>
Crystal is muddy. O, how ripe in show<br>
Thy lips, those kissing cherries, tempting grow! <br>
---
## DEMETRIUS:
That pure congealed white, high Taurus’ snow,<br>
Fanned with the eastern wind, turns to a crow<br>
When thou hold’st up thy hand. O let me kiss<br>
This impress of pure white, this seal of bliss!<br>
---
## HELENA:
O spite! O hell! I see you all are bent <br>
To set against me for your merriment.<br>
If you were civil and knew courtesy,<br> 
You would not do me thus much injury.<br>
Can you not hate me, as I know you do,<br>
---
## HELENA:
But you must join in souls to mock me too?<br>
If you were men, as men you are in show,<br>
You would not use a gentle lady so,<br>
To vow and swear and superpraise my parts<br>
When I am sure you hate me with your hearts.<br>
---
## HELENA:
You both are rivals and love Hermia,<br> 
And now both rivals to mock Helena.<br>
A trim exploit, a manly enterprise,<br>
To conjure tears up in a poor maid’s eyes<br>
---
## HELENA:
With your derision! None of noble sort<br>
Would so offend a virgin, and extort<br> 
A poor soul’s patience, all to make you sport. <br>
---
## LYSANDER:
You are unkind, Demetrius; be not so,<br>
For you love Hermia: this you know I know.<br>
And here with all good will, with all my heart,<br>
In Hermia’s love I yield you up my part; <br>
---
## LYSANDER:
And yours of Helena to me bequeath,<br>
Whom I do love, and will do till my death. <br>
--- 
## HELENA:
Never did mockers waste more idle breath. <br>
---
## LYSANDER:
Helen, it is not so. <br>
---
## DEMETRIUS:
Disparage not the faith thou dost not know,<br>
Lest, to thy peril, thou abye it dear. <br>
Look where thy love comes: yonder is thy dear. <br>
---
## HERMIA:
But why, unkindly, didst thou leave me so?<br>
---
## LYSANDER:
Why should he stay, whom love doth press to go?<br>
---
## HERMIA:
What love could press Lysander from my side?<br>
---
## LYSANDER:
Lysander’s love, that would not let him bide:<br>
Fair Helena, who more engilds the night<br>
Than all yon fiery oes and eyes of light.<br>
---
## LYSANDER:
Why seek’st thou me? Could not this make thee<br>
know,<br>
The hate I bare thee made me leave thee so?<br>
---
## HERMIA:
You speak not as you think. It cannot be. <br>
---
## HELENA:
Lo, she is one of this confederacy.<br>
Now I perceive, they have conjoined all three<br>
To fashion this false sport in spite of me.<br>
Injurious Hermia, most ungrateful maid,<br>
Have you conspired, have you with these contrived<br>
---
## HELENA:
To bait me with this foul derision?<br>
Is all the counsel that we two have shared,<br>
The sisters’ vows, the hours that we have spent,<br>
When we have chid the hasty- footed time <br>
---
## HELENA:
For parting us – O, is all forgot?<br>
All schooldays’ friendship, childhood innocence?<br>
We, Hermia, like two artificial gods,<br>
Have with our needles created both one flower,<br>
---
## HELENA:
Both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion,<br>
Both warbling of one song, both in one key,<br>
As if our hands, our sides, voices and minds<br>
Had been incorporate. So we grew together. <br>
---
## HELENA:
And will you rent our ancient love asunder <br>
To join with men in scorning your poor friend?<br>
It is not friendly, ’tis not maidenly.<br>
Our sex, as well as I, may chide you for it,<br>
Though I alone do feel the injury. <br>
---
## HERMIA:
I am amazed at your passionate words.<br>
I scorn you not; it seems that you scorn me.<br>
---
## HELENA:
Have you not set Lysander, as in scorn,<br>
To follow me and praise my eyes and face?<br>
And made your other love Demetrius,<br>
Who even but now did spurn me with his foot, <br>
To call me goddess, nymph, divine and rare,<br>
---
## HELENA:
Precious, celestial? Wherefore speaks he this <br>
To her he hates? And wherefore doth Lysander<br>
Deny your love, so rich within his soul,<br>
And tender me, forsooth, affection, <br>
But by your setting on, by your consent? <br>
---
## HERMIA:
I understand not what you mean by this. <br>
---
## HELENA:
I do. Persevere, counterfeit sad looks,<br>
Make mouths upon me when I turn my back,<br>
Wink each at other, hold the sweet jest up.<br>
This sport, well carried, shall be chronicled. <br>
--- 
## HELENA:
If you have any pity, grace or manners,<br>
You would not make me such an argument.<br>
But fare ye well. ’Tis partly my own fault,<br>
Which death or absence soon shall remedy. <br>
---
## LYSANDER:
Stay, gentle Helena; hear my excuse,<br> 
My love, my life, my soul, fair Helena. <br>
---
## HELENA:
O excellent! <br>
---
## HERMIA:
Sweet, do not scorn her so. <br>
---
## DEMETRIUS:
If she cannot entreat, I can compel.<br>
---
## LYSANDER:
Thou canst compel no more than she entreat.<br>
Thy threats have no more strength than her weak<br>
prayers. <br>
Helen, I love thee, by my life I do.<br>
--- 
## LYSANDER:
I swear by that which I will lose for thee<br>
To prove him false that says I love thee not. <br>
---
## DEMETRIUS:
I say, I love thee more than he can do. <br>
---
## LYSANDER: 
If thou say so, withdraw, and prove it too. <br>
---
## DEMETRIUS :
Quick, come. <br>
---
## HERMIA :
Lysander, whereto tends all this?<br>
---
## LYSANDER:
Away, you malmsey-butt. <br>
---
## DEMETRIUS:
No, no he'll seem<br>
To break loose, take on as you would follow,<br>
But yet come not  You are a tame<br>
man, go. <br>
---
## LYSANDER:
Hang off, thou cat, thou burr, vile thing let loose,thou burr,<br>
Or I will shake thee from me like a serpent.<br>
---
## HERMIA:
Why are you grown so rude? What change is this,<br>
Sweet love?<br>
---
## LYSANDER:
Thy love? Out tickle-brained strumpet <br>
Out, loathed medicine; O hated potion, hence.<br>
---
## HERMIA:
Do you not jest?<br>
---
## HELENA :
Yes, sooth, and so do you.<br>
---
## LYSANDER:
Demetrius, I will keep my word with thee.<br>
---
## DEMETRIUS:
I would I had your bond; for I perceive<br>
A weak bond holds you. I’ll not trust your word.<br>
---
## LYSANDER:
What, should I hurt her, strike her, kill her dead?<br>
Although I hate her, I’ll not harm her so.<br>
---
## HERMIA:
What, can you do me greater harm than hate?<br>
Hate me, wherefore? O me, what news, my love?<br>
Am not I Hermia? Are not you Lysander?<br>
I am as fair now as I was erewhile.<br>
---
## HERMIA:
Since night you loved me, yet since night you left<br>
me.<br>
Why then, you left me (O the gods forbid) <br>
In earnest, shall I say?<br>
---
## LYSANDER :
Ay, by my life, <br>
And never did desire to see thee more.<br>
Therefore be out of hope, of question, of doubt;<br>
Be certain, nothing truer: ’tis no jest<br>
That I do hate thee, and love Helena.<br>
---
## HERMIA:
O me, you juggler, you canker- blossom,<br>
You thief of love! What, have you come by night<br>
And stolen my love’s heart from him?<br>
---
## HELENA :
Fine, i’ faith.<br>
Have you no modesty, no maiden shame,<br>
No touch of bashfulness? What, will you tear<br>
Impatient answers from my gentle tongue?<br>
Fie, fie, you counterfeit, you puppet, you!<br>
---
## HERMIA:
Puppet? Why so? Aye, that way goes the game.<br>
Now I perceive that she hath made compare<br>
Between our statures: she hath urged her height,<br>
And with her personage, her tall personage,<br>
Her height, forsooth, she hath prevailed with him.<br>
---
## HERMIA:
And are you grown so high in his esteem<br>
Because I am so dwarfish and so low?<br>
How low am I, thou painted maypole? Speak,<br>
How low am I? I am not yet so low<br>
But that my nails can reach unto thine eyes.<br>
---
## HELENA:
I pray you, though you mock me, gentlemen, <br>
Let her not hurt me. I was never curst;<br> 
I have no gift at all in shrewishness.<br>
I am a right maid for my cowardice:<br>
---
## HELENA:
Let her not strike me. You perhaps may think<br>
Because she is something lower than myself,<br>
That I can match her.<br>
---
## HERMIA :
Lower? Hark again.<br>
---
## HELENA:
Good Hermia, do not be so bitter with me.<br>
I evermore did love you, Hermia,<br>
Did ever keep your counsels, never wronged you,<br>
---
## HELENA:
Save that in love unto Demetrius,<br>
I told him of your stealth unto this wood.<br>
He followed you; for love, I followed him.<br>
But he hath chid me hence, and threatened me <br>
To strike me, spurn me, nay to kill me too. <br>
---
## HELENA:
And now...
To Athens will I bear my folly back, <br>
And follow you no further. Let me go. <br>
You see how simple and how fond I am. <br>
---
## HERMIA:
Why, get you gone. Who is’t that hinders you? <br>
---
## HELENA:
A foolish heart, that I leave here behind. <br>
---
## HERMIA:
What, with Lysander? <br>
---
## HELENA:
With Demetrius. <br>
---
## LYSANDER:
Be not afraid. She shall not harm thee, Helena. <br>
---
## DEMETRIUS:
No, sir, she shall not, though you take her part. <br>
---
## HELENA:
O, when she is angry, she is keen and shrewd. <br>
She was a vixen when she went to school; <br>
And though she be but little, she is fierce. <br>
---
## HERMIA:
Little again? Nothing but low and little? <br>
Why will you suffer her to flout me thus? <br>
Let me come to her. <br>
---
## LYSANDER:
Get you gone, you dwarf, <br>
You minimus, of hindering knot- grass made, <br>
You bead, you acorn. <br>

---
## DEMETRIUS:
In her behalf that scorns your services.  <br>
Let her alone. Speak not of Helena,  <br>
Take not her part. For if thou dost intend <br>
Never so little show of love to her, <br>
Thou shalt abye it <br>

---
## LYSANDER:
Now she holds me not.  <br>
Now follow, if thou dar’st, to try whose right,  <br>
Of thine or mine, is most in Helena.  <br>

---
## DEMETRIUS :
Follow? Nay, I’ll go with thee, cheek by jowl. <br>
---
## HERMIA:
You, mistress, all this coil is long of you. <br>
Nay, go not back <br>
---
## HELENA:
I will not trust you, I, <br>
Nor longer stay in your curst company.<br>
Your hands than mine are quicker for a fray; <br>
My legs are longer, though, to run away. <br>
---
## HERMIA:
I am amazed, and know not what to say. <br>

---
## OBERON:
This is thy negligence. Still thou mistak’st, <br>
Or else commit’st thy knaveries wilfully <br>
---
## ROBIN:
Believe me, king of shadows, I mistook.<br>
Did not you tell me I should know the man <br>
By the Athenian garments he had on? <br>
---
## ROBIN:
And so far blameless proves my enterprise, <br>
That I have ’nointed an Athenian’s eyes; <br>
And so far am I glad it so did sort, <br>
As this their jangling I esteem a sport. <br>
---
## OBERON:
Thou seest these lovers seek a place to fight. <br>
Hie therefore, Robin, overcast the night; <br>
The starry welkin cover thou anon <br>
With drooping fog as black as Acheron, <br>
And lead these testy rivals so astray <br>
As one come not within another’s way.
---
## OBERON:
Like to Lysander sometime frame thy tongue, <br>
Then stir Demetrius up with bitter wrong,<br>
And sometime rail thou like Demetrius,<br>
And from each other look thou lead them thus<br>
Till o’er their brows, death- counterfeiting, sleep<br>
With leaden legs and batty wings doth creep.
---
## OBERON:
Then crush this herb into Lysander’s eye,<br>
Whose liquor hath this virtuous property<br>
To take from thence all error with his might,<br>
And make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight. 
---
## OBERON:
When they next wake, all this derision <br>
Shall seem a dream and fruitless vision,<br>
And back to Athens shall the lovers wend<br>
With league whose date till death shall never end.
---
## OBERON:
Whiles I in this affair do thee employ,<br>
I’ll to my queen and beg her Indian boy; <br>
And then I will her charmed eye release <br>
From monster’s view, and all things shall be peace.
---
## ROBIN:
My fairy lord, this must be done with haste,<br>
For night’s swift dragons cut the clouds full fast
---
## OBERON:
But notwithstanding, haste, make no delay. <br>
We may effect this business yet ere day. 
---
## ROBIN:
Up and down, up and down,<br>
I will lead them up and down.<br>
I am feared in field and town.<br>
Goblin, lead them up and down.<br>
Here comes one.
---
## LYSANDER:
Where art thou, proud Demetrius? Speak thou now.
---
## ROBIN:
Here, villain, drawn and ready. Where art thou?
---
## LYSANDER:
I will be with thee straight.
---
---
## ROBIN :
Follow me then<br>
To plainer ground.
---
## DEMETRIUS :
Lysander, speak again.<br>
Thou runaway, thou coward, art thou fled? <br>
Speak: in some bush? Where dost thou hide thy head?<br>
---
## ROBIN:
Thou coward, art thou bragging to the stars,<br>
Telling the bushes that thou look’st for wars,<br>
And wilt not come? Come, recreant, come, thou child.<br>
I’ll whip thee with a rod: he is defiled <br>
That draws a sword on thee.
---
## DEMETRIUS :
Yea, art thou there?
---
## ROBIN:
Follow my voice. We’ll try no manhood here.
---
## LYSANDER:
He goes before me, and still dares me on;<br>
When I come where he calls, then he is gone.<br>
The villain is much lighter heeled than I: <br>
I followed fast, but faster he did fly,<br>
That fallen am I in dark uneven way,<br>
And here will rest me.<br>
---
## LYSANDER:
Come, thou gentle day,<br>
For if but once thou show me thy gray light,<br>
I’ll find Demetrius, and revenge this spite. <br>
---
## ROBIN:
Ho, ho, ho! Coward, why com’st thou not?
---
## DEMETRIUS:
Abide me, if thou dar’st. For well I wot,<br>
Thou run’st before me, shifting every place,<br>
And dar’st not stand nor look me in the face.<br>
Where art thou now?
---
## ROBIN :
Come hither. I am here. 
---
## DEMETRIUS:
Nay then, thou mockst me. Thou shalt buy this dear <br>
If ever I thy face by daylight see;<br>
Now go thy way. Faintness constraineth me<br>
To measure out my length on this cold bed. <br>
By day’s approach look to be visited.
---
## HELENA:
O weary night, O long and tedious night,<br>
Abate thy hours. Shine, comforts, from the, <br>
That I may back to Athens by daylight<br>
From these that my poor company detest;<br>
And sleep, that sometimes shuts up sorrow’s eye, <br>
Steal me a while from mine own company.
---
## ROBIN:
Yet but three? Come one more.<br>
Two of both kinds makes up four.<br>
Here she comes, curst and sad.<br>
Cupid is a knavish lad, <br>
Thus to make poor females 
---
## HERMIA:
Never so weary, never so in woe,<br>
Bedabbled with the dew, and torn with briers,<br>
I can no further crawl, no further go;<br>
My legs can keep no pace with my desires.<br> 
Here will I rest me till the break of day.<br>
Heavens shield Lysander, if they mean a fray. <br>
---
## ROBIN :
On the ground<br>
Sleep sound.<br>
I’ll apply <br>
To your eye,<br>
Gentle lover, remedy.<br>
When thou wak’st,
---
## ROBIN:
more chiming bells
Thou tak’st<br>
True delight <br>
In the sight<br>
Of thy former lady’s eye;<br>
And the country proverb known,
---
## ROBIN:
That every man should take his own,<br>
In your waking shall be shown. <br>
Jack shall have Jill,<br>
Nought shall go ill,<br>
The man shall have his mare again, and all shall<br>
be well.
---
## TITANIA:
Come sit thee down upon this flowery bed<br>
While I thy amiable cheeks do coy<br>
And stick musk- roses in thy sleek smooth head,<br>
And kiss thy fair large ears, my gentle joy.
---
## BOTTOM :
Where’s Peaseblossom? 
---
## PEASEBLOSSOM :
Ready.
---
## BOTTOM :
Scratch my head, Peaseblossom. Where’s<br>
Monsieur Cobweb?
---
## COBWEB :
Ready.
---
## BOTTOM :
Monsieur Cobweb, good Monsieur, get you<br>
your weapons in your hand, and kill me a red- hipped<br>
humble- bee on the top of a thistle; and good Monsieur,<br>
bring me the honey- bag. Do not fret yourself too<br>
much in the action, Monsieur; and good Monsieur,
---
## BOTTOM:
have a care the honey- bag break not. I would be loath<br>
to have you overflown with a honey- bag, Signor.<br>
Where’s Monsieur Mustardseed? 
---
## MUSTARDSEED :
What’s your will?
---
## BOTTOM:
Nothing, good Monsieur, but to help Cavalery<br>
Cobweb to scratch. I must to the barber’s, Monsieur,<br>
for methinks I am marvellous hairy about the face;<br>
and I am such a tender ass, if my hair do but tickle me,<br>
I must scratch.
---
## TITANIA:
What, wilt thou hear some music, my sweet love?
---
## BOTTOM :
I have a reasonable good ear in music. Let’s<br>
have the tongs and the bones. 
---
## TITANIA:
Or say, sweet love, what thou desirest to eat.
---
## BOTTOM :
Truly, a peck of provender. I could munch your <br>
good dry oats. Methinks I have a great desire to a <br>
bottle of hay. Good hay, sweet hay, hath no fellow.
---
## TITANIA:
I have a venturous fairy, that shall seek<br>
The squirrel’s hoard, and fetch thee new nuts.
---
## BOTTOM :
I had rather have a handful or two of dried<br>
peas. But I pray you, let none of your people stir me.<br>
I have an exposition of sleep come upon me.
---
## TITANIA:
Sleep thou, and I will wind thee in my arms.<br>
Fairies, be gone, and be always away.<br>
So doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle<br>
Gently entwist; the female ivy so<br>
Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.<br>
O how I love thee! How I dote on thee!
---
## OBERON:
Welcome, good Robin. Seest thou this sweet sight? <br>
Her dotage now I do begin to pity.<br>
For meeting her of late behind the wood,<br>
Seeking sweet favours for this hateful fool,<br>
I did upbraid her, and fall out with her;
---
## OBERON:
For she his hairy temples then had rounded <br>
With coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers,<br>
And that same dew, which sometime on the buds<br>
Was wont to swell like round and orient pearls,<br>
Stood now within the pretty flowerets’ eyes<br>
Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail. 
---
## OBERON:
When I had at my pleasure taunted her,<br>
And she, in mild terms, begged my patience,<br>
I then did ask of her her changeling child,<br>
Which straight she gave me, and her fairy sent<br>
To bear him to my bower in fairy land.
---
## OBERON:
And now I have the boy, I will undo<br>
This hateful imperfection of her eyes.<br>
And gentle puck, take this transformed scalp<br>
From off the head of this Athenian swain,<br>
That he, awaking when the other do, 
---
## OBERON:
May all to Athens back again repair,<br>
And think no more of this night’s accidents<br>
But as the fierce vexation of a dream.<br>
But first I will release the Fairy Queen.
---
## OBERON:
Be as thou wast wont to be. <br>
See as thou wast wont to see.<br>
Dian’s bud o’er Cupid’s flower<br>
Hath such force and blessed power.<br>
Now, my Titania, wake you, my sweet queen.
---
## TITANIA :
My Oberon, what visions have I seen! <br>
Methought I was enamoured of an ass.
---
## OBERON:
There lies your love.
---
## TITANIA: 
How came these things to pass?<br>
O, how mine eyes do loathe his visage now!
---
## OBERON:
Silence a while. Robin, take off this head.<br>
Titania, music call, and strike more dead <br>
Than common sleep of all these five the sense.
---
## TITANIA:
Music, ho, music, such as charmeth sleep.
---
## OBERON:
Come, my queen, take hands with me,<br>
And rock the ground whereon these sleepers be.<br>
Now thou and I are new in amity,<br>
And will tomorrow midnight solemnly<br>
Dance in Duke Theseus’ house triumphantly,
---
## OBERON:
And bless it to all fair prosperity.<br>
There shall the pairs of faithful lovers be <br>
Wedded, with Theseus, all in jollity.
---
## ROBIN:
Fairy king, attend and mark:<br>
I do hear the morning lark.
---
## TITANIA:
Come, my lord, and in our flight, <br>
Tell me how it came this night<br>
That I sleeping here was found <br>
With these mortals on the ground.
---
## THESEUS:
Go one of you, find out the forester;<br>
For now our observation is performed,<br>
And since we have the vaward of the day,<br>
My love shall hear the music of my hounds. 
---
## THESEUS:
Uncouple in the western valley, let them go.<br>
We will, fair queen, up to the mountain’s top,<br>
And mark the musical confusion<br>
Of hounds and echo in conjunction. 
---
## HIPPOLYTA:
I was with Hercules and Cadmus once<br>
When in a wood of Crete they bayed the bear<br>
With hounds of Sparta. Never did I hear<br>
Such gallant chiding; for besides the groves,
---
## HIPPOLYTA:
The skies, the fountains, every region near<br>
Seemed all one mutual cry. I never heard<br>
So musical a discord, such sweet thunder.
---
## THESEUS:
My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind:<br>
So flewed, so sanded, and their heads are hung<br>
With ears that sweep away the morning dew; <br>
Crook- kneed, and dewlapped like Thessalian bulls,<br>
Slow in pursuit, but matched in mouth like bells,
---
## THESEUS:
Each under each. A cry more tunable<br>
Was never holloed to nor cheered with horn<br>
In Crete, in Sparta, nor in Thessaly. <br>
Judge when you hear. But soft: what nymphs are<br>
these?
---
## EGEUS:
My lord, this my daughter here asleep,<br>
And this Lysander, this Demetrius is,<br>
This Helena, old Nedar’s Helena.<br>
I wonder of their being here together. 
---
## THESEUS:
No doubt they rose up early, to observe<br>
The rite of May; and hearing our intent,<br>
Came here in grace of our solemnity.<br>
But speak, Egeus, is not this the day<br>
That Hermia should give answer of her choice? 
---
## EGEUS:
It is, my lord. 
---
## THESEUS:
Go, bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns. horn sound
---
## THESEUS:
Good morrow, friends. Saint Valentine is past.<br>
Begin these wood- birds but to couple now? <br>
I know you two are rival enemies.<br>
How comes this gentle concord in the world,<br>
That hatred is so far from jealousy<br>
To sleep by hate, and fear no enmity?
---
## LYSANDER:
My lord, I shall reply amazedly, <br>
Half sleep, half waking; but as yet, I swear,<br>
I cannot truly say how I came here.
---
## LYSANDER:
I came with Hermia hither. Our intent <br>
Was to be gone from Athens, where we might<br>
Without the peril of the Athenian law –<br>
---
## EGEUS:
Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough.<br>
I beg the law, the law, upon his head.<br>
They would have stolen away, they would,<br>
Demetrius, 
---
## EGEUS:
Thereby to have defeated you and me:<br>
You of your wife, and me of my consent,<br>
Of my consent that she should be your wife.
---
## DEMETRIUS:
My lord, fair Helen told me of their stealth,<br>
Of this their purpose hither to this wood, <br>
And I in fury hither followed them,<br>
Fair Helena in fancy following me.
---
## DEMETRIUS:
But my good lord, I wot not by what power<br>
(But by some power it is) my love to Hermia,<br>
Melted as the snow, seems to me now<br> 
As the remembrance of an idle gaud,
---
Which in my childhood I did dote upon; <br>
And all the faith, the virtue of my heart, <br>
The object and the pleasure of mine eye, <br>
Is only Helena. To her, my lord, <br>
---
Was I betrothed ere I see Hermia; <br>
But like in sickness did I loathe this food. <br>
But as in health, come to my natural taste, <br>
Now I do wish it, love it, long for it, <br>
And will for evermore be true to it. <br>
---
## THESEUS:
Fair lovers, you are fortunately met. <br>
Of this discourse we more will hear anon. <br>
Egeus, I will overbear your will; <br>
For in the temple, by and by, with us, <br>
---
These couples shall eternally be knit. <br>
Away with us to Athens. Three and three, <br>
We'll hold a feast in great solemnity. <br>
Come. Hippolyta. <br>
---
## DEMETRIUS:
These things seem small and undistinguishable, <br>
Like far-off mountains turned into clouds. <br>
<br>
<br>
## HERMIA:
Methinks I see these things with parted eye, <br>
When everything seems double. <br>
---
## HELENA:
So methinks; <br>
And I have found Demetrius, like a jewel <br>
Not mine own, and mine own. <br>
---
## DEMETRIUS:
Are you sure? <br>
That we are awake? It seems to me <br>
That yet we sleep, we dream. Do not you think <br>
The duke was here, and bid us follow him? <br>
---
## HERMIA:
Yea, and my father. <br>
<br>
<br>
## HELENA:
And Hippolyta.
<br>
<br>
## LYSANDER:
And he did bid us follow to the temple.
---
## DEMETRIUS:
Why then, we are awake. Let's follow him, <br>
And by the way let us recount our dreams. <br>
---
## BOTTOM:
When my cue comes, call me, and I will answer. My next is, 'Most fair Pyramus'. Heigh-ho! 200 Peter Quince? Flute the waiter? Snout the sommelier? Starveling? Gods my life! Stolen hence, and left me asleep? I have had the most rare vision.
---
I have had a dream, past the wit of man to say what dream it was. Man is but an ass if he go about to expound this dream. Methought I was - there is no man can tell what.
---
Methought I was - and me thought I had - but man is but a patched fool if he will offer to say what methought I had. The eye of man hath not heard, the ear of man hath not seen, man's hand is not able to taste, his tongue to conceive, nor his heart to report what my -
---
dream was. I will get Peter Quince to write a ballad of this dream. It shall be called 'Bottom's Dream', because it hath no bottom; and I will sing it in the later end of a play, before the duke. Peradventure, to make it the more gracious, I shall sing it at her death.
---
## QUINCE:
Have you sent to Bottom's house? Is he come home yet?
<br>
<br>
## STARVELING:
He cannot be heard of. Out of doubt he is transported.
<br>
<br>
## FLUTE:
If he come not, then the play is marred. It goes not forward. Doth it?
---
## QUINCE:
It is not possible. You have not a man in all Athens able to discharge Pyramus but he.
<br>
<br>
## FLUTE:
No, he hath simply the best with of any handicraftman in Athens.
---
## QUINCE:
Yea, and the best person too, and he is a very paramour for a sweet voice.
<br>
<br>
## FLUTE:
You must say paragon. A paramour is (God bless us) a thing of naught.
---
## SNUG:
Masters, the duke is coming from the temple, and there is two or three lords and ladies more married.
---
## BOTTOM:
Where are these lads? Where are these hearts?
<br>
<br>
## QUINCE:
Bottom! O most courageous day! O most happy hour!
---
## BOTTOM:
Masters, I am to discourse wonders; but ask me not what. For if I tell you, I am not true Athenian. I will tell you everything right as it fell out.
<br>
<br>
## QUINCE:
Let us hear, sweet Bottom.
---
## BOTTOM:
Not a word of me. All that I will tell you is that the duke hath dined. Get your apparel together: good strings to your beards, new ribands to your pumps. Meet presently at the palace, every man look o'er his part; for the short and the long is, our play is preferred.
---
In any case let Thisbe have clean linen; and let not him that plays the Lion pare his nails, for they shall hang out for the Lion's claws. And most dear actors, eat no onions nor garlic, for we are to utter sweet breath; and I do not doubt but to hear them say, it is a sweet -
---
comedy. Not more words. Away, go away.
---
## HIPPOLYTA:
'Tis strange, my Theseus, that these lovers speak of.
---
## THESEUS:
More strange than true. I never may believe <br>
These antique fables, nor these fairy toys. <br>
Lovers and madmen have such seething brains, <br>
Such shaping fantasies, that apprehend <br>
---
More than cool reason ever comprehends. <br>
The lunatic, the lover, and the poet <br>
Are of imagination all compact. <br>
And as imagination bodies forth <br>
---
The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen <br>
Turns them to shape, and gives to airy nothing <br>
A local habitation and a name. <br>
---
## HIPPOLYTA:
But all the story of the night told over, <br>
And all their minds transfigured so together, <br>
More witnesseth than fancy's images <br>
And grows to something of great constancy, <br>
---
But howsoever strange and admirable. <br>
---
## THESEUS:
Here come the lovers, full of joy and mirth. <br>
Joy, gentle friends, joy and fresh days of love <br>
Accompany your hearts. <br>
---
## LYSANDER:
More than to us <br>
Wait in your royal walks, your board, your bed. <br>
---
## THESEUS:
Come now, what masques, what dances shall we have <br>
To wear away this long age of three hours <br>
Between our after-supper and bed-time? <br>
Where is our usual manager of mirth? <br>
---
What revels are in hand? Is there no play <br>
To ease the anguish of torturing hour? <br>
Call Philostrate. <br>
---
## PHILOSTRATE:
Here, mighty Theseus.
<br>
<br>
## THESEUS:
Say, what abridgement have you for this evening? <br>
What masque, what music? How shall we beguile <br>
The lazy time, if not with some delight? <br>
---
## PHILOSTRATE:
There is a brief how many sports are ripe. <br>
Make choice of which your highness will see first. <br>
---
## THESEUS:
' A tedious brief scene of young Pyramus <br>
And his love Thisbe; very tragical mirth'? <br>
Merry and tragical? Tedious and brief? <br>
That is hot ice and wondrous swarthy snow. <br>
How shall we find the concord of this discord? <br>
---
## PHILOSTRATE:
A play there is, my lord, some ten words long, <br>
Which is as brief as I have known a play. <br>
But by ten words, my lord, is it too long, <br>
Which makes it tedious; for in all the play <br>
There is not one word apt, one player fitted. <br>
---
And tragical, my noble lord, it is, <br>
For Pyramus therein doth kill himself; <br>
Which when I saw rehearsed, I must confess, <br>
Made mine eyes water, but more merry tears <br>
The passion of loud laughter never shed. <br>
---
## THESEUS:
What are they that do play it?
---
## PHILOSTRATE:
Hard-handed men that work in Athens here, <br>
Which never laboured in their minds till now, <br>
And now have toiled their unbreathed memories <br>
With this same play, against your nuptial. <br>
---
## THESEUS:
And we will hear it. <br>
---
## PHILOSTRATE:
No, my noble lord, <br>
It is not for you. I have heard it over, <br>
And it is nothing, nothing in the world, <br>
Unless you can find sport in their intents, <br>
---
Extremely stretched and conned with cruel pain <br>
To do you service. <br>
---
## THESEUS:
I will hear that play; <br>
For never anything can be amiss <br>
When simpleness and duty tender it. <br>
Go bring them in, and take your places, ladies. <br>
---
## HIPPOLYTA:
I love not to see wretchedness o'ercharged, <br>
And duty in his service perishing. <br>
<br>
<br>
## THESEUS:
Why, gentle sweet, you shall see no such thing.
---
## HIPPOLYTA:
He says they can do nothing in this kind. <br>
<br>
<br>
## THESEUS:
The kinder we, to give them thanks for nothing. <br>
Our sport shall be to take what they mistake. <br>
---
## PHILOSTRATE:
So please your grace, the Prologue is addressed.
<br>
<br>
## THESEUS:
Let him approach.
---
## QUINCE:
If we offend, it is with our good will. <br>
That you should think, we come not to offend, <br>
But with good will. To show our simple skill, <br>
That is the true beginning of your end. <br>
---
Consider then, we come but in despite. <br>
We do not come, as minding to content you, <br>
Our true intent is. All for your delight, <br>
We are not here. That you should here repent you, <br>
---
The actors are at hand; and, by their show, <br>
You shall know all, that you are like to know. <br>
---
## THESEUS:
This fellow doth not stand upon points. <br>
<br>
<br>
## LYSANDER:
He hath rid his prologue like a rough colt: he knows not to stop. A good moral, my lord. It is not enough to speak, but to speak true. <br>
---
## HIPPOLYTA:
Indeed, he hath played on this prologue like a child on a recorder: a sound, but not in government. <br>
<br>
<br>
## THESEUS:
His speech was like a tangled chain: nothing impaired, but all disordered. Who is next?
---
## QUINCE:
Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show; <br>
But wonder on, till truth make all things plain. <br>
This man is Pyramus, if you would know. <br>
This beauteous lady Thisbe is certain. <br>
---
This man, with lime and roughcast, doth present <br>
Wall, that vile Wall which did these lovers sunder, <br>
And through Wall's chink, poor souls, they are content <br>
To whisper; at the which, let no man wonder. <br>
---
This man, with lantern, dog and bush of thorn, <br>
Presenteth Moonshine. For if you will know, <br>
By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn <br>
To meet at Ninus' tomb, there, there to woo. <br>
---
This grisly beast, which Lion hight by name, <br>
The trusty Thisbe, coming first by night, <br>
Did scare away, or rather did affright; <br>
And as she fled, her mantle did fall, <br>
---
Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain. <br>
Anon comes Pyramus, sweet youth and tall, <br>
And finds this trusty Thisbe's mantle slain; <br>
Whereat, with blade, with bloody blameful blade, <br>
---
He bravely broached his boiling bloody breast, <br>
And Thisbe, tarrying in mulberry shade, <br>
His dagger drew, and died. For all the rest, <br>
Let Lion, Moonshine, Wall and lovers twain <br>
At large discourse, while here they do remain. <br>
---
## THESEUS:
I wonder if the lion be to speak.
<br>
<br>
## DEMETRIUS:
No wonder, my lord. one lion may, when many asses do.
---
## SNOUT:
In this same interlude it doth befall <br>
That I, one Snout by name, present a Wall; <br>
And such a Wall, as I would have you think, <br>
That had in it a crannied hole or chink, <br>
---
Through which the lovers Pyramus and Thisbe <br>
Did whisper often, very secretly. <br>
This loam, this roughcast and this stone doth show <br>
That I am that same Wall: the truth is so. <br>
---
And this the cranny is, right and sinister, <br>
Through which the fearful lovers are to whisper. <br>
---
## THESEUS:
Would you desire lime and hair to speak better?
<br>
<br>
## DEMETRIUS:
It is the wittiest partition that ever I heard discourse, my lord.
---
## THESEUS:
Pyramus draws near the wall: silence. <br>
---
## BOTTOM:
O grim-looked night, O night, with hue so black, <br>
O night, which ever art when day is not, <br>
O night, O night, alack, alack, alack, <br>
I fear my Thisbe's promise is forgot. <br>
And thou, O Wall, O sweet, O lovely Wall, <br>
That stand’st between her father’s ground and
mine,
---

Thou Wall, O Wall, O sweet and lovely Wall, <br>
Show me thy chink, to blink through with mine eyne.<br>
Thanks, courteous Wall. Jove shield thee well for this.<br>
But what see I? No Thisbe do I see.<br>
O wicked Wall, through whom I see no bliss,<br>
Curst be thy stones for thus deceiving me <br>
---
## THESEUS:
The wall, methinks, being sensible, should <br>
curse again. <br>
---
## BOTTOM:
No, in truth, sir, he should not. ‘Deceiving me’ <br>
is Thisbe’s cue. She is to enter now, and I am to spy <br>
her through the wall. You shall see it will fall. Pat as I told you: <br> yonder she comes <br>
---
## FLUTE:
O Wall, full often hast thou heard my moans<br>
For parting my fair Pyramus and me.<br>
My cherry lips have often kissed thy stones,<br>
Thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee.<br>
---
## BOTTOM:
I see a voice. Now will I to the chink,<br>
To spy and I can hear my Thisbe’s face.<br>
Thisbe?<br>
---
## FLUTE:
My love thou art, my love I think.<br>
---
## BOTTOM:
Think what thou wilt, I am thy lover’s grace; <br>
And like Limander, am I trusty still.<br> 
---
## FLUTE:
And I, like Helen, till the Fates me kill. <br>
---
## BOTTOM:
Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true. <br>
---
## FLUTE:
As Shafalus to Procrus, I to you. <br>
---
## BOTTOM:
O kiss me through the hole of this vile Wall. <br>
---

## FLUTE:
I kiss the Wall’s hole, not your lips at all. <br>
---

## BOTTOM:
Wilt thou at Ninny’s tomb meet me straightway?<br>
---

## FLUTE:
Tide life, tide death, I come without delay.<br>
---

## SNOUT:
Thus have I, Wall, my part discharged so;<br>
And being done, thus Wall away doth go.<br>
--- 

## THESEUS:
Now is the mural down between the two<br>
neighbours.<br>
---
## DEMETRIUS:
No remedy, my lord, when walls are so<br>
wilful, to hear without warning<br>
---
## HIPPOLYTA:
This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard. <br>
---
## THESEUS:
If we imagine no worse of them than they of<br>
themselves, they may pass for excellent men. Here <br>
come two noble beasts, in a man and a lion<br>
---
You ladies, you whose gentle hearts do fear<br>
The smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor,<br>
May now perchance both quake and tremble here,<br>
When Lion rough in wildest rage doth roar. <br>
Then know that I, as Snug the florist, am<br>
No lion fell, nor else no lion’s dam.<br>
For if I should, as Lion, come in strife<br>
Into this place, ’twere pity on my life. <br>
---
## THESEUS:
A very gentle beast, and of a good conscience.<br>
---
## DEMETRIUS:
The very best at a beast, my lord, that e’er I saw. <br>
---
## LYSANDER:
This Lion is a very fox for his valour. <br>
---
## THESEUS:
True, and a goose for his discretion. <br>
---
## DEMETRIUS:
Not so, my lord. For his valour cannot carry<br>
his discretion, and the fox carries the goose.<br>
---
## THESEUS:
His discretion, I am sure, cannot carry his valour,<br>
for the goose carries not the fox. It is well. Leave it to<br>
his discretion, and let us listen to the Moon.<br>
---
## STARVELING:
This lanthorn doth the horned moon present<br>
---
## DEMETRIUS:
He should have worn the horns on his head. <br>
---
## THESEUS:
He is no crescent, and his horns are invisible,<br>
within the circumference. <br>
---
## STARVELING:
This lanthorn doth the horned moon present.<br>
Myself, the man i’th’ moon do seem to be.<br>
---
## THESEUS:
This is the greatest error of all the rest. The <br>
man should be put into the lanthorn; how is it else the<br>
man i’th’ moon?<br>
---
## DEMETRIUS:
He dares not come there for the candle; for<br>
you see, it is already in snuff. <br>
---
## HIPPOLYTA:
I am aweary of this moon. Would he would <br>
change. <br>
---
## THESEUS:
It appears, by his small light of discretion, that<br>
he is in the wane; but yet in courtesy, in all reason, we<br>
must stay the time.<br>
---
## LYSANDER:
Proceed, moon.<br>
---
## STARVELING:
All that I have to say is to tell you that the<br>
lanthorn is the moon, I the man i’th’ moon, this thornbush my thorn- <br>bush, and this dog my dog.<br>
---
## DEMETRIUS:
Why, all these should be in the lanthorn; for all<br>
these are in the moon. But silence: here comes Thisbe. <br>
---
## FLUTE:
This is old Ninny’s tomb. Where is my love?<br>
---
## SNUG:
O. <br>
## DEMETRIUS:
Well roared, Lion.<br>
---
## THESEUS:
Well run, Thisbe.<br>
---
## HIPPOLYTA:
Well shone, Moon. Truly, the Moon shines <br>
with a good grace.<br>
---
## THESEUS:
Well moused, Lion. <br>
---
## DEMETRIUS:
And then came Pyramus. <br>
---
## LYSANDER:
And so the Lion vanished.<br>
---
## BOTTOM:
Sweet Moon, I thank thee for thy sunny beams. <br>
I thank thee, Moon, for shining now so bright.<br>
For by thy gracious, golden, glittering gleams,<br>
I trust to take of truest Thisbe sight.<br>
But stay: O spite!<br>
But mark, poor knight,<br> 
What dreadful dole is here? <br>
---

Eyes, do you see?<br>
How can it be?<br>
O dainty duck, O dear!<br>
Thy mantle good,<br>
What, stained with blood?<br>
Approach, ye Furies fell.<br>
O Fates, come, come,<br>
Cut thread and thrum,<br>
Quail, crush, conclude, and quell. <br>
---
## THESEUS:
This passion, and the death of a dear friend,<br>
would go near to make a man look sad. <br>
---
## HIPPOLYTA:
Beshrew my heart, but I pity the man. 
---
## BOTTOM: 
O wherefore, Nature, didst thou lions frame?<br>
Since Lion vile hath here deflowered my dear. <br>
Which is – no, no, which was – the fairest dame<br>
That lived, that loved, that liked, that looked with<br>
cheer.<br>
Come, tears, confound;<br>
Out, sword, and wound<br>
The pap of Pyramus: <br>
Ay, that left pap,<br>
Where heart doth hop.<br>
---

Thus die I, thus, thus, thus.<br>
Now am I dead,<br>
Now am I fled; <br>
My soul is in the sky.<br>
Tongue, lose thy light<br>
Moon, take thy flight. <br>
Now die, die, die<br>
---
## DEMETRIUS:
No die but an ace for him; for he is but one.<br>
---
## LYSANDER:
Less than an ace, man; for he is dead, he is<br>
nothing. <br>
---
## THESEUS:
With the help of a surgeon, he might yet<br>
recover, and yet prove an ass.<br>
---
## HIPPOLYTA:
How chance Moonshine is gone before <br>
Thisbe comes back and finds her lover?<br>
---
## THESEUS:
She will find him by starlight. Here she comes,<br>
and her passion ends the play. <br>
---
## HIPPOLYTA:
Methinks she should not use a long one for<br>
such a Pyramus. I hope she will be brief. <br>
---
## LYSANDER:
She hath spied him already, with those<br>
sweet eyes. <br>
---
## FLUTE:
Asleep, my love?<br>
What, dead, my dove?<br>
O Pyramus, arise.<br>
Speak, speak. Quite dumb? <br>
Dead, dead? A tomb<br>
Must cover thy sweet eyes.<br>
These lily lips,<br>
This cherry nose,<br>
These yellow cowslip cheeks<br> 
Are gone, are gone:<br>
Lovers make moan.<br>
---
His eyes were green as leeks.<br>
O sisters three,<br>
Come, come to me, <br>
With hands as pale as milk;<br>
Lay them in gore,<br>
Since you have shore<br>
With shears his thread of silk.<br>
Tongue, not a word. <br>
---
Come, trusty sword,<br>
Come, blade, my breast imbrue.<br>
And farewell, friends;<br>
Thus Thisbe ends.<br>
Adieu, adieu, adieu.<br>

---
## THESEUS:
Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead. <br>
---

## DEMETRIUS:
Ay, and Wall too. <br>
---
## BOTTOM:
No, I assure you, the wall is down that parted<br>
their fathers. Will it please you to see the epilogue, or to<br>
hear a Bergomask dance between two of our company? <br>

## THESEUS:
No epilogue, I pray you; for your play needs<br>
no excuse. Never excuse; for when the players are all<br>
dead, there need none to be blamed.<br>
let your epilogue alone. <br>
---
The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve.<br>
Lovers, to bed; ’tis almost fairy time.<br>
I fear we shall outsleep the coming morn,<br>
As much as we this night have overwatched.<br>
This palpable gross play hath well beguiled<br>
---
The heavy gait of night. Sweet friends, to bed.<br>
A fortnight hold we this solemnity, <br>
In nightly revels and new jollity.<br>
---


## ROBIN:
If we shadows have offended,<br>
Think but this, and all is mended:<br>
That you have but slumbered here <br>
While these visions did appear.<br>
And this weak and idle theme<br>
---
No more yielding but a dream,<br>
Gentles, do not reprehend:<br>
If you pardon, we will mend. <br>
And as I am an honest puck,<br>
If we have unearned luck<br>
---
Now to scape the serpent’s tongue,<br>
We will make amends ere long;<br>
Else the puck a liar call. <br>
So, good night unto you all.<br>
Give me your hands, if we be friends;<br>
---
And Robin shall restore amends.<br>
