# Packaging the Extension for Distribution

## What You Now Have

Your extension now works in **two modes**:

1. **Zero-config mode**: Anyone can use it with just a `.md` file - no template directory needed!
2. **Advanced mode**: Power users (like you) can still use custom `template/` directories

## Quick Package Steps

### 1. Install the packaging tool (one-time)

```bash
npm install -g @vscode/vsce
```

### 2. Navigate and compile

```bash
cd vscode-extension
npm install
npm run compile
```

### 3. Package it!

```bash
vsce package
```

This creates: `remark-preview-0.1.0.vsix`

## What to Share

### Minimum (Just the Extension)

Share the `.vsix` file with these instructions:

**Installation:**
1. Open VS Code
2. Extensions ‚Üí `...` menu ‚Üí "Install from VSIX..."
3. Select the `.vsix` file
4. Done!

**Usage:**
1. Create a `.md` file
2. Press `Cmd+Shift+V` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+V` (Windows)

### Recommended (Complete Package)

Create a folder with:

```
remark-preview-package/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ remark-preview-0.1.0.vsix
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ INSTALL.txt (simple instructions)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README-SIMPLE.md (beginner guide)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ example-presentation.md (copy from resources/)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ screenshots/ (optional - show what it looks like)
```

## Testing Before Distribution

1. **Package it** (see above)

2. **Install in VS Code**:
   - Extensions ‚Üí Install from VSIX
   - Choose your `.vsix` file

3. **Test with no template directory**:
   - Create a new folder (empty except for a `.md` file)
   - Open in VS Code
   - Create a simple `.md` file
   - Press `Cmd+Shift+V`
   - Should work with default styles!

4. **Test with template directory**:
   - Use your existing captionpoint-plays folder
   - Open a `.md` file
   - Press `Cmd+Shift+V`
   - Should use your custom templates!

## Simple Install Instructions for Recipients

Create a file called `INSTALL.txt`:

```

## What Makes This Beginner-Friendly

The extension now:

‚úÖ **Works immediately** - No template directory required
‚úÖ **Has beautiful defaults** - Professional-looking presentations out of the box
‚úÖ **Uses CDN for Remark.js** - No need to download libraries
‚úÖ **Gives clear errors** - Helpful messages if something's wrong
‚úÖ **Fallbacks gracefully** - If custom templates fail, uses defaults

## For Your Advanced Users

They can still create a `template/` directory and customize:

```
their-project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ template/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ style.scss (custom styles)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html (custom template)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ font/ (custom fonts)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ presentation.md
```

The extension automatically detects and uses it!

## Version History

When you make updates:

1. Update version in `package.json`:
   ```json
   "version": "0.2.0"
   ```

2. Add a `CHANGELOG.md`:
   ```markdown
   # Changelog

   ## [0.2.0] - 2024-XX-XX
   ### Added
   - New feature here

   ### Fixed
   - Bug fix here

   ## [0.1.0] - 2024-XX-XX
   - Initial release
   ```

3. Repackage:
   ```bash
   npm run compile
   vsce package
   ```

## Optional: Publish to Marketplace

Want to make it publicly available in VS Code's extension marketplace?

1. **Create publisher account**: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage

2. **Get Personal Access Token** from Azure DevOps

3. **Login**:
   ```bash
   vsce login your-publisher-name
   ```

4. **Publish**:
   ```bash
   vsce publish
   ```

Now anyone can install it directly from VS Code without downloading files!

## Troubleshooting Package Creation

### "WARNING: Missing publisher name"

Add to `package.json`:
```json
"publisher": "your-name-here"
```

### "WARNING: Missing repository"

Either add to `package.json`:
```json
"repository": {
  "type": "git",
  "url": "https://github.com/yourusername/remark-preview"
}
```

Or ignore - it's just a warning, not an error.

### Package is too large

Check what's included:
```bash
vsce ls
```

Make sure `node_modules/` is excluded in `.vscodeignore`

## What's Included in the Package

The `.vsix` contains:

- ‚úÖ Compiled JavaScript (`out/` folder)
- ‚úÖ Default template HTML
- ‚úÖ Default styles CSS
- ‚úÖ Example presentation
- ‚úÖ Dependencies (sass, etc.)
- ‚ùå Source TypeScript files (excluded)
- ‚ùå Development files (excluded)
