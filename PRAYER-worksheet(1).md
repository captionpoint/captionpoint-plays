## PATRICK:
My father owns a piano store, on Rue du Faubourg Montmartre. 

---


the fifth – and last – generation to run the place. Pianos Salomon – 

---

that’s our family name, Salomon – was founded by my great- great-great-grandfather in 1855. 

---

Owning a piano used to be something you strived for, 

---

a sign you’d made it to the middle class, 

---

but it doesn’t hold the same appeal anymore. 

---

Most days my father sits in an empty store, 

---

an old man waiting for customers who almost never show. 

---

He’s in his late eighties, but he won’t give the place up. 

---

Sometimes, a friend will ask how come my sister and I don’t take over the business. 


---

Five generations! All that history! 

---

Think of what the store has seen – and survived! 

---

But it’s not how either of us want to spend our time, and besides, 

---

you can’t support a family selling pianos, not really. 

---

This is a Salomon original. Our name’s on the fallboard. 

---

They used to manufacture them, Papa only sells them now. 

---

This one belongs to Marcelle…I’d say let’s start at the beginning, 

---

but what’s the beginning of a family? 

---

We’ve been in France more than a thousand years. 

---

So let’s start here: it’s early fall. It’s late afternoon, sixteen years into the twenty- first century. 

---

My sister’s welcoming a distant American cousin of ours into her home, 

---

in the heart of Paris. 


---

## MARCELLE:

So my great-grandmother, Irma, was sisters with your great-great-grandmother, Lucie. 


---

They were born in the east, in Strasbourg, then moved west, to remain French, 

---

when Alsace–Lorraine became German for about fifty years. 

---

Then Lucie left France, and went to America, but she stayed in touch, 

---

very close, with her sister Irma, and then Lucie had a daughter in New York, 

---

whose name escapes me but who is your great- grandmother, 

---

and Irma had a son in Lille, named Lucien, who was my grandfather, 

---

and they were cousins, and then your grandmother Renee was born, 

---

and my grandfather had Pierre, who is my father, 

---

and so I am cousins with your mother, and you are cousins with my children.

---

## MOLLY:

Right. Say that again?

---

## MARCELLE:

We’ll go backwards. You are cousins with my children. 

---

I am cousins with your mother.

## MOLLY:

Right.

---

## MARCELLE:

My father is Pierre, your grandmother is Renee, 

---

and they are cousins.

## MOLLY:

OK.

---

## MARCELLE:

And their grandmothers were Irma and Lucie, and they were sisters. 

---

That’s the connection.

## MOLLY:

In Strasbourg.

---

## MARCELLE:

First Strasbourg, then Lille, then Paris. You follow me?

---

## MOLLY:

Yes. No. Sort of.

---

## MARCELLE:

The details are not important. 


---

## MOLLY:

Basically, we’re cousins.

## MARCELLE:

We’re cousins.

---

## MOLLY:

But not first cousins?

## MARCELLE:

No. No. 

---

Uh… I don’t know how it works, exactly? 

---

Third cousins? Fourth? It’s distant, but…

---

## MOLLY:

Yeah I don’t really get the whole cousin thing.

---

## MARCELLE:

We share blood. We both descend from the man who founded Pianos Salomon. 

---

See? That’s our name there. This was my great-grandmother’s.

---

## MOLLY:

I thought your name was uhm, Ben, Ben uhm…

---

## MARCELLE:

Benhamou, yes, that’s my married name, my maiden name is Salomon.

---

## MOLLY:

Uh huh.

---

## MARCELLE:

I can try to explain it in English, if you prefer –

## MOLLY:

No, please. Just French. I’m trying, 

---

I want to get as fluent as I can.

## MARCELLE:

You speak very well, I have to say.

---

## MOLLY:

Thank you. I feel like, I have such a long way to go, but –

---

## MARCELLE:

No, your French is very good.

## MOLLY:

Thank you. 

---

In school, they made us choose: French or Spanish, but my mom was like, 

---

“There’s no choice in this family: you’re taking French.” 

---

Everyone still fancies themselves, uhm, very French, 

---

even though no one on my side of the family has been, uh, French for, uh, a hundred years.

---

## MARCELLE:

And you’re here for a year? 

## MOLLY:

A school year, yeah.

---

## MARCELLE:

In Nantes?

## MOLLY:

Yeah. It’s like, two hours from here, by train?

---

## MARCELLE:

I know where Nantes is.

## MOLLY:

Right. Of course. Sorry.

---

## MARCELLE:

You didn’t want to study in Paris?

---

## MOLLY:

I did but my school – they don’t really encourage it.

## MARCELLE:

Why not?

---

## MOLLY:

I think they’re trying to break the whole entitled Americans in Paris thing. 

---

My parents didn’t want me to come to France at all, but…

## MARCELLE:

Why not?

---

## MOLLY:

Just cause of all the, you know. The terrorism.

---

## MARCELLE:

There’s terrorism everywhere.

---

## MOLLY:

That’s what I said, but they were scared. 

---

## MARCELLE:

Aren’t you from New York? What’s to be scared? 

## MOLLY:

I agree.

---

## MARCELLE:

The whole world has terrorism now. There’s nowhere to hide. 

---

Either you live in the world, or you live in a cave. 

---

Personally, I don’t want to be a caveman.

---

## MOLLY:

Exactly. But, they felt better if I was in a smaller city. 

---

And it’s nice, totally in… 

---

My host family is kind of… uhm, what’s the word I want? 

---

They’re not racist, but…

## MARCELLE:

Uh huh.

---

## MOLLY:

They’re not racist. But, at the same time, 

---

I have to live with them for a year, so I need to just…

---

So my Mom said, why don’t you visit our family in Paris, 

---

which, I didn’t really know we had, I knew my 
nana wrote letters to France, 

---

I guess to your mother, right?

---

## MARCELLE:

No. To Philippe and Francine. 

## MOLLY:

Oh.

---

## MARCELLE:

My father’s cousins. They got out before the war.

## MOLLY:

Oh OK.

---

## MARCELLE:

But Francine is dead. And Philippe’s in Switzerland now, 

---

most of the time, so he asked if I would –

## MOLLY:

But you stayed in France, during the war? 

---

## MARCELLE:

I was not born before World War II. 

---

## MOLLY:

Oh.

---

## MARCELLE:

I’m not that old.

## MOLLY:

Oh, I’m sorry, I didn’t –

---

## MARCELLE:

But yes, my family stayed.

---

## MOLLY:

Wow. It’s so… it’s unbelievable, to have French family.

---

---

## MARCELLE:

So you will make yourself at home. Come and go as you please this weekend.

---

## MOLLY:

Thank you.

## MARCELLE:

I’m not usually home this early, but I’m moving offices, 

---

and they’re painting today, so… 

## MOLLY:

What do you do?

---

## MARCELLE:

I’m a doctor, now a professor, and after three completely inept department heads, 

---

they finally realized, “Oh. Maybe a woman can run this department.” 

---

Hence, the new office.

## MOLLY:

Congratulations.

---

## MARCELLE:

Thank you. So you will have dinner with us tonight?

---

## MOLLY:

Sure, yes, thank you.

---

## MARCELLE:

We are not strict here, but traditional, so…

---

## MOLLY:

I don’t… I don’t follow.

---

## MARCELLE:

We’re traditional. You know. We light the candles, Shabbat dinner, you know.

---

## MOLLY:

I still don’t…

---

## MARCELLE:

Shabbat. You don’t understand me. Shabbat?

---

## MOLLY:

Do you mean, like, Shabbat?

---

## MARCELLE:

Yes. Shabbat. 

## MOLLY:

Ohhhh. OK.

---

## MARCELLE:

Do you keep Shabbat?

## MOLLY:

Uhm, no, no I don’t. 

---

But I’m not really, you know…

## MARCELLE:

Not what?

---

## MOLLY:

I wasn’t, I mean, I wasn’t raised with any religion…

---

## MARCELLE:

But you’re Jewish, no?

## MOLLY:

I guess technically? 

---

But I don’t believe in organized religion, 

---

I actually think if we could, uhm, end all religions immediately 

---

we might have a chance at saving our planet but I, 

---

I totally respect if you want to. Believe. It’s just, not for me. 

---

## MARCELLE:

Well. Welcome. 

---

Elodie? You want to say hello to our American cousin? This is Molly.

---

## ELODIE:

Hello.

## MOLLY:

Nice to meet you!

---

## MARCELLE:

Elodie is quite… tired.

## MOLLY:

Yeah.

---

## MARCELLE:

She’s not – very tired.

---

## MOLLY:

It’s such a pretty name, Elodie.

---

## MARCELLE:

Yes, it is. Excuse me, I need to check on dinner.

---

## MOLLY:

OK. So, is there, uhm – am I OK, to come to, whatever, like this?

---

## MARCELLE:

Yes, you’re dressed fine. It’s just dinner, here. Just us. We’re just traditional.

---

## MOLLY:

Right. What does that mean?

---

## MARCELLE:

We keep the traditions. My son is a little more religious, but we – 

---

I myself, my brother and I were raised almost with nothing. 

---

But, this is to be expected, after the war, many Jews just…

---

Then I met my husband. I wasn’t looking for a Jewish husband, 

---

this was irrelevant for me at the time, but we met, 

---

we fell in love, despite our differences, and – 

## MOLLY:

Differences?

---

## MARCELLE:

Well he is Sephardic, he comes from – his family is from Algeria.

---

## MOLLY:

Really! 

## MARCELLE:

Yes, really. 

---

## MOLLY:

That’s interesting.

---

## MARCELLE:

Most Jews in France today, the vast majority, their roots are North African. It’s very common.

---

## MOLLY:

I didn’t know that.

## MARCELLE:

Yes.

---

## MOLLY:

Why is that?

---

## MARCELLE:

They came in the 60s.

## MOLLY:

Why?

---

## MARCELLE:

Because. It stopped being safe. Many, many centuries they lived there, 

---

and then…Anyway. 

---

The sofa is very comfortable, no one complains.

---

## MOLLY:

It’s great. I’m already, so comfortable.

---

## MARCELLE:

I’m sorry I don’t have a spare bedroom to offer but –

---

## MOLLY:

This is fine!

---

## MARCELLE:

I did not think, at this point in my life I would still have a full house, but –

---

## MOLLY:

This is fine. This is – Thank you. 

---

## CHARLES:

Marcelle?

---

## MARCELLE:

I’m in the kitchen.

---

Oh my god! Daniel what happened –

---

## DANIEL:

I’m fine, I’m –

## MARCELLE:

What happened? Look at you.

---

## CHARLES:

He got beat up.

## MARCELLE:

You were what?

---

## CHARLES:

I just saw him outside, stumbling into the apartment.

---

## MARCELLE:

This happened outside? 

## DANIEL:

No, in Sarcelles. I’m OK. 

---

## MARCELLE:

Are you OK?

## DANIEL:

I’m OK.

---

## MARCELLE:

What did the police do? 

## DANIEL:

I didn’t, I didn’t see the police. 

---

## MARCELLE:

You didn’t go to the police? 

## DANIEL:

No –

---

## MARCELLE:

Call the police. 

## DANIEL:

No! Don’t call the police. 

---

## MARCELLE:

I’m calling the police!

## DANIEL:

DO NOT call the police. No. I don’t want to –

---

## MARCELLE:

Why can’t we call the police?

## DANIEL:

Because Mom, not now. I just need to –

---

## MARCELLE:

Who did this to you?

## CHARLES:

Who do you think! 

---

## ELODIE:

What’s happening? 

## MARCELLE:

Your brother got beat up. 

---

## ELODIE:

What?

## DANIEL:

They just roughed me up a little.

---

## MARCELLE:

This is what we call roughed up? Did they break your nose?

---

## DANIEL:

Ow.

## MARCELLE:

Let’s go to the hospital.

---

## CHARLES:

Let me look at him.

## MARCELLE:

But don’t you think we should take him to the hospital?

---

## DANIEL:

I don’t need to go to the hospital, nothing’s broken I –

---

## CHARLES:

Sit down, let me see, let me take a look. 

## MARCELLE:

Wait, not on the sofa you’re all bloody. 

---

## CHARLES:

Not on the sofa! Who cares about the sofa! 

## MARCELLE:

Because not on the sofa! 

---

## CHARLES:

Oh for God’s sake, fine, let’s go to the bathroom.

---

## MARCELLE:

How do you know you don’t need to go to the hospital?

---

## DANIEL:

Because I didn’t break anything.

## MARCELLE:

How do you know?

---

## DANIEL:

I can tell.

---

## CHARLES:

Marcelle, can I take a look at him? 

## MARCELLE:

You’re not an orthopedic surgeon. 

---

## CHARLES:

I’m a doctor.

## MARCELLE:

So am I!

---

## CHARLES:

You’re a psychiatrist, can I take a look at him?

## MARCELLE:

So take a look at him! Who’s stopping you?

---

## CHARLES:

Sit down, son. Can you sit?

## DANIEL:

Yeah I can sit.

---

## ELODIE:

What happened?

---

## DANIEL:

I was leaving school, I was walking to the metro, 

---

these three guys came up and

## CHARLES:

Sit still stop moving.

---

## MARCELLE:

How many times have I begged you to wear a baseball cap?

---

## CHARLES:

Sit still. started saying, “Hey Jew, fuckin Jew,” things like that. 

## MARCELLE:

Why do you do this,

---

## DANIEL:

I’m not going to change my behavior because there are bigots in the world, I’m not –

---

## DANIEL:

I didn’t say anything but they kept following me and then before I knew what was happening they started – 

---

## MARCELLE:
why do you insist on putting yourself in harm’s way for no reason! 

---

## DANIEL:

There’s no reason! Because I don’t want to wear a baseball cap I –

---

## MARCELLE:

Listen to yourself! Are you even listening to yourself, what you’re saying!

---

## ELODIE:

Can you let him finish? What happened?

---

## DANIEL:

They followed me, they grabbed me, they punched me, a few times.

---

## MARCELLE:

A few times! 

## DANIEL:

A few times. That was it. 

---

## MARCELLE:

That was it!

## DANIEL:

It really wasn’t a big deal –

---

## MARCELLE:

Not a big deal! No, it’s perfectly normal to get punched in the face on a Friday afternoon, 

---

walking to the metro, that’s perfectly normal –

---

## CHARLES:

Does that hurt? 

## DANIEL:

No, I told you, I’m fine –

---

## CHARLES:

How about that? How’s that feel? 

## DANIEL:

It’s sore when you press on it, but – 

---

## MARCELLE:

Sore! Oh my god!

## CHARLES:

Marcelle you need to relax or I’m going to…

---

## MARCELLE:

Going to what?

## CHARLES:

Just, calm down.

---

## MARCELLE:

OK fine! I’ll calm down! I’ll calm down! 

---

Great! Fine! Fine! Great! I’m calming down! 

---

Let’s all calm down while my son bleeds to death in the bathroom.

---

## CHARLES:

Marcelle. Make a little space. Take a step back. OK?

---

Nothing seems broken to me.

## DANIEL:

I know.

---

## MARCELLE:

I’m gonna call the police.

## DANIEL:

Mom! Stop!

---

## ELODIE:

Why should she stop?

## MARCELLE:

Why should I stop? 

---

Reporting a crime, is a crime now?

---

## DANIEL:

I didn’t even get a good look at them, it happened so fast.

---

## MARCELLE:

This never happened until you started dressing like this. 

---

You never had a problem before. 

## CHARLES:

Stop yelling at the boy –

---

## MARCELLE:

You put a huge target on your back! Here I am! Here I am!

---

Now is not the moment to walk around with a sign that says 

---

“Here I Am” on your back it’s not the time!

---

## DANIEL:

The sun is setting.

## MARCELLE:

Now is not the – what?

---

## DANIEL:

The sun is setting.

## MARCELLE:

You’re covered in blood. 

---

## DANIEL:

I’m not covered – 

## MARCELLE:

You’re covered –

---

## CHARLES:

He’s OK. He didn’t break anything. It’s just a little –

## DANIEL:

Everyone! Enough! Please. 

---

Can we please light the candles before the sun goes down? Please?

---

## CHARLES:

Are you Marcelle’s cousin?

## MOLLY:

Hi, yes, I’m Molly?

---

## CHARLES:

Welcome.

## MOLLY:

Thanks. 

---

---

## MARCELLE:

Baruch atah Adonai, Eloheinu melech ha’olam, 

---

asher kid’shanu b’mitzvotav, v’tzivanu l’hadlik ner shel Shabbat.

---

## CHARLES:

Gut shabbes.

## MARCELLE:

Yeah. 

---

You must have been so scared. Let me call the police, OK?

---

## DANIEL:

Mom. No.

## MARCELLE:

But sweetie, why?

---

## DANIEL:

Because.

## MARCELLE:

Because why?

---

## DANIEL:

Because I don’t want – 

I’ve seen what happens – 

---

Everyone… you’re not just a person anymore, you become this thing, 

---

who’s been through something. Even if it’s not…My students are already on edge. 

---

I don’t want to be the reason they feel even more insecure. 

---

And besides. I really didn’t get a good look. I wouldn’t even be able to describe them. 

---

So they’d write it up, it’d be in the news, and then it’s all anyone would 

---

talk about but that’s not what I… and then even then, after all that, 

---

it wouldn’t change a thing, so there’s no point. 

---

## MARCELLE:

But you don’t think, it’s important, for them to keep track of things like this?

---

## DANIEL:

I’m not doing it. So.

## CHARLES:

Do you want to – 

---

does he have time to get cleaned up, before dinner?

---

## MARCELLE:

He has time of course he has –

## CHARLES:

Do you want to take a shower, wash off? 

---

I think you’ll feel better.

## DANIEL:

Yeah. OK.

---

## MARCELLE:

That’s a good idea.

## DANIEL:

But honestly? And I mean this… 

---

I’m done talking about this tonight. OK?

---

## MARCELLE:

We have to talk to him, we have to talk to him tonight, this stops now, this stops tonight –

---

## CHARLES:

Maybe this isn’t the moment to have this conversation –

---

## MARCELLE:

He wants to dress like a maniac? In the house, be my guest. But when he goes outside, it stops.

---

## CHARLES:

And how do you propose we enforce that? He’s twenty-six years old –

---

## MARCELLE:

We just do! Then he can’t live here if he’s going to… 

---

Where is his – Why can’t he be private? 

---

Religion is not something to advertise, that’s not how we – 

---

He wasn’t raised that way, he –

---

## ELODIE:

Don’t you think it’s a problem, that a person can’t go outside 

---

wearing something on his head for fear of being attacked? 


---

## MARCELLE:

Of course it’s a problem but you don’t solve a problem 

---

by exacerbating a problem that’s not how you solve a problem.

---

## ELODIE:

So how do you propose solving this problem?

---

## MARCELLE:

And you certainly don’t do it in neighborhoods where you know 

---

there’s a high risk of being attacked. Then you’re just asking for it.

---

## ELODIE:

Oh so Daniel’s asking for it now? Is that seriously your argument? He’s asking for it?

---

## MARCELLE:

Elodie, I am so not in the mood for your shit tonight.

---

## CHARLES:

Let’s all just stop it please! Just stop it! I can’t even think. 

---

Please. Let’s get dinner on the table, OK? 

---

Let’s have dinner. Let’s have – Let’s have dinner.

---

## MOLLY:

I – I don’t know if I mentioned, I’m a vegetarian?

---

[music]

---

## PATRICK:

More than seventy years earlier, in 1944, on the other side of Paris, 

---

in a modest apartment on the Boulevard Beaumarchais, 

---

an elderly couple sit down to a meal. 

---

## PATRICK:

These are my great-grandparents. Their names are Irma and Adolphe. 

---

It’s their piano Marcelle inherited. Which is fine. I’m not bitter. 

---

The story goes, the SS sent someone to arrest them, 

---

but their building’s super grabbed him and said, 

---

“What are you doing, it’s old people, leave them alone.” 

---

And he did. He left, and Irma and Adolphe spent the war 

---

in their apartment in Paris, untouched. 

---

They have three grown children. 

---

Jacqueline got out with her family before the war and fled to Cuba. 

---

But Robert was arrested in ’42, Lucien in ’43, 

---

along with his wife and three children. 

---

There’s no mail service, no telegrams, no phone calls. 

---

For the last year, Irma and Adolphe haven’t heard a word about their children. 

---

They know nothing. And I know almost nothing about them. 

---

I didn’t ask questions as a kid. I know just a handful of details: 

---

They were first cousins – people married their cousins in those days. 

---

I know Adolphe was nearly blind, and Irma had won first prize 

---

at a piano conservatory when she was young. 

---

I know they’d tried to make it in America, but couldn’t scrounge up any work, 

---

so they came back to France and took over the family business. 

---

But these are just facts. What were they like, as people? 

---

Papa had just one anecdote: When he was little, Irma would butter his bread, 

---

then scrape her knife against his piece of bread to get butter for hers. 

---

She’d survived World War I, the Great Depression. 

---

She’d learned to economize. 
And this stayed with me for a long time. 

---

To think – all anyone remembers when you’re gone is this tiny gesture, 

---

this trick you taught yourself, when you were one small person 

---

facing the giant forces of history.What did they talk about? 

---

I have to imagine it was hard not to talk about their children, their grandchildren…

---

## IRMA:

We don’t talk about our children that much.

---

ADOLPHE:

Oh?

## IRMA:

We don’t. 

---

ADOLPHE:

Irma. 

## IRMA:

What?

---

ADOLPHE:

That’s not entirely the truth.

---

## IRMA:

Well, of course, I talk about them sometimes. They’re my children.

---

## PATRICK:

Where do you think they are?

---

## IRMA:

Somewhere safe, I hope.

ADOLPHE:

We don’t know, we really don’t.

---

## IRMA:

Jacqueline and her family went to Cuba, before they stopped letting people out. 

---

Of course, Max begged Lucien to go with them –

---

ADOLPHE:

Irma, don’t –

## IRMA:

I’m just explaining, 

---

because Lucien had the piano business, 

---

his money was all in those pianos, he couldn’t just leave 

---

but if he had gone to Cuba when they begged him –

---

ADOLPHE:

I can’t rehash this again, I can’t – 

## IRMA:

Because they begged him, 

---

Jacqueline begged him –

ADOLPHE:

Irma –

---

## IRMA:

Max said he could get them visas, Max said he could –

ADOLPHE:

Irma please.

---

## IRMA:

If they had gone to Cuba, they’d be celebrating Pierre’s – 

---

you know it’s his fourteenth birthday today – 

---

they’d be celebrating at… maybe at the beach! 

---

Maybe at the beach!

ADOLPHE:

Please stop, darling. Please.

---

## IRMA:

Maybe in the ocean! Doesn’t that sound marvelous? To turn fourteen in the ocean, in Cuba? 

---

Then they could all get together, the whole family, 

---

all the cousins and have birthday cake with Pierre. In Havana.

---

ADOLPHE:

Even when they all lived in Paris they didn’t celebrate birthdays together.

---

## IRMA:

Sometimes they did.

ADOLPHE:

They never did. 

---

They fought too much. And I assure you: if they were in Havana, they would be fighting still.

---

## IRMA:

You don’t know that.

ADOLPHE:

I know.

---

## IRMA:

It was an idea. 

ADOLPHE:

It’s a fantasy. 

---

## IRMA:

So what?

ADOLPHE:

Alright.

---

## IRMA:

They won’t forget to celebrate his birthday, will they?

---

ADOLPHE:

I know as much as you.

## IRMA:

But what are they doing for his birthday?

---

ADOLPHE:

I don’t know! 

## IRMA:

But how are they celebrating?

---

ADOLPHE:

I don’t know how they’re celebrating!

## IRMA:

Fine! Forget it.

---

ADOLPHE:

I don’t know where they are!

## IRMA:

I said, forget it. 

---

ADOLPHE:

For all I know – 

## IRMA:

Forget! It!

---

ADOLPHE:

They are in a small apartment, somewhere in the mountains. 

---

After they were arrested, they spent a few nights in Paris, 

---

then they got away and went to the mountains. 

---

Somewhere safe. That’s where they are.

---

## IRMA:

In the mountains.

ADOLPHE:

Yes. 

---

It’s very beautiful where they are. And Lucien’s found work tuning pianos.

---

## IRMA:

He has?

ADOLPHE:

Yes. He tunes pianos. 

---

There’s a music school nearby, so he has a lot of work. 

---

And the school even has a few Salomon pianos, so he goes to work, 

---

he tunes the pianos, he sees our name and thinks of us, and all our stores all over France.

---

## IRMA:

Twenty-two stores, Adolphe.

---

ADOLPHE:

Twenty-two stores. 

---

And as he tunes them, he thinks about how one day, he will teach his son to run the stores, 

---

then Pierre will take over and the stores will go on forever.

---

## IRMA:

They will. 

---

ADOLPHE:

And Eva has taken in some sewing, so between the two of them, 

---

they’re getting by. It’s cold in the mountains, but they’re fine. 

---

And the children are in school, they’re doing well, even Colette.

---

## IRMA:

OK, that I don’t believe. Colette’s sweet but…

---

ADOLPHE:

Well, she’s taking her studies seriously, for once. 

---

And this morning Pierre woke in their apartment in the mountains and turned fourteen. 

---

Eva saved her rations to bake him a cake, it isn’t very sweet, 

---

there isn’t much sugar, but he has a cake, 

---

and Lucien bought him a Swiss Army knife so that when 

---

he’s in the woods hiking with his friends if he needs to cut through 

---

a rope or whatever boys do at that age, 

---

he will have a little knife in his pocket he can take out.

---

## IRMA:

And Robert is… Robert is alright too.

---

ADOLPHE:

He’s alright. He’s… working for France. Making buttons.

## IRMA:

Buttons?

---

ADOLPHE:

When the war is over, France will give him a medal.

---

## IRMA:

They already gave him a medal, for the Great War.

---

ADOLPHE:

Well now he will have two. 

---

And our children will come home, we’ll all be together, and everyone will get along beautifully.

---

[They Laugh]

---

## IRMA:

That’s funny.

ADOLPHE:

It’s your fantasy…

---

## IRMA:

No, they’ll come home, after about ten minutes they’ll start arguing, 

---

and I’ll yell, “Robert! Please! You haven’t seen your brother in four years!” 

---

ADOLPHE:

Then Jacqueline will encourage Colette not to take a second piece of cake, 

---

Colette will start to cry, Eva will ask what happened and she’ll say Aunt Jacqueline called me fat, 

---

and Eva will say don’t you call my daughter fat don’t you dare 

---

and Jacqueline will say I never said she was fat 

---

I just know she’s been unhappy with her weight I was trying to encourage her, 

---

then Eva will storm off and you’ll have to console Jacqueline because she’ll be quite upset 

---

and she’ll say I try and I try but no matter what I do it’s never right it’s never enough I give up. 

---

And that’s how the reunion will go.

---

[They Laugh]

## IRMA:

I can’t wait.

---

[music]

---

## CHARLES:

What do you want me to say? What?

---

## MARCELLE:

Twice is not an accident. Twice is not bad luck. Twice is insane. 

---

## CHARLES:

So our son’s insane. So he’s insane. So then what? 

---

What do you want to do? Badger the boy into submission? 

---

It’s not gonna work! It’s not Marcelle, so –

---

## MARCELLE:

Shhh, enough!

---

## DANIEL:

Excuse me.

## MOLLY:

Oh it’s OK.

---

## DANIEL:

I was just, getting some water. I didn’t mean to disturb you.

---

## MOLLY:

You’re not. I’m just, reading.It’s… embarrassing.

---

## DANIEL:

Ernest Hemingway? Why is that embarrassing?

---

## MOLLY:

For an American, to come to Paris and read A Moveable Feast? It’s a cliché.

---

## DANIEL:

Uh, don’t, uh – Don’t tell?

## MOLLY:

Don’t tell?

---

## DANIEL:

That I was, just now, uhm… standing, listening.

---

## MOLLY:

Oh, I won’t. I do that, too, when my parents are fighting. 

---

Or, talking. I didn’t mean to say your parents were…

---

## DANIEL:

I think it’s universal.

---

## MOLLY:

Yeah.

---

Does it hurt?

---

## DANIEL:

A little. But don’t tell my mother?

---

## MOLLY:

Maybe – do you have, uhm, a steak or something?

---

## DANIEL:

A steak?

---

## MOLLY:

Isn’t that what they do in movies? After a fight?

---

## DANIEL:

Oh yeah! I’ve seen that in movies.

---

## MOLLY:

Right?

## DANIEL:

Does it work? 

---

## MOLLY:

It works in movies. 

## DANIEL:

I’m OK.

---

## MOLLY:

It’s happened before, to you?

## DANIEL:

Not like this.

---

## MOLLY:

But it’s happened? What was the –

---

## DANIEL:

So you’re here for a year?

## MOLLY:

What? Oh, yeah. 

---

## DANIEL:

To learn French? 

---

## MOLLY:

I know French, I – 

## DANIEL:

Yes, you speak well.

---

## MOLLY:

Thank you. But I want to get better.

## DANIEL:

Why?

---

## MOLLY:

I don’t know. I also… wanted to leave school for a while? 

---

I kind of had a uh, a pretty bad break up last semester? And I needed some, uhm, distance. 


---

## DANIEL:

Oh. He sounds like a real jerk.

---

## MOLLY:

Oh, no he… 

## DANIEL:

He must be a real – 

---

## MOLLY:

No. It was a she.

## DANIEL:

Oh.

---

## MOLLY:

I’m sorry, that’s totally a lie, I don’t know why I said that. 

---

It’s a he, it’s definitely a he.

## DANIEL:

OK.

---

## MOLLY:

I just… I’m not the kind of person who, who makes decisions because some guy broke my heart, 

---

but then I made this big decision because some guy broke my heart 

---

and I’m kind of embarrassed. By myself – 

---

can I start over? I came to France because I wanted to learn French.

---

## DANIEL:

So you’re not a lesbian?

## MOLLY:

No. No. Not that – 

---

I mean, if I met the right girl, I try to be openminded…

---

## DANIEL:

So you’re maybe a lesbian?

---

## MOLLY:

Sorry. I need to just – no. I am not a lesbian.

---

## DANIEL:

I’m gonna get some water.

## MOLLY:

Uh huh.

---

[sound of running water in sink]

---

Oh. Thank you.

## DANIEL:

You’re welcome.

---

## MOLLY:

Thanks. It’s so nice of your parents, to host me. And your sister seems… sweet.

---

## DANIEL:

Well she’s very brilliant. She’s a very brilliant person.

---

## MOLLY:

How long have you two lived here?

---

## DANIEL:

In this apartment? Our whole lives.

## MOLLY:

Oh wow, 

---

so you never – you always lived with your parents?

---

## DANIEL:

Oh, no. I left for school, but when I started teaching in Sarcelles, 

---

my parents didn’t want me to live there, but I couldn’t afford my own place here, so –

---

## MOLLY:

Why didn’t they want you to live in…

---

## DANIEL:

They thought it was dangerous.

## MOLLY:

Is it?

---

## DANIEL:

It’s OK. You know, some people moved away, but, that’s their choice.

---

## MOLLY:

Why did they move?

## DANIEL:

It’s complicated.

---

## MOLLY:

What happened? 

---

## DANIEL:

Well. There’s been, you know, attacks before and, but then last year, 

---

maybe you heard about the shooting at Charlie Hebdo, the newspaper? 

---

And then they went to this kosher supermarket in Paris 

---

and killed four Jews who were, just shopping for groceries. 

---

So the people took to the streets to march for peace, millions of people. 

---

But Netanyahu came and told all the Jews to come to Israel, 

---

but then Manuel Valls got up and he said –

---

## MOLLY:

Who?

## DANIEL:

Our Prime Minister, Manuel Valls, he said something like, 

---

if 100,000 Frenchmen of Spanish origin left, France would still be France 

---

but if 100,000 French Jews left, France would no longer be France. 

---

The French Republic would be judged a failure. 

---

And, I mean, 100,000 Jews definitely did not leave last year, only around 8,000? 

---

Which is the most in a single year to leave France in a long time. 

---

So. It’s a thing. But some of the people who moved away were teachers, 

---

so the school needs teachers cause the kids can’t really go to public school anymore, but… 


---

and I like the students. they’re really cool.

---

## MOLLY:

What do you teach?

---

## DANIEL:

Can’t you tell?

## MOLLY:

Uhm, I don’t know. Jewish stuff?

---

## DANIEL:

No. It’s – it’s a Jewish school, everyone is Jewish.

## MOLLY:

Oh.

---

## DANIEL:

Math. I teach math.

## MOLLY:

Really?

---

## DANIEL:

Yes, why, do I not seem geeky enough to be a math teacher?

---

## MOLLY:

No, you do, it’s just – 

## DANIEL:

Oh. So I’m geeky? Thank you. 

---

## MOLLY:

Sorry. I didn’t mean it like that. 

## DANIEL:

I’m just teasing.

---

## MOLLY:

Oh. OK. How, how did you get to be so religious?

---

## DANIEL:

I’m not so religious.

---

## MOLLY:

I mean, you teach in a Jewish school, you wear…

---

## DANIEL:

Uh huh.

## MOLLY:

It’s… interesting. To me. 

---

## DANIEL:

OK. 

## MOLLY:

What?

---

## DANIEL:

Nothing.

## MOLLY:

What? Why are you, laughing at me?

---

## DANIEL:

I’m not.

## MOLLY:

You are.

---

## DANIEL:

Look, I really respect you Molly, I do. But I can tell you think I’m, uh, 

---

pretty ridiculous, actually, to say the least, so –

---

## MOLLY:

I never said you were ridiculous! 

## DANIEL:

But I can tell that’s what you think, so – 

---

## MOLLY:

You have no idea what I think.

## DANIEL:

OK.

---

## MOLLY:

You don’t, you don’t even know me. You have no idea how I feel.

---

## DANIEL:

Then how do you feel?

## MOLLY:

You have no idea. And you have no right to assume… 

---

## DANIEL:

So tell me: how do you feel?

## MOLLY:

About what?

---

## DANIEL:

About people like me. About religious Jews. About Jews.

---

## MOLLY:

I feel… Don’t turn this around on me, I was asking you –

---

## DANIEL:

OK.

## MOLLY:

Because I’m, I’m of Jewish extraction, OK, so I don’t –

---

## DANIEL:

Of Jewish extraction. Wow.

## MOLLY:

I am.

---

## DANIEL:

No, I – I believe you it’s just, such a disdainful way of referring to yourself but –

---

## MOLLY:

Excuse me?

## DANIEL:

I said, it’s a disdainful way of referring to yourself.

---

## MOLLY:

It’s not. It’s accurate.

---

## DANIEL:

Right. OK. Hey, I’m gonna go to bed now.

## MOLLY:

Did I – are you upset?

---

## DANIEL:

Yeah. A little. Yeah.

## MOLLY:

OK… I don’t – OK.

---

## DANIEL:

I – I actually have a fair amount of, uh, experience with people like you, in my life.

---

## MOLLY:

Oh do you?

## DANIEL:

I do. 

---

And in my experience, people who say things like, of Jewish extraction, 

---

are actually more dogmatic about religion than religious people, so I try to avoid the subject 

---

with those who clearly have disdain for – me. 

## MOLLY:

Uhm. Wow. OK. 

---

Well, I’d say it sounds like you actually have disdain for me, but…

---

## DANIEL:

I don’t.

## MOLLY:

Well that’s not how it sounds to me.

---

## DANIEL:

OK.

## MOLLY:

OK. Well. Good night, Daniel.

---

## DANIEL:

I upset you. 

## MOLLY:

Yes. You did. 

---

## DANIEL:

I apologize. 

## MOLLY:

OK.

---

## DANIEL:

That was not my intention. I apologize. Genuinely.

---

## MOLLY:

Maybe, you know, maybe it’s people like you who’ve made it impossible for me to feel proud of who I am.

---

## DANIEL:

Maybe it is.

## MOLLY:

It’s people like you who take territory that isn’t yours –

---

## DANIEL:

I haven’t taken any territory – 

## MOLLY:

And build settlements – 

---

## DANIEL:

Molly –

## MOLLY:

And force people off land that is rightfully –

---

## DANIEL:

Molly!

## MOLLY:

What?

---

## DANIEL:

I don’t want to talk about Israel. 

---

## MOLLY:

OK. Then why are you standing here. 

## DANIEL:

I was just trying to get to know you. 

---

## MOLLY:

And I was trying to get to know you. 

---

I came to you, very genuinely, with an open – 

---

and then you turned it around and made all these assumptions 

---

when you don’t, you don’t even know me.

---

## DANIEL:

I’m sorry.

## MOLLY:

I was just asking how you became religious. 

---

That was all I wanted to know. If you didn’t want to tell me, you don’t have to, 

---

but you don’t have to be, uhm…

## DANIEL:

I’m sorry.

---

## MOLLY:

OK.

---

## DANIEL:

I guess it was a few years ago now, there was one winter, it didn’t snow. 

---

It just did not snow. 

---

And people kept talking about climate change and global warming, 

---

so it was on my mind, but also, I love winter. 

---

And to be in Paris when it snows… it doesn’t get old, at least, not to me. 

---

But this one winter, no snow. December, January, February. 

---

Nothing. Finally, it’s the first week of March, 

---

I’m walking to the metro… I feel flurries. It was too warm for anything to stick, 

---

but still – flurries. And I felt… grateful: to be alive, 

---

to have grown up at a time when I really got to experience winter. 

---

I wanted to say thank you, but who do you thank for the snow? 

---

So I went to synagogue, and I prayed, and, I liked it, so I kept going. 

---

And I’m – I’m still figuring out how I feel about, 

---

you know, God but, I believe in the Earth. 

---

That feels close enough. 

---

You think I’m ridiculous?

## MOLLY:

No. I don’t. 


---

## DANIEL:

I feel a little ridiculous. Talking about the snow, and –

---

## MOLLY:

Well you shouldn’t.

## DANIEL:

I shouldn’t?

---

## MOLLY:

No. It’s actually… 

---

## DANIEL:

Oh. I was just getting… water. 

---

## CHARLES:

OK. How are you feeling? 

## DANIEL:

I’m OK.

---

## CHARLES:

OK. I’ll, I’ll take a look in the morning.

---

## DANIEL:

OK. Thanks.

## CHARLES:

Yep.

---

## DANIEL:

You must be tired.

## MOLLY:

Yeah.

---

## DANIEL:

OK, well, have a good – water.

---

MALE VOICE:

[music]

## MARCELLE:

Elodie? It’s time to get up.

---

## ELODIE:

I’m sleeping.

---

## MARCELLE:

It’s almost noon, we don’t sleep all day. Elodie. Elodie! 


---

## ELODIE:

Five minutes!

---

## MARCELLE:

Five minutes. But then I want you up and out of bed, OK? OK?

---

## ELODIE:

Okayyyyyy!

---

## MARCELLE:

Elodie? Is this your wine glass you left here? Elodie?

---

## ELODIE:

Stop!

---

## MARCELLE:

Do you have a personal maid I don’t know about?

---

[Elodie grumbles and clanks the glass loudly]

---

## ELODIE:

Happy?

---

## MARCELLE:

So who has the honor now of putting it in the dishwasher? 

---

You leave it in the sink and now, what, the magic dishwashing fairy will take care of it? 

---

I work hard all week, while you lie around doing God knows what – 

---

Do I look like a magic dishwashing fairy to you?

---

## ELODIE:

No. You look like a bitch.

---

## MARCELLE:

Yes I’m a bitch for not wanting to clean up after you.

---

## ELODIE:

I was gonna clean it up, relax! It was bothering you so much? 

---

## MARCELLE:

Yes! It’s my house! I like it neat, Farida is not here on the weekends, 

---

even if she were she’s not your personal maid.

---

## ELODIE:

I cleaned it up can you not yell this early in the –

---

## MARCELLE:

Early? I already ran five kilometers! And shopped! Responded to fifty emails –

---

## ELODIE:

Can you not yell.

---

## MARCELLE:

You want to leave your wine glasses out all over the place, get your own apartment. 

---

You want to live in my home, clean up after yourself.

---

## ELODIE:

Got. It.

---

## MARCELLE:

And you don’t sleep the whole day away!

## ELODIE:

Oh my god what do you care?

---

## MARCELLE:

Because. We’re not doing that anymore. 

---

We are not – you will sit down, 

---

I just got you some – and you will eat something.

---

## ELODIE:

I’m. Not. Hungry.

## MARCELLE:

I. Don’t. Care.

---

## ELODIE:

I’m not hungry! I’m twenty-eight years old I know when I’m hungry, I’m not hungry!

---

## MARCELLE:

Then you will sit with Molly while she eats. Where is she?

---

## ELODIE:

How the fuck should I know?

## MARCELLE:

Elodie. 

---

She’s still in the bathroom. 

---

## ELODIE:

OK.

---

## MARCELLE:

She was in the bathroom when I left.

## ELODIE:

Are you keeping tabs?

---

## MARCELLE:

No I’m not keeping tabs, thank you.

---

These are fresh, would you like one?

---

## ELODIE:

No thank you.

---

## MARCELLE:

Elodie.

---

## ELODIE:

OK sure, thank you.

---

---

## MARCELLE:

Your father walked in on Molly and your brother last night.

---

## ELODIE:

Uch! Really? 

## MARCELLE:

Mmm hmmm. 

---

## ELODIE:

Where?

## MARCELLE:

Right there.

---

## ELODIE:

Daniel had sex in our living room?

---

## MARCELLE:

What? No!

## ELODIE:

Then what…

---

## MARCELLE:

They were in there, in the dark. On the couch together.

---

## ELODIE:

What do you mean, together, like – 

## MARCELLE:

On the couch. Sitting very close together. 

---

## ELODIE:

Were they doing anything?

---

## MARCELLE:

I don’t know. 

---

## ELODIE:

Mom. When two people are sitting together, 

---

and somebody else enters the room, you don’t say that 

---

they walked in on them. That’s not, that’s not how that works.

---

## MARCELLE:

You don’t find it a little uncomfortable, this cousin you’ve never met, 

---

the first night she’s here and suddenly she’s putting the moves on your brother?

---

## ELODIE:

Was she putting the moves on him?

## MARCELLE:

I don’t know. Maybe. 

---

Sweetie?

## ELODIE:

Yes Mom.

---

## MARCELLE:

I need your help.

## ELODIE:

With what?

---

## MARCELLE:

Don’t say it like that. 

## ELODIE:

With what? 

---

## MARCELLE:

Forget it.

## ELODIE:

What!

---

## MARCELLE:

Talk to your brother. 

---

## ELODIE:

What am I supposed to do? 

## MARCELLE:

He worships you.

---

## ELODIE:

Um, OK.

## MARCELLE:

Even just a baseball cap, something to cover his – 

---

if you could get him to – explain that, it’s okay – 

---

in a dangerous world, self-preservation is not incidental –

---

## ELODIE:

You should just say something if you feel so strongly. 

---

## MARCELLE:

I have. Believe me I have. You know I have. He doesn’t listen. He would listen to you.

---

## ELODIE:

I doubt that.

---

## MARCELLE:

Will you at least – will you think about it? Elodie?

---

## ELODIE:

Yeah, I’ll think about it. 

---

## MARCELLE:

It would mean a lot to me. 

## ELODIE:

OK.

---

## MARCELLE:

Aren’t you hungry?

## ELODIE:

No. 

---

## MARCELLE:

No? 

## ELODIE:

No.

---

## MARCELLE:

But you had a lot to drink last night?

---

## ELODIE:

Mom. I had two glasses of wine.

---

## MARCELLE:

The bottle was empty.

---

## ELODIE:

Because there were five of us. We shared one bottle of wine. 

---

As a family. Eating dinner. What are you even talking about?

---

## MARCELLE:

I don’t like you drinking.

## ELODIE:

I had two glasses of wine! 

---

I do not have a drinking problem! I had two –

---

## MARCELLE:

I didn’t say you had a drinking problem, all I said –

## ELODIE:

Two. With dinner. 

---

Two glasses of wine does not make someone an alcoholic!

---

## MARCELLE:

I never said you were an alcoholic – 

---

## ELODIE:

A manic depressive episode is not the same thing as alcoholism, 

---

I would think you of all people would know that –

---

## MARCELLE:

An episode doesn’t last two years Elodie!

## ELODIE:

It can!

---

## MARCELLE:

When left untreated! When not properly treated! 

---

But when you drink all night and then sleep all day, that’s not –

---

## ELODIE:

I HAD TWO GLASSES OF WINE! WITHDINNER! 

---

That does not qualify as drinking all night! 

---

When two people are talking, you don’t say you walked in on them. 

---

And when a person has a glass of wine with dinner, you don’t say they’re an alcoholic.

---

## MARCELLE:

Not a glass. Two. Two. Two glasses.

---

## ELODIE:

OH MY GOD! You sound INSANE right now.

---

## MARCELLE:

Fine. I’m insane. You’re right Elodie. You know what? 

---

Why don’t you go back to bed. It’s only noon, after all, 

---

you’re missing out on at least another six good hours of sleep before –

---

[Door slams]

---

## MOLLY:

Excuse me.

---

---

## MARCELLE:

Have you eaten?

## MOLLY:

Oh, no, not yet. 


---

## MARCELLE:

We have bread, croissants, there’s cereal…

---

## MOLLY:

Can I, could I have a croissant?

---

## MARCELLE:

Please. Why don’t you join Elodie. She was just about to eat.

---

## MOLLY:

They’re warm.

## MARCELLE:

Yes, they’re fresh.

---

## MOLLY:

Oh my Goooooood. Where did you get these? 

---

## MARCELLE:

Down the street. 

---

## MOLLY:

I love this country.

---

Sorry, I just, I have never had anything this, uhm, good before? In my entire life?

---

## MARCELLE:

Well then. 

---

Elodie. I’m opening the window, in case you want to take a shower. It’s all steamed up.

---

## MOLLY:

Oh. I’m sor– I’m sorry. Is there anything I can…

---

## MARCELLE:

No. I just opened the window. 

---

## MOLLY:

I, I guess I was in there longer than I… I’m sorry. 

---

I am so embarrassed. My French mother doesn’t let me take long showers, 

---

so…Do you think she’s mad, that I was in the bathroom too long?

---

## ELODIE:

Yes.

## MOLLY:

Really?

---

## ELODIE:

Yes.

## MOLLY:

Oh.

---

## DANIEL:

Hey.

## MOLLY:

Hi.

---

## MARCELLE:

How were services?

## DANIEL:

Very nice.

---

## MOLLY:

Oh, you went to –

---

## MARCELLE:

If you want lunch, help yourself but I just got some croissants –

---

## DANIEL:

OK, thanks.

## MARCELLE:

Charles? Are you hungry? Charles?

---


Are you OK? Are you –

## CHARLES:

I think I – I need to sit.

---

## MARCELLE:

Charles?

## CHARLES:

I can’t… I can’t get oxygen.

---

## ELODIE:

Are you having a panic attack?

## CHARLES:

I…

---

## MARCELLE:

Breathe. Just breathe. In through your nose, out through your mouth. 

---

In through your nose. Out through your –What happened?

---

## DANIEL:

Nothing. We were just walking. He was quiet, but –

---

## CHARLES:

I can’t do this anymore.

## MARCELLE:

Just breathe.

---

## CHARLES:

I can’t, I can’t do this anymore.

## MARCELLE:

Do what, honey?

---

## CHARLES:

Live. Here. I can’t live here anymore. I can’t do it.

---

## MARCELLE:

What? Oh. OK well this can wait.

## CHARLES:

I’m done waiting. 

---

## MARCELLE:

Just breathe. Just – 

## CHARLES:

I want to move.

---

## MARCELLE:

In through your nose – 

## CHARLES:

I want to move.

---

## MARCELLE:

Charles I’m not really in the mood for this again –

---

## ELODIE:

Mom, he’s trying to express something. Don’t shut him down.

---

## CHARLES:

You’re never in the mood, but now, I’m in the mood.

---

## MARCELLE:

You want to move?

## CHARLES:

I want to move.

---

## MARCELLE:

And where would you like to go?

## CHARLES:

Israel. 

---

## MARCELLE:

Israel. 

## CHARLES:

Yes.

---

## MARCELLE:

OK. Great choice. Do you speak Hebrew?

## CHARLES:

I’ll learn.

---

## MARCELLE:

You’ll learn. Sounds easy. Do you have a job lined up?

---

## ELODIE:

You don’t have to be so snotty –

## CHARLES:

I’ll find one.

---

## MARCELLE:

What luck! A new job in a foreign language –

## ELODIE:

Mom!

---

## CHARLES:

I can’t do this anymore. OK? I cannot – 

---

I walked beside our son this morning, all the way to synagogue… 

---

the looks he got, the way some people looked at him –

---

## MARCELLE:

And we have been over this, a thousand times. 

---

If he did not, so overtly, display his religious identity, 

---

this would not be a problem –

---

## DANIEL:

I don’t want to wear some stupid baseball cap – 


---

## MARCELLE:

Yes God forbid you take any precautions –

---

## CHARLES:

It’s not about a baseball cap, Marcelle. 

---

The issue is not how Daniel dresses, don’t you see? 

---

He could cover up, he could never leave the house again, 

---

it wouldn’t change the fact that this is how people feel. 

---

We know it. We know it because when given the chance, they express it. 

---

Our son’s been attacked twice now. 

---

He can’t walk down the street without people staring at him, glaring at him, menacingly –

---

## MARCELLE:

Maybe they were staring because his face is swollen. 

---

Did you think about that?

## CHARLES:

I don’t think that’s the case –

---

## MARCELLE:

Because if I saw that on the street, I’d stare too.

---

## ELODIE:

Mom! Listen to what Dad is saying! Can you just listen?

---

## CHARLES:

I walked with my son, down the streets of Paris, to synagogue. 

---

And I saw the faces. And then we sat, and prayed. 

---

They read the Torah, they read the Haftorah, and then the Rabbi 

---

asked us to rise, so we could say the Prayer for the French Republic. 


---

A prayer which I have said – how many times? 

---

But it never hit me – until today, the weight of it. 


---

Every week they say it, every week for two hundred years, 

---

through Dreyfus, through Vichy, every generation, even when… and frankly, 

---

I’m tired of praying for someone else to protect me. I’m tired of it. 

---

And, to be totally honest, I don’t think it’s working –

---

## MARCELLE:

That’s because you don’t believe in praying, you don’t believe in God, what are you talking about –

---

## CHARLES:

I’m talking about the prayer I said this morning.

---

## MARCELLE:

Since when do you put stock in prayers?

---

## CHARLES:

That’s what I’m saying! They’re – they’re stabbing Jews in Strasbourg. 

---

They’re stabbing Jews in Marseille. They’re – 


---

## MARCELLE:

Uh, they’re stabbing Jews in Israel, too.

---

## CHARLES:

Yes but in Israel, our son could walk down the street, 

---

in Haifa, in Tel Aviv, and not fear for his life.

---

## DANIEL:

I don’t fear for my life.

---

## CHARLES:

Well I do! I’m tired of seeing armed guards outside every school, 

---

every synagogue – carrying machine guns – MACHINE GUNS!?! 

---

Why are we not safe here? Why are we in danger?

---

## MARCELLE:

So your solution is to move to Israel? 

---

Honey, do you need me to buy you a newspaper? 

---

You feel unsafe, so you want to move to Israel?

---

## CHARLES:

At least in Israel, we’re all unsafe. We’re equally unsafe.

---

## MARCELLE:

I think we’re pretty equally unsafe right here in Paris. 

---

Did you forget about the Bataclan? About –

---

## CHARLES:

No I did not forget about the Bataclan, but, it’s not the same, the – 

---

the terrorists may hate the French, but they hate us most of all. 

---

And they hate us on the right, and they hate us on the left. They hate us here.

---

## MARCELLE:

News flash: they hate us everywhere. 

---

They don’t hate us less in other countries, in fact –

---

## CHARLES:

And it’s getting worse. The writing is on the wall – 

---

I. Can’t. Do it anymore. I can’t. I want to move to Israel.

---

## MARCELLE:

OK. Well, I don’t.

---

## CHARLES:

I, I… you’re not hearing me.

---

## MARCELLE:

What am I not hearing?

---

## CHARLES:

I won’t live here anymore. I am moving to Israel. I want us to move to Israel.

---

## MOLLY:

Uhmmm. 
I would just say uhm… before you make any decisions, 

---

if I could maybe share some information, or articles, because – 

---

I know it can be sensitive, words get tossed around 

---

which isn’t always helpful – settlements, and human rights violations, 

---

and uhm, I’m not sure what the word is in French, maybe it’s the same – apartheid? 

---

But when you listen to the stories, of what’s happening over there, 

---

it can change how you think about things, I know it did for me, so. 

---

I’m just putting that out there. In case that’s helpful.

---

## ELODIE:

Yes that’s very helpful. Thank you Molly.

## MOLLY:

Sure.

---

## ELODIE:

I had no idea Israel’s occupation of Palestine was so problematic. 

---

Thank you so much for that.

## MOLLY:

OK.

---

## ELODIE:

Did you guys have any idea Israel was such a problematic nation?

## DANIEL:

Elodie.

---

## ELODIE:

I’m curious, how’d you come to learn so much about this?

## DANIEL:

OK, OK, enough.

---

## ELODIE:

I’m just asking a question. 

## MOLLY:

I, I educated myself. I read. 

---

## ELODIE:

You read.

## MOLLY:

I read.

---

## ELODIE:

Books, articles?

## MOLLY:

Yes.

---

## CHARLES:

Let’s quit while we’re ahead, shall we? 

---

## ELODIE:

No it’s just so interesting to me because I’m also a student of history, I’m curious.

---

## MARCELLE:

You’re not curious.

## ELODIE:

Did you happen to read said articles on your laptop?

---

## CHARLES:

No laptop.

## MARCELLE:

You made your point.	

---

Oh No. No laptop today. You made your point.

---

## ELODIE:

Because as I’m sure you already know, laptops are full of coltan, 

---

the mining of which has wreaked utter devastation on African environments.

---

## MARCELLE:

If I have to hear about coltan one more time, no one cares about coltan! 

---

## ELODIE:

That’s the problem! We don’t care who has to DIE so we can play Candy Crush! Which is just like Molly!

---

## DANIEL:

You own a phone! You own a laptop!

---

## ELODIE:

No I’m just trying to understand, when you first learned about Israeli occupation, 


---

were you in your little pink bedroom on the Upper East Side?

---

## MOLLY:

If, if you’re asking if I am aware of the flaws, 

---

the major flaws of my own country: yes, I’m very aware.

---

## ELODIE:

You’re aware! She’s aware! We can all relax, she’s aware!

---

## MOLLY:

And I don’t disagree, the history of America is, horrifying, but it’s not –

---

## ELODIE:

But it’s not so awful that you plan to do anything about it. 

---

Midtown Manhattan is not your motherland, 

---

yet you feel totally justified sitting on your stolen land, 

---

educating yourself about human rights violations on your phone 

---

made of stolen minerals, dug by slave labor, 

---

and then standing up with no irony whatsoever and saying: 

---

“I Decry Occupation!” I mean… So Brave. 


---

## CHARLES:

I think you’ve made your point.

---

## ELODIE:

Or are you actually concerned with occupation, 

---

cause, you know you could start by leaving YOUR occupied lands?

---

## MARCELLE:

Why don’t you leave? I’m so sorry Molly.

---

## MOLLY:

But, all countries have done wrong. America. Uhm. Germany…

---

## ELODIE:

Uh huh…

---

## MOLLY:

And, and Israel also needs to be held to, you know, the –

---

## ELODIE:

There it is! I was wondering how long I’d have to wait 

---

for the Israeli–Nazi comparisons, but it’s right on time!

---

## CHARLES:

You made your point!

---

## ELODIE:

No I’ve had it with this shit. 

---

I will not be lectured to about what we should do, so we feel safe, 

---

by someone who gets to sleep as soundly as she does every night 

---

in her bedroom built over a pile of other people’s BLOOD and GUTS. 

---

And I will not just sit here, mealy mouthed while she’s just 

---

putting it out there for us, like we’re morons, 

---

when she’s got more blood on her hands than anyone.

---

## DANIEL:

She does not have blood on her hands!

---

## ELODIE:

Look at those bloody fucking hands! 

---

And you’re still living on the Upper East Side, aren’t you? 

---

Aren’t you! Aren’t you!

---

## MARCELLE:

Molly, I’m so sorry, Elodie suffers from manic depression.

---

## ELODIE:

Oh thanks Mom! Yes, Molly, this is gonna shock you 

---

but I have a mental health problem. 


---

I’m sure you had no idea there was anything wrong with me.

---

## MARCELLE:

Elodie go to your room. 


---

## ELODIE:

I’m not seven.

---

## MOLLY:

No it’s – I actually wanted to see some museums today, so –

---

## MARCELLE:

You do not need to go –

---

## MOLLY:

No it’s totally fine, I’ll be back, uhm –

## DANIEL:

Molly –

---

## MOLLY:

I’ll be back later.

---

## DANIEL:

You really don’t have to go. Molly.

---

## MOLLY:

No, it’s OK, it’s OK. This is what happens. 

---

All I did was try to point out some injustice might be taking place, 

---

and your immediate response is to deflect, and call me a hypocrite. 

---

Just for speaking. What are you so afraid of?

---

## ELODIE:

Don’t talk to me about injustice, I’m the Queen of standing up against injustice! The queen!

---

## MARCELLE:

Yeah, you’re the queen alright.

---

## ELODIE:

All I do is stand up against injustice!

---

## MARCELLE:

Where? In your bed? On your computer?

---

To your five little friends no one cares about?

---

## ELODIE:

I will never understand how you are a person 

---

people seek for compassionate treatment.

---

## MARCELLE:

Elodie you have said enough for one day, OK?

---

You’ve used up your word count.

---

## ELODIE:

You don’t get to dictate my word count – 

---

## CHARLES:

Your mother’s right. It’s enough out of you. 

---

## ELODIE:

Jesus Christ! 


---

## MARCELLE:

Is Molly OK?

---

## DANIEL:

Uh, not really. You really, uh, did not need to take it that far.

---

## ELODIE:

Oh I’m sorry, were you enjoying that guest lecture on Israeli policy?

---

## DANIEL:

That’s not the point, she’s a guest and now she’s… 

---

## ELODIE:

I don’t know, when my guests start saying – 

---

## MARCELLE:

Elodie! Elodie! Enough.

---

## ELODIE:

Fine. Mom thinks you fucked Molly in the 
living room last night, 

---

although even if you did I think after that anti- Zionist display 

---

the rose is off that bloom, also Mom says you worship me 

---

so I should tell you to wear a baseball cap 

---
 

## DANIEL:

For the love of God will everyone please stop telling me how to dress!

---

but personally I think you should dress however the fuck you want.
 

---

## MARCELLE:

Elodie! Elodie! Enough!I never said that. 

---

## DANIEL:

Thank you Elodie.
 
 


---

## MARCELLE:

Charles. Do something.

---

## CHARLES:

I am. I did.

---

## MARCELLE:

What?

---

## CHARLES:

I want to move to Israel, I said – 

---

## MARCELLE:

I meant do something now, here, now. 

---

## CHARLES:

That’s what I’m trying to do!

---

## MARCELLE:

Very good, well I’m done talking about Israel for today. 

## CHARLES:

Well I’m not.

---

## ELODIE:

Why are people in this family only allowed to talk if you agree with what they have to say?

---

## CHARLES:

Can I just –

## MARCELLE:

I’m done responding to you.

---

## ELODIE:

You silence anyone who isn’t saying something  

## MARCELLE: 
Everyone Ignore Elodie!

---

## ELODIE:

you want to hear –

## CHARLES:

Can I - 

---

## CHARLES:

I’m trying to speak!!! 

## ELODIE:

Dad is trying to speak. 

---

## MARCELLE:

So who’s stopping you? 

CHARLES & ELODIE:

You!

---

## MARCELLE:

Well I can’t listen to more of your, I walked down the street, 

---

I heard a prayer, I want to leave. I can’t listen to that, OK? 

---

Our lives are here. They’re here. We live here. 

---

You have a practice, I run a department. We have a home. 

---

Our children live here. All our friends. My father – 

---

and his needs are only growing, and we all know my brother is 

---

never going to step up and take responsibility for the 

---

overseeing of his care, which means, I need to be here. 

---

So let’s say you decided, in a burst of romanticism, 

---

that you had to live by the sea, and we should move to Normandy, 

---

or Biarritz, or Antibes – we couldn’t do it. 

---

We’re too young to retire and we’re too old to start over, 

---

even in our own country. We have too many obligations. 

---

So it’s not just impractical, it’s impossible, and frankly –

---

## CHARLES:

I’m scared.

---

I’m scared, Marcelle. You lay everything out, you lay it out so rationally, 

---

and I hear every word you’re saying, but, I’m scared. 

---

We are Jews. We are Jews. The only reason we’re still on this planet 

---

is because we learned to get out of dangerous situations 

---

before they got the better of us. Something is happening in the world, 

---

and it’s happening in our country, too – I can feel it. 

---

I feel it when I walk with Daniel, I feel it when I read the left wing editorials, 

---

I feel it watching Le Pen and her base, all stirred up. 

---

Something is happening, and when that thing comes, 

---

I don’t want to have to pray so my own country will protect me from it.

---

---

## IRMA:

Adolphe! Adolphe! My god, Adolphe!

---

## CHARLES:

Is it rational? Maybe not.

## IRMA:

Adolphe?

---

## CHARLES:

Is it practical? Absolutely not.

## IRMA:

Adolphe!

---

ADOLPHE:

What is it? What? 

---

## CHARLES:

But my heart – 

## IRMA:

It’s news.

---

## CHARLES:

My gut.

## IRMA:

Lucien!

---

## CHARLES:

Every bone in my body, every inch of my core –

## IRMA:

And Pierre!

---

## CHARLES:

Is telling me the same thing:

## MARCELLE:

And what is that? 


---

## IRMA:

They’re coming home!

## CHARLES:

Run.

---

ACT TWO

---

[music]

---

[singing and playing piano]
## PATRICK:

I TOOK A TRIP ON A TRAIN AND I THOUGHT ABOUT YOU 

---

I PASSED A SHADOWY LANE AND I THOUGHT ABOUT YOU

---

TWO OR THREE CARS PARKED UNDER THE STARS WINDING STREAM

---

MOON SHINING DOWN ON SOME LITTLE TOWN 

---

AND WITH EACH BEAM, THE SAME OLD DREAM

---

 …Let’s talk about the Crusades, shall we? 

---

Jews are living in France for centuries when – in 1096 – 

---

the People’s Crusade rolls into town. This is before the official Crusades, 

---

which were led by the Catholic church. This one was just for the people. 

---

Estimates vary, but they managed to kill about a third of France’s Jews, 

---

so, not too shabby! Now. The People’s Crusade was led by 

---

someone named Peter the Hermit. He was nice. 

---

He and his buddies would come to town, do some torturing, 

---

a little dragging around, a little killing, then pile the bodies up 

---

until they couldn’t pile them any higher, and let me tell you, 

---

when you get to the point where you can’t pile anymore dead bodies up, 

---

you’ve made some pretty impressive piles! But to be fair, 

---

a lot of Jews committed suicide to avoid being killed, 

---

so technically you can’t blame Peter the Hermit for everything. 


---

We know about this because someone wrote it down. 

---

A Jew whose name has been lost to history wrote 

---

something called the Mainz Anonymous. That’s the thing about Jews, 

---

we write it all down. Look, if we didn’t keep track of it, 

---

you think they’d keep track of it for us?

---

The Mainz Anonymous is a great read, I have to say, I highly recommend it. 

---

Here’s how someone named Isaac son of Daniel died:

---

“They put a rope around his neck and dragged him through 

---

the entire city in the muddy streets to the house of their idolatry. 

---

There was still some life in his frame when they said to him: 

---

‘You can still be saved if you agree to change your religion.’ 

---

Having already been strangled, he could not utter a word from his mouth, 

---

so he gestured with his finger to say: ‘Cut off my head.’ 

---

And they slit his throat.” 

---

Sorry, was that too much? I forget what it’s like, the first time you hear the details…

---

[singing and playing again]
I TOOK A TRIP ON A TRAIN AND I THOUGHT ABOUT YOU 

---

I PASSED A SHADOWY LANE AND I THOUGHT ABOUT YOU

---

Truth be told, I didn’t know all this growing up. 

---

Mom wasn’t Jewish, Dad wasn’t religious. 

---

Other than weddings and funerals, we didn’t do too much with religion. 

---

We just wanted to be French. And we are! 


---

But then Marcelle married who she married, 

---

their children became who they became, and every year they got a little more…

---

I mean, the idea that France isn’t safe? France! 

---

The first country in Europe to emancipate its Jews? 

---

The country our family loved so much that, in 1870 

---

when Germany annexed the region where they had lived for centuries, they moved! 


---

Went west, to remain French, that’s how much they loved it 

---

and it must have broken their hearts – because Strasbourg is fucking gorgeous. 

---

I was there on business actually, not too long ago. 

---

Gorgeous. Cobblestone streets, nice shopping – 

---

I had a little time to kill before my train back to Paris, 

---

so I was strolling around, buying a couple things, before you know it, 

---

I’m on Jew Street – which I assure you is a totally benign name

---

you see in lots of cities here that means, 

---

“Street where Jews live – lived,” 

---

and out of the corner of my eye, I see a faded stone plaque on the side of a building: 

---

“In this section was the center of the medieval Jewish community, 

---

prior to the massacre of 1349.” Who knew? 

---

Turns out 2,000 people were killed – burned alive – 

---

during what’s affectionately known as the Valentine’s Day massacre, 

---

cause they were a little more humane that day, they spared the children. 

---

And also women they found attractive, so, that’s something.

---

Do I descend from survivors of this massacre? 

---

My family lived in this area for centuries, 

---

they spared the attractive women and, well, look at us: we’re gorgeous. 

---

But no one ever talked about it. What would they have said?

---

It was the middle of the night. She was a pretty young mother. 

---

She held her tiny baby to her breast as she 

---

watched her husband being burned alive. 

---

She thought she could make out his scream but so many were screaming, 

---

it was hard to know which was his, and to be fair, 

---

she’d never heard him make a sound like that before. 


---

Who wants to hear that story. So they didn’t talk about it. 

---

Or maybe they talked about it for a while, 

---

then something else horrible happened, and it was forgotten. 

---

That’s how history works. I mean, what is history, 

---

but a bunch of stuff other people tell you to get over already? 

---

So you do. You stop remembering. And eventually, everyone forgets. 

---

Even when you write it down, they forget! Or maybe they want to forget. 

---

Or maybe they need to forget, 

---

just to put one foot in front of the other.

---

[Jazz music, voice singing]

AT EVERY STOP THAT WE MADE OH I THOUGHT ABOUT YOU

---

BUT WHEN I PULLED DOWN THE SHADE THEN I REALLY FELT BLUE  

---

[jazz music continues]

## IRMA:

I really didn’t recognize you.I’ve never seen you so thin in my life, Lucien.

---

## LUCIEN:

You got the radio back.

---

## IRMA:

Sure, in August? Whenever they left. 

---

Where’s Pierre? 


---

## LUCIEN:

Taking a bath.

## IRMA:

Still?

---

## LUCIEN:

He’s fifteen mother. He’s got a lot to, figure out.

---

## IRMA:

I guess that’s true. You had enough to eat?

---

## LUCIEN:

What? Yeah. Dinner was good, thanks. 

---

## IRMA:

OK. Only – you used to eat much more. 

---

## LUCIEN:

Well, I used to be fat.

---

## IRMA:

You were never fat. A healthy eater.

---

## LUCIEN:

How diplomatic.

---

## IRMA:

It’s been a long time since I had more than two dishes to wash…

---

## LUCIEN:

Do you have today’s paper?

---

## IRMA:

Maybe. Who knows?

## LUCIEN:

Or a recent one? Anything?

---

## IRMA:

I’m sure we do, somewhere. I’m afraid we’ve become those people.

---

## LUCIEN:

What people?

## IRMA:

People with piles of crap everywhere.

---

## LUCIEN:

Become?

## IRMA:

You saw the postcard? From Jacqueline? 

---

They’re in Mexico now. From Cuba to Mexico.

---

## LUCIEN:

The grand tour…

---

## IRMA:

They met Hemingway. Or saw him, in Havana.

---

## LUCIEN:

Good for them. 


---

## IRMA:

I thought about you every day, Lucien. I prayed for you. 

---

I never prayed in my life, but I prayed for you, 

---

every night. Ask your father.

---

## LUCIEN:

I believe you. 

## IRMA:

Every night I prayed. 

---

## LUCIEN:

Thank you.

---

## IRMA:

We didn’t know where you were…Where were you?

---

## LUCIEN:

Mom: You have to organize this table, it’s… 

---

## IRMA:

This morning, I know – you were in Strasbourg? 

## LUCIEN:

Yes. A beautiful city.

---

## IRMA:

And, but – before Strasbourg, you were… 

## LUCIEN:

I didn’t realize how many canals they have. 

---

## IRMA:

Where were you?

## LUCIEN:

You must have a newspaper.

---

## IRMA:

You can talk to me.

## LUCIEN:

Because this is…

---

## IRMA:

I’m your mother, Lucien, what happened?

## LUCIEN:

How do you find anything on this FUCKING TABLE!

---

## IRMA:

Pierre. 


ADOLPHE:

Irma – the pajamas fit him fine.

---

## IRMA:

I – yes but, what about the shoes?

---

ADOLPHE:

No, those were no good.

YOUNG PIERRE:

They were OK.

---

ADOLPHE:

His feet are bigger than mine, now.

## LUCIEN:

I told you to stop growing.

---

## IRMA:

He needs shoes that fit, he can’t walk around… Add that to the list.

---

ADOLPHE:

Would you like to play something for us?

## IRMA:

He just bathed.

---

ADOLPHE:

So? You remember how to play. You always played so nicely.

---

## IRMA:

Leave him be. You want to sit, darling? You’ve had such a long day.

---

## LUCIEN:

Let’s sit.

---

ADOLPHE:

What did you think of my hometown? I was born in Strasbourg, you know?

---

YOUNG PIERRE:

It looked nice.

---

ADOLPHE:

It is. I’ll take you sometime, I’ll show you where my grandfather opened the first store… 

---

## IRMA:

So. We need to get you shoes. And, clothes, you’ve grown so much. 

---

We have to call the doctor, I want him to look at you, 

---

both of you – and there’s nothing in the house for breakfast, 

---

we have to get some food. Tell me, what would you like?

---

There has to be something, something you missed, maybe? No?

---

## LUCIEN:

Tell Grandma. She wants  to get you something nice.

---

YOUNG PIERRE:

A croissant.

---

## IRMA:

A croissant. Oh. I don’t, uhm…

ADOLPHE:

We haven’t had croissants since, before the war.

---

## IRMA:

Oh.

ADOLPHE:

Rations.

---

## LUCIEN:

That’s alright.

---

## IRMA:

I could get some bread though? In the morning. And butter? Would you like that?

---

I – I wish I could get you a croissant, only…

---

## LUCIEN:

Bread is great. That’ll be great. Right pal? This is great.

---

[music]

## PATRICK:

That is the craziest thing I have ever heard. 


---

## MARCELLE:

I know.

## PATRICK:

That is the craziest thing I have ever heard.

---

## MARCELLE:

You said that.

## PATRICK:

I can’t believe he’s – Have you ever even been to Israel?

---

## MARCELLE:

Once, maybe ten years ago, we took the kids.

## PATRICK:

And?

---

## MARCELLE:

It was OK, it was interesting.

---

## PATRICK:

That is the craziest thing I have ever heard.

## MARCELLE:

OK that’s not helpful anymore.

---

## PATRICK:

So Charles is there now?

## MARCELLE:

Yes.

---

## PATRICK:

With Daniel?

## MARCELLE:

Of course with Daniel. 

---

You think he’d miss a chance to visit the holy land?

---

## PATRICK:

And Elodie?

## MARCELLE:

Elodie had a… 

---

she was supposed to go, who knows with her.

---

## PATRICK:

You’re a psychiatrist, you would know.

## MARCELLE:

You would think.

---

## PATRICK:

I can’t believe they went to – for how long?

---

## MARCELLE:

A few days.

## PATRICK:

But what are they even doing?

---

## MARCELLE:

Checking things out, looking around, I don’t know. Seeing apartments.

---

## PATRICK:

Oh my god.

## MARCELLE:

He wants to leave before the election. 

---

## PATRICK:

Oh come on! She’s never going to win.

---

## MARCELLE:

You think I haven’t been telling him that for months? 

---

But now that America elected –

## PATRICK:

But Americans are idiots.

---

## MARCELLE:

The most powerful nation on Earth…

## PATRICK:

Idiots. 

---

We have our issues but, France will never elect Le Pen, it will never happen, never.

---

## MARCELLE:

Can I get that in writing?

---

## PATRICK:

It will never happen.

---

## MARCELLE:

Charles says once he has an offer, he’ll announce he’s leaving the practice –

---

## PATRICK:

He’s serious?

---

## MARCELLE:

He’s in fucking Israel looking at apartments, I think he’s serious.

---

## PATRICK:

But he spent the last thirty years building that practice.

---

## MARCELLE:

And his partners said they would buy him out.

---

## PATRICK:

But, I mean, you can’t rebuild a practice it took you thirty years to build, 

---

overnight, in a new country

---

## MARCELLE:

You think you’re telling me something I haven’t told him, a hundred times –

---

## PATRICK:

And you’re just going to let him? 

## MARCELLE:

He’s a grown man, I can’t stop him. 

---

## PATRICK:

But what about you?

## MARCELLE:

What about me?

---

## PATRICK:

I mean, you didn’t go with him.

---

## MARCELLE:

Correct, I am here, talking to you, in front of you, so –

---

## PATRICK:

Then, what’s going to happen? 


---

## MARCELLE:

I don’t know, I guess he and Daniel will find a place in Israel, I don’t know.

---

## PATRICK:

So you’re, you’re talking about divorce?

---

## MARCELLE:

Oh. No. It hasn’t gotten there yet. 

---

He still thinks he can convince me to go.

---

## PATRICK:

But you would never. You would never! Would you ever?

---

## MARCELLE:

No.

## PATRICK:

You can’t go. You – what would you do in Israel? 

---

We’re French. We’re – And you’re the most French person I know. 

---

Look at you! You, in a desert?!? You?

---

## MARCELLE:

I don’t even like going to the beach, Patrick, 

---

not even for a visit. Why would I want to live at the beach? 

---

A beach with no ocean? Endless beach, and no ocean? Kill me.

---

## PATRICK:

I mean, they have the sea there, they have –

## MARCELLE:

I know that. It was a – forget it.

---

## PATRICK:

So you’re not going.

---

## MARCELLE:

I don’t know.

## PATRICK:

What does that mean?

---

## MARCELLE:

It means, I Do Not Know, what I am doing. I’m not single.

---

I don’t get to make this decision on my own. I’m part of a family, I’m part of a couple, 

---

there’s a lot to weigh.

## PATRICK:

There’s nothing to weigh. 

---

Your son is going through a phase, he’s – how long has he been doing this whole Jewish thing?

---

## MARCELLE:

This Jewish thing?

## PATRICK:

You know what I – it’s a phase. 

---

You don’t move to a new country for a phase. Look at me!

---

I walk down the street every day, I’m fine. I’m absolutely fine – 

---

## MARCELLE:

It’s not about feeling scared for Daniel, per se, but…

## PATRICK:

But what?

---

## MARCELLE:

Charles feels – and I don’t disagree, necessarily –

## PATRICK:

Necessarily –

---

## MARCELLE:

The fact that, when we expose ourselves, in public, as Jews, 

---

we double triple quadruple the chances of violent attacks – 

---

that that exposes something about how people really feel. 

---

And the only way our people have stayed alive all these years is either –

---

## PATRICK:

Our people –

## MARCELLE:

Is either we –

---

## PATRICK:

You sound like you’re in a cult. Our people –

## MARCELLE:

Is either 

---

we have been lucky, or we got out before it was too late. 

---

And he would know. He watched his family make that 

---

decision when he was a kid. He knows the signs.

---

## PATRICK:

What signs? Are there incidents? Yes, there are incidents.

---

Guess what? It’s not safe anywhere, not anywhere, no matter who you are. 

---

In America they shoot people at the movies, at night clubs, 

---

they don’t care. How many people were killed in Nice last summer? 

---

People of all stripes? 

---

More people died in Nice than all these Jewish attacks combined. 

---

So let’s say you never went to synagogue, 

---

you never did anything quote unquote Jewish, 

---

but one day you go to celebrate Bastille day and all of a sudden –

---

## MARCELLE:

I would never have been there –

## PATRICK:

You don’t know.

---

## MARCELLE:

I would not have been there –

## PATRICK:

You don’t know – 


---

## MARCELLE:

I don’t go to the beach Patrick, I know.I wouldn’t be caught dead, in July, outside, 

---

in a crowd of people, to watch fireworks! That is not something I would do 

---

that is actually one of my recurring nightmares, so no.

---

## PATRICK:

You know what I’m saying. It’s all, it’s indiscriminate.

---

## MARCELLE:

It’s actually not.

---

## PATRICK:

It’s mostly indiscriminate.

---

## MARCELLE:

Mostly mostly mostly. That’s the key word.

---

## PATRICK:

Look, just – use your brain here, OK?

---

## MARCELLE:

I’m trying to use my brain, Patrick. 

---

That is what I am trying to do. 

---

And part of my brain tells me, when I went to visit Israel 

---

I thought it was a perfectly interesting country, and I couldn’t wait to get home. 

---

Part of my brain tells me I am as French as anyone, 

---

and no one and nothing is going to push me out of my own country. 

---

When you feel like you’re under attack, 

---

when your country is quite seriously considering electing 

---

a woman from the National Front, the National Front, 

---

the party that refers to Nazi gas chambers as a quote unquote 

---

“point of detail,” when you find yourself in that situation 

---

you stay and you fight, because you have a right to live in your country 

---

as much as anyone, anyone, and while there may be a few bad people, 

---

that’s not a reason to leave because guess what 

---

there are bad people everywhere. 

---

But. Part of my brain also reminds me, 

---

we grew up without a grandmother, without aunts, 

---

with almost no cousins to speak of and why? 

---

Because they didn’t leave when they could. 

---

So I better be damn sure, when the man I trust the most in this world 

---

tells me he’s scared, that I think long and hard about what he sees that maybe I don’t, 

---

or you don’t, and pay attention.

---

## PATRICK:

And what does Papa think of your big plans?

---

## MARCELLE:

There are no plans, there’s no reason for him to know any of this so just, shah. 


---

## PATRICK:

Cause if you think you can just leave him for me to take care of –

---

## MARCELLE:

Oh, oh, the way you’ve left me to do all the taking care of him for the last, oh, ten years –

---

## PATRICK:

That’s not true!

## MARCELLE:

It’s mostly true.

---

## PATRICK:

I’m the one who’s always saying, it’s time to give up that store

---

## MARCELLE:

Mostly, Mostly, Mostly…. Well that’s not happening.

---

## PATRICK:

He’s fallen down there twice, so… twice.

---

## MARCELLE:

Yeah and who brought him to the hospital? Both times?

---

## PATRICK:

I’m just saying –

## MARCELLE:

And I’m just saying – 

---

don't tell me he’s fallen twice when I’m the one who dealt with it – twice! 

---

That piano store is maybe the only thing left that brings him any joy. 

---

Who are we to take that from him?

---

## PATRICK:

It’s not safe.

---

## MARCELLE:

He’s eighty-six Patrick, if his dream is to lose his balance 

---

and crack his skull on the back of a piano, who are we to stop him?

---

## PATRICK:

I’d really like if we could be on the same page about this.

---

## MARCELLE:

Well we’re not. OK? I’m not on the same page as anyone. 

---

I live on my own page. I live in my own book. 

---

And if one more person asks me to get on the same page 

---

I’m going to put six rocks in my pocket, take myself down to the Seine 

---

and just fucking fling myself into it, OK? 


---

## PATRICK:

So you’re what, you’re just packed? Ready to go at a moment’s notice?

---

## MARCELLE:

What?

---

## PATRICK:

What’s with the suitcase? 

## MARCELLE:

Oh. Oh. Ugh. Molly.

---

## PATRICK:

She’s still here?

## MARCELLE:

Every weekend. 

---

I said she could come one fucking weekend, now I can’t get rid of her.

---

## PATRICK:

It’s your house.

## MARCELLE:

I’m not the one inviting her. 

---

Daniel claims they’re just friends, they just enjoy hanging out.

---

## PATRICK:

Uh huh. Hanging out, every weekend?

## MARCELLE:

Every weekend for two months.

---

## PATRICK:

Good friends, huh?

---

## MARCELLE:

First she was homesick. Then she was, I don’t know. 

---

Then Clinton lost, she was in mourning.

---

## PATRICK:

She should be.

---

## MARCELLE:

I’ve never seen someone cry so hard. 

---

[mock crying]

“I can’t believe my country would do this, I can’t believe my country would do this.” 

---

It’s sweet, actually. You forget when you’re young, 

---

the world can still break your heart.

---

## PATRICK:

So where is this little kissing cousin?

---

## MARCELLE:

I made Elodie take her out.

---

## PATRICK:

Good luck Molly.

---

## MARCELLE:

Good luck indeed. 


---

## PATRICK:

Things are fine, everything’s going to be fine. 

---

You guys, you – you always see the glass half empty. 

---

It’s a sour way to live.

---

## MARCELLE:

Thank you so much for pointing that out, that’s really helpful.

---

## PATRICK:

Who was it? Anne Frank – it was – 

---

Anne Frank who said, after everything, I still believe people are good. 

---

After everything. That’s what Anne Frank said. 

---

Think about that.

---

## MARCELLE:

Yes, she did say that, and a few months later 

---

she was dead, so. Think about that.

---

[funky music]

---

[music continues]

## ELODIE:

No this is my last, last, final point. To be a Jew in Europe, 

---

to be a Jew in France, is to grow up in a place that has historically, 

---

for hundreds and in some cases thousands of years, persecuted you, 

---

in every generation, and when I say persecute I don’t mean 

---

they wouldn’t let you into the nice country club I mean rape. I mean death. 

---

I mean, stealing everything that is yours and then making you 

---

pay taxes on the things they stole. American Jews don’t know 

---

what that feels like, not personally. And don’t get me wrong, 

---

I’m not suggesting there isn’t a raging antisemitism in your country, 

---

of course there is, and who’s to say what gets unleashed 

---

by your new “president,” maybe the whole thing’s about to change, 

---

in which case, you know, welcome to the club 

---

but my point is, when your ancestors left Europe, America was the Holy land, 

---

the promised land, and while the history of antisemitism in America 

---

could fill perhaps a chapter or two of a book, it is not the book. 

---

That’s not to say America is blameless – the opposite is true, obviously. 

---

And of course France is not innocent either – you’re living in Nantes, 

---

you’ve I assume been to the memorial they now have dedicated 

---

to their role in the slave trade, the city’s financial wealth was 

---

all built on the back of that, and no one talked about it – 

---

but name a country that hasn’t tortured segments of its population – 

---

you can’t. 

---

And while the American Jew descends from the refugee 

---

who fled persecution, he himself is not a victim of persecution, 

---

and so he is the first Jew in history who – how do I explain this?

---

So when my grandmother died, my father’s mother – 

---

she was Algerian, then she fled to France she was French – 

---

when she died, I had this weird feeling she felt – 

---

not that she was relieved but that, the rules of history are such that 

---

she was supposed to die at the hands of someone else, 

---

in some hideous and horrible way, but instead, she got to die in her bed, 

---

propped up on a pillow, surrounded by her family, 

---

and while most people assume that’s a normal way to go, 

---

for a Jew, if you get to die in a deathbed, even though you’re dying 

---

you weirdly feel lucky – and obviously I’m surmising, 

---

since I haven’t died myself, but I saw it with my grandmother. 

---

American Jews don’t experience that, they feel pretty free. 

---

So when it comes to Israel, they either despise it, 

---

or they’re slavishly devoted to it because they have a deep-seated understanding in their bones, 

---

that there has never been a country on Earth that hasn’t eventually 

---


at some point turned on its Jews, and even in America, that fate awaits them too. 

---

I mean, look at the Jews of Spain – look at Ladino – you know what Ladino is?

---

Ladino was the language  of Spanish Jews, a mix of Spanish and Hebrew – 

---

like Yiddish, but with Spanish instead of German – 

---

today there are very few speakers left, almost none, but my point is, 

---

it is actually breathtaking to imagine a moment in time when 

---

Jews felt so secure, they invented a whole new language perfectly suited to that country. 

---

I mean, you don’t invent a language, unless you feel really fucking at home somewhere, 

---

and of course we know how that turned out 

---

– expelled, forced conversions, burned at the stake, the works – 

---

American Jews haven’t done that, there’s no combination of Hebrew and, 

---


I don’t even know, Valley Girl? – which suggests they understand that America, 

---

which has been their home and given them refuge may turn on them someday, 

---

perhaps sooner than they realize, I mean, stay tuned, right? 

---

So. Then you have the American Jew who hates Israel 

---

or is highly critical of Israel and I would argue part of why 

---

they feel able to be so critical of Israel is because they feel so safe in America, 

---

because they’ve convinced themselves that they can stay in America forever 

---

and maybe that’s true now but if history is our guide and 

---

history must always be our guide then you have to ask, 

---

so you feel safe today but will that be the case a hundred years from now? Or ten?

---

## MOLLY:

I just think – 

## ELODIE:

Hold on, let me just finish this – 

---

I don’t have an issue with criticism of the state of Israel, 

---

I know some see that as a betrayal, or an act of self-hatred 

---

but I think it’s honorable, or it can be – sometimes it’s performative, 

---

like look at me I’m not one of those disgusting Jews I’m a different  kind of Jew 

---

I’m a genius enlightened Jew who shits on Israel 

---

love me hug me kiss me fuck me, that, I fucking hate – 

---

but the Jew who holds Israel to the highest standards 

---

because they believe we have an obligation to always strive 

---

to be more just and righteous and honorable, that I applaud, 

---

that I think, yes, yes, I want that. 


---

## MOLLY:

I’m sorry, but I’m only following about half of what you’re saying –

---

## ELODIE:

The problem is, we are a tiny minority, 

---

we cannot survive without allies, so then the question becomes, where do we turn? 

---

You can get in bed with the right, but they’re also in bed with the far-right, 

---

and let’s be real, far-right is just a polite way of saying Nazi, 


---

and I don’t know about you, but I don’t get in bed with Nazis, 

---

and I’m not about to accept the occasional bone they’ll throw me 

---

so they can take cover behind me and pretend they’re decent 

---

and then go off and commit whatever atrocities they’re gonna commit 

---

to appease that far-right base which we already established 


---

is just another word for NAZIS. Not happening! 

---

So you think, OK – let’s get as far from the far-right as possible 

---

so you run to the left but that’s a whole other shitshow 

---

because every lefty will tell you their opinion of Benjamin Netanyahu 


---

but I guarantee, you ask what they think of the Prime Minister of India, 

---


half of them couldn’t even tell you that man’s name 

---

and what’s worse is they don’t stop to interrogate why. 

---

Why do they know so much more about Israel than almost anywhere else in the world 

---

because combined, Israel and Palestine combined have about thirteen million people. 

---

Do you know what the population of India is? Do you? 

---

One point three BILLION people. 

---

We’re talking a HUNDRED times more people. 

---

Do you see a HUNDRED times more news stories about India than Israel? 

---

Do you? And they say we control the media? 

---

Indonesia has TWENTY times as many people. Twenty times. 

---

Forget getting twenty times as many articles, when do you hear 

---

ANYTHING about what goes on in Indonesia? 

---


Nigeria, Pakistan, Bangladesh all have more than a HUNDRED MILLION citizens. 

---

You think your average person in France has an opinion on the state of Bangladesh? 

---

But I guarantee you they have an opinion on Israel, maybe if we heard about 

---

what was going on in Indonesia even half as often as we read 

---

about 
Israel our collective priorities would shift a little 

---

but everyone is just obsessed with Israel and you have to ask why? 

---

This is the question. Why? 

---

Why when there’s so many awful things in the world, this becomes your obsession. 

---

Why? You have to interrogate it Molly you have to, this is a must. 

---

Why do so many rallies against Israel devolve into rallies 

---

where people are screaming Death to Israel and then Death to Jews. 

---

Death? This is what they scream, on the streets of Paris, 

---

in my own ears I have heard it ring out, death to Jews, why is that? 

---

Anytime things flare up between Israel and Palestine – 

---

Jews – in other countries – get attacked. 

---

If hating Israel has nothing to do with hating Jews, why does that happen? 

---

Every time? Like clockwork? Or is everyone just ahistorical? 

---

Because – and don’t get me wrong: I don’t think Israel is perfect, but tell me, 

---

what country is?

---

## MOLLY:

Are you familiar with this thing called whataboutism?

---

## ELODIE:

I mean, America gets attacked one time – once – and they’re off to war in the Middle East, 

---

for years –

## MOLLY:

Wait, are – are we on 9/11 now?

---

## ELODIE:

And don’t misunderstand me, I am not minimizing 9/11, 

---

I would never minimize – never –

## MOLLY:

Oh my god, we’re on 9/11 –

---

## ELODIE:

That was an atrocity, I believe that to my core – that said, 

---

America is attacked one time once, and suddenly they’re sending troops 

---

into Iraq for reasons we still don’t understand – gas? oil? – 

---

alongside the British, who then have the gall to condemn other countries? 

---

Are you KIDDING me? I mean, oh my god Molly, 

---

don’t get me started on the British, please don’t get me started on the British.

---

## MOLLY:

I’d actually love it if we could skip the British – 

---

## ELODIE:

What country, on this planet has brought more suffering 

---

and destruction everywhere it has gone –

---

## MOLLY:

But – but most people I know think the war in Iraq was wrong.

---

## ELODIE:

You can think whatever you like, but your tax dollars paid for that war, 

---

you see what I’m saying?

## MOLLY:

Uh, no, I don’t –

---

## ELODIE:

A belief – what is a belief – you think, who cares what you think. 

---

You love the war, you hate the war – either way, 

---

your actions are the same. You paid taxes. Your parents paid taxes. 

---

Your dollars speak louder than any words, and your dollars support the war.

---

## MOLLY:

Well by that logic –

## ELODIE:

Let me finish –

---

## MOLLY:

No by that logic – by your own logic, if dollars speak louder than words, 

---

and my country gives billions of dollars to Israel, 

---

and I don’t like how my money is being spent, 

---

don’t I have a responsibility – an obligation – to speak up? 

---

Sure I could protest human rights violations in Myanmar or Iran or wherever, 

---


but my government’s not sending billions of dollars to those countries, 

---

so my protest might be justified but I’d just be shouting into the wind –

---

## ELODIE:

Then shout about Egypt! They get billions from America, too – 

---

they share a border with Gaza, too – where are the protests about Egypt? 

---

What do you think Egypt is doing with your billions? Putting up solar panels?

---

## MOLLY:

We could go back and forth like this all night, but…

## ELODIE:

And that’s my point! 

---

That’s exactly my point!

## MOLLY:

What is?

---

## ELODIE:

History demands we go back and forth all night, 

---

you can’t understand one thing without understanding everything, 

---

but who takes the time to do that anymore? 

---

And so everyone has become completely ahistorical! 

---

They have no memory, and that is my point, 

---

because what happened to us is documented, it’s all documented, 

---

there’s a reason they call us the people of the book, 

---

if you want to know what happened to the people of the book 

---

then READ THE FUCKING BOOK, 

---

we didn’t go on a cruise for two thousand years you fucking idiots 

---

but that’s my point, that is my fucking point because who reads books anymore 

---

no one reads no one even knows what history is, and that is the real problem, 

---

the real real problem is that most people? Are just stupid. 

---

Most people are so stupid it actually breaks my heart, 

---

so what you end up with are these debates raging online between people 

---

who are stupid to begin with and then basically massively uninformed 

---

but because of the internet, they fancy themselves experts in everything 

---

when the only thing they have expertise in is how to waste a perfectly good life, 

---

but they watch one YouTube video which reduces three thousand years 

---

of complex, dense, complicated history into a two minute summary of events 

---

and they’re suddenly screaming about something they know nothing about 

---

and what’s worse is this doesn’t just pass for debate 

---

in a hundred and forty characters, this becomes policy! 

---

This is how policy gets made and it’s so fucking depressing 

---

it makes me want to blow my brains out. 

---

And this is my point.

## MOLLY:

This is your point?

---

## ELODIE:

This is my point, I just need to make this one point 

---

and this is my point, my point is my brother is kind and he’s good and he’s sweet, and I know that. 

---

And I can see that you see that too, so –

## MOLLY:

Wait, what –

---

## ELODIE:

My brother. He’s a good person. 

---

## MOLLY:

OK. Uhm. Why are you telling me this?

---

## ELODIE:

Because he likes you.

## MOLLY:

What? No, we’re – we’re just friends. 

---

## ELODIE:

You like him, and my brother, he likes you. 

---

## MOLLY:

How do you, I mean, has he told you, he –

---

## ELODIE:

And my brother, when he likes someone, he can become… 

---

susceptible, he can be very easily influenced by them.

---

## MOLLY:

In what way?

---

## ELODIE:

Look what he wears on his head!

---

## MOLLY:

You mean, his kippah?

---

## ELODIE:

You think he woke up one morning and found God?

---

## MOLLY:

He said it was, it was snowing in Paris one night and –

---

## ELODIE:

Oh my god that fucking story – the snow – no – 

---

he met a girl, he met a girl who was religious, 

---

he started to go round with her, and then…

---

## MOLLY:

Then what?

## ELODIE:

She dropped him but this is my point. 

---

Two years later, and he’s still, kippah à la rosh, so, all I’m saying is, 

---

I know you think you know my brother, you’ve spent time with him, 

---

you’ve seen him playing guitar without his shirt which, I get it, 

---

Mohammed has told me enough times how cute he is, 

---

my friends are all obsessed – you’re here for a few months, 

---

then you fly back to America and get to live your life however you want, 

---

supporting Israel, protesting Israel, either way it costs you nothing. 

---

For you, it’s a purely intellectual exercise. 

---

For us, we don’t get the luxury of having an opinion about Israel, 

---

or that piece of shit Netanyahu – because we might need Israel. 

---

And soon. And when 
you need something, when you’re out of options, 

---

you forfeit your right to an opinion. So please: 

---

Don’t make this harder for my family than it already is.

---

## MOLLY:

You just spent the last hour railing against people who are uninformed. 

---

Now you’re asking me to stay silent so your brother can remain uninformed 

---

about perspectives he’s not getting from anywhere else.

---

## ELODIE:

No I just think –

## MOLLY:

No no no I just think, 

---

if you’re a person who values an informed debate, you can’t be scared of information.

---

## ELODIE:

I’m not.

## MOLLY:

Good. Then you have nothing to fear from me. 

---

I’m no expert, I never said I was. But I do read, and I am learning, 

---

and I am trying to be a little less like those idiots you find so – 

---

what’d you call them? Ahistorical. But, like you said, 

---

information doesn’t scare you, so. 

---

I couldn’t possibly be a threat to you, or your family.

---

## ELODIE:

I never said threat.

## MOLLY:

You didn’t have to. 

---

The reality is, your brother and I don’t talk about Israel.

---

But. If we do, you can be sure I will not hesitate 

---

to let him know exactly what I think.

---

---

## ELODIE:

You have a very strong point of view. I like this.

---

## MOLLY:

I don’t know that my point of view is so strong. 

---

I – the America I left, four months ago , feels like a different universe. 

---

It was always flawed, we knew that, but we had – 

---

even if we didn’t always live up to our 
ideals, 

---

at least we had ideals to fall short of – and to strive towards, 

---

but it’s like everyone just… forgot. 

---

And everything’s about to change. 

---

And everyone I know is… petrified. 

---

So when you say it’s all theoretical for me? 

---

You have no idea how scared I am.

---

## ELODIE:

Of course you’re scared. The world is on fire.

---

[Funky music stops and changes to classical]

---

## LUCIEN:

I’m not – no – I’m not doing anything until I check on the store –

---

## IRMA:

The store is fine. That boy needs to see a doctor first.

---

ADOLPHE:

I told him, the inventory was sold, but – 

## LUCIEN:

First we are going to check on the store. 

---

## IRMA:

The store is fine.

ADOLPHE:

The inventory was sold, but the store is fine.

---

## LUCIEN:

But there were, what – three fifty? Four hundred? I couldn’t give those pianos away.

---

ADOLPHE:

Then things came back around. They always do. It’s all circles.

---

## IRMA:

I am worried about him, Lucien, I am.

## LUCIEN:

But – who bought them? 


---

ADOLPHE:

You’d have to ask Irene.

---

## LUCIEN:

Who buys four hundred pianos in the middle of a war?

---

## IRMA:

A doctor needs to see Pierre – a good one. Who knows what he has –

---

ADOLPHE:

Circles.

## IRMA:

Or what happened where you were, or – Who knows!

---

ADOLPHE:

It’s all circles.

## LUCIEN:

Thank you yes, it’s so helpful when you repeat yourself, 

---

please tell me more about circles.

---

## IRMA:

You upset your father.

---

ADOLPHE:

I’m not upset. 

## IRMA:

Of course you are. 

---

## LUCIEN:

I’m sorry, it’s just…

---

ADOLPHE:

It’ll come back around.

---

## LUCIEN:

I know, I just, I thought I’d have something to sell…  

---

[music plays then stops]

---

---

## MARCELLE:

I’m working.

---

## CHARLES:

I see that.

---

## MARCELLE:

Where’s Daniel?

---

## CHARLES:

He went to meet friends. 

---

## MARCELLE:

Friends? 

---

## CHARLES:

You didn’t respond to my texts. 

---

## MARCELLE:

I’m working.

## CHARLES:

All weekend, you didn’t respond.

---

## MARCELLE:

I was working all weekend.

---

## CHARLES:

I would never do anything you didn’t want, too.

---

## MARCELLE:

You’re a grown man do whatever you like.

---

## CHARLES:

I’d like to be with you. Wherever you are, that’s for me.

---

## MARCELLE:

I thought you were scared.

---

## CHARLES:

I am.

---

## MARCELLE:

So?

---

## CHARLES:

So, I’ll be scared here.

---

## MARCELLE:

But if you’re scared, I mean, you think something could happen?

---

## CHARLES:

Yes.

## MARCELLE:

Like what?

---

## CHARLES:

I don’t know. What’s the worst that happens? I die? So I die.

---

## MARCELLE:

What if someone hurts Daniel?

---

## CHARLES:

Then he would die.

## MARCELLE:

Don’t say that! 


---

## CHARLES:

What should I say? 

## MARCELLE:

I couldn’t go on. 

---

## CHARLES:

You’d go on.

## MARCELLE:

I couldn’t.

---

## CHARLES:

You’d go on, Marcelle. 

---

You come from a long line of people who had to bury their children and found a way to go on. 

---

Probably more Jewish parents have had to bury a child than not. 

---

That’s how it is.

---

## MARCELLE:

I don’t want to bury a child.

---

## CHARLES:

And hopefully we never will.

---

## MARCELLE:

Did you like it?

---

## CHARLES:

Yes.

---

## MARCELLE:

Did you see apartments?

---

## CHARLES:

Yes.

---

## MARCELLE:

Were they nice?

---

## CHARLES:

You wouldn’t think so, but –

## MARCELLE:

Why wouldn’t I think so?

---

## CHARLES:

Marcelle. Do I know you at all? 

---

You would have haaaaaaated these apartments. 

---

## MARCELLE:

So they weren’t nice? 

---

## CHARLES:

No. They were very nice. 

## MARCELLE:

Then why would I hate them? 

---

## CHARLES:

Because I know you!

## MARCELLE:

I don’t hate very nice things.

---

## CHARLES:

OK. 

---

## MARCELLE:

A lot of people come back. They go, they can’t make it work,

---

or they can’t find work, they can’t adjust. Two, three years later, they come back to France.

---

## CHARLES:

Did you get my ingredients, to make my –

---

## MARCELLE:

Did you hear me? I said a lot of people come back –

## CHARLES:

I heard you.

---

## MARCELLE:

And?

## CHARLES:

You don’t have to convince me anymore. 

---

You’re here, I want to be with you, that’s it. I accept our fate, whatever it is.

---

## MARCELLE:

That’s dark.

---

## CHARLES:

What do you want me to say? I’m staying with you. OK?

---

## MARCELLE:

And – Daniel?

---

## CHARLES:

He was happy, Marcelle, he was… 

---

He walked down the street, no one stared, no one bothered him. 

---

It was… good. 

---

He wants to finish the school year first – fine. 

---

He promised to wear his cap when he goes out – great. 

---

So. Let me make my donuts for Channukah. Did you get my ingredients?

---

## LUCIEN:

I just thought – I thought I’d have something to sell.

---

ADOLPHE:

What can I tell you? Irene managed to unload the pianos.

---

## LUCIEN:

No, good, but – how?

---

ADOLPHE:

Soldiers.

---

## LUCIEN:

Soldiers? 

---

ADOLPHE:

On their way out, they bought them cheap, shipped them home to Germany.

---

## LUCIEN:

German soldiers bought our pianos?

---

ADOLPHE:

Souvenirs from Paris. Somewhere, a Nazi’s daughter is playing Bach on a Salomon.

---

## LUCIEN:

Well. Enjoy.

---

ADOLPHE:

A couple months, you’ll see, factories will be up and running, you’ll have new pianos to sell.

---

## LUCIEN:

A couple months?

ADOLPHE:

A couple months. Five, six months. 

---

## LUCIEN:

Dad, a couple is two. Two is a couple. 

---

ADOLPHE:

So a few months. Six months.

---

## LUCIEN:

Think pal: June July August September October – November. 

---

You know what that means? New pianos to sell a month before…

---

## PIERRE:

Christmas.

ADOLPHE:

Ehhhhy.

---

## LUCIEN:

Cause there’s gonna be a lot of demand, a lot. 

---

Cause people need music. Especially after… they need pianos. Right? 

---

Who the fuck buys a piano right after a war? 

---

## PATRICK:

Picture them, that first morning back, getting ready to check on the store. 

---

What did they talk about? Did Irma stare at her son, burning a hole through him, desperate to know…

---

## IRMA:

Tell me.

---

## PATRICK:

Did he ignore her? Or say:

## LUCIEN:

Not now. Not ever.

---

## IRMA:

Not ever?

---

## PATRICK:

Or deflect, turn to Pierre and say:

## LUCIEN:

Your shoelace is untied.

---

YOUNG PIERRE:

I know…

## LUCIEN:

Just…

---

## IRMA:

Not ever?

ADOLPHE:

Irma – stop.

---

## IRMA:

I’m not talking to you, I’m talking to Lucien.

---

ADOLPHE:

Well talk to me, OK? 

## IRMA:

I’m sick of talking to you. 

---

ADOLPHE:

That’s the spirit.

YOUNG PIERRE:

When did you get back?

---

## IRMA:

Get back?

YOUNG PIERRE:

To Paris?

---

ADOLPHE:

We stayed.

## IRMA:

We didn’t leave.

---

YOUNG PIERRE:

But what happened when they arrested you?

ADOLPHE:

They didn’t.

---

## IRMA:

We were lucky. 

---

YOUNG PIERRE:

Oh.

---

## PATRICK:

And when they got to the store, 

---

what did they think as they rounded the corner, and looked up?

---

Painted across the side of the building, right there in the street, for anyone to see:

---

Pianos… Salomon. 

---

Like some cave drawing, from a way of life long gone.

---

My grandfather Lucien lived until I was seven. 

---

When I think of him, he’s at the store, surrounded by pianos to sell. 

---

But how he managed that? They’ll put up a plaque for victims. 

---

But the people who find a way forward, with children to feed 

---

and nothing to their name but their name itself? 

---

There’s no plaque for that.

---

[music for a moment]

---

## DANIEL:

Don’t listen to my sister. Elodie doesn’t even believe half the stuff she says. 

---

She just likes to argue.

## MOLLY:

I could tell.

---

## DANIEL:

Because, I’m my own person. I’m not, what’d she call me?

---

## MOLLY:

I don’t want to –

## DANIEL:

No, just, what’d she call me?

---

## MOLLY:

Susceptible. 

---

## DANIEL:

Yeah. That’s not true. I’m, like, the least susceptible person I know, so. 

---

You can share any views you want.

## MOLLY:

Uhm, I’m good, thanks.

---

## DANIEL:

But I like hearing different points of view. 

---

## MOLLY:

Well lucky for you, someone invented the internet! 

---

## DANIEL:

I should never have let my sister near you.

---

## MOLLY:

I actually kind of liked talking to her.

## DANIEL:

Please.

---

## MOLLY:

I did. It was informative.

## DANIEL:

About…

---

## MOLLY:

You. Mostly.

## DANIEL:

Oh god. What’d she tell you? Oh god.

---

## ELODIE:

You play guitar?

---

## DANIEL:

Not, like, super well, but…

## MOLLY:

Without your shirt on? 

---

## DANIEL:

Oh. Oh, that’s – humiliating. 

## MOLLY:

I’ve never seen you do that.

---

## DANIEL:

That’s… only if I’m around the house or, if no one’s around or whatever.

---

## MOLLY:

What do you play?

## DANIEL:

I don’t know. 

---

My Dad’s uhm, obsessed with American music. We were basically raised on Bob Dylan.

---

## MOLLY:

I like Bob Dylan.

---

## DANIEL:

You want me to take my shirt off and play some Bob Dylan?

---

Everyone’s asleep. 

## MOLLY:

You could whisper.

---

[Bob Dylan song plays]

---

[Music continues over scene]
## DANIEL:

Oh. You’re still up.

---

## CHARLES:

I’m still up. You two want to help, I’ll finish sooner, the sooner I finish, the sooner I go to bed…

---

## MOLLY:

Definitely.

---

## CHARLES:

Great. All I’m doing is rolling them out, flour your hands, and grab some dough – not too much.

---

## MOLLY:

OK.

## CHARLES:

It’s not hard, they’ll puff up overnight. 

---

Then tomorrow we fry them in oil, of course – oil everything, 

---

the miracle of Channukah – you don’t have to overwork it – 

---

squirt a little jelly inside, some powdered sugar, and we’re set.

---

You’re a natural.

---

## MOLLY:

It’s relaxing, actually.

## CHARLES:

It is, isn’t it?

---

## MOLLY:

This is a family recipe?

---

## DANIEL:

Yeah, it was my grandma’s, and probably her grandma’s before her. 

---

## MOLLY:

Oh wow, really?

## CHARLES:

No.

---

## DANIEL:

Yes it is.

---

## CHARLES:

The recipe comes from an ex-girlfriend. Before Marcelle.

## DANIEL:

Wait, what?

---

## CHARLES:

My family thinks it’s straight out of grandma’s kitchen, but… no.

---

## DANIEL:

Does Mom know?

## CHARLES:

No and there’s no reason she needs to, so. Shhh…

---

## DANIEL:

Oh my god! You just destroyed my childhood!

---

## CHARLES:

You’ll be OK.

## DANIEL:

Oh my god!

---

## CHARLES:

Come, roll. Let’s make grandma’s donuts.

---

## DANIEL:

Not funny.

## MOLLY:

Your mother was from Algeria?

---

## CHARLES:

And me. My whole family, everyone. Going back five hundred years.

---

## MOLLY:

Wow.

## CHARLES:

And Spain before that. 

---

Probably fourteen hundred years in Spain, before the Inquisition.

---

## MOLLY:

What was it like, in Algeria? 

## CHARLES:

I was just a kid when we left. 

---

## MOLLY:

Yeah.

## CHARLES:

But I remember the kitchen. 

---

The smell… that’s the most powerful sense. 

---

It was an Arabic kitchen, you know, couscous and spices. 

---

We felt Arab – we were. In Algeria, we all lived together, everyone got along, 

---

it was, you know, all the kids growing up together, 

---

you’d maybe, you’d go have a snack at this one’s house, 

---

they’d come have a snack at your house. It was a nice way to grow up. But…

---

## MOLLY:

You felt, you had to leave?

## CHARLES:

Oh, there was no choice, absolutely no choice. 

---

And then we came here but, no one knew what to make of us, the French Jews didn’t. 

---

I had much more in common with Muslims in Algeria. 

---

The Jews in France, they were still in shock from World War II, 

---

trying to fade into the background. Then we showed up, 

---

talking loud, laughing loud. We hadn’t gone through what they had. 

---

I’ve heard them say it was like we came and started dancing in the streets. 

---

No shame, no fear. We felt free. And we were, for a time. It was beautiful.

---

## MOLLY:

I imagine, if you have to leave your home, that’s something you only want to do once.

---

[Music Stops]

I can’t imagine, doing that twice, in one lifetime…

---

## CHARLES:

Well. Imagine.

---

## DANIEL:

If Grandma were alive, she’d be chaining herself to the Bastille. 

---

Iron chains. You’d have to drag her from here, kicking and screaming. She loved France.

---

## CHARLES:

And she had loved Algeria. But she left. Then she came here, she loved it here. 

---

You can learn to love it anywhere.

## DANIEL:

You think so?

---

## CHARLES:

I know so.

---

This is what the Benhamous do. 

---

We just keep criss- crossing the Mediterranean, just back and forth and back and forth until forever. 

---

Spain, Algeria, France…Always on the go, always moving, never…Always wandering…But what can you do? 

---

It’s the suitcase, or the coffin.

---

[Classical Music plays for a moment]

## IRMA:

Lucien.

---

## LUCIEN:

I’m trying to count.

---

## IRMA:

We’re really going to sit around playing cards, like nothing happened?

---

## LUCIEN:

Yep. Now do you want to start, or shall I? 

---

## IRMA:

What I want, is to talk about what happened. 

ADOLPHE:

Irma.

---

## IRMA:

Almost two years without a word from you, I want to know.

---

ADOLPHE:

Stop.

## LUCIEN:

I’m here now, that’s enough. 

---

## IRMA:

You’re my son. I need to know. 

ADOLPHE:

Stop!

---

## LUCIEN:

Trust me: You don’t want to know.

## IRMA:

Trust me: I do.

---

ADOLPHE:

For godssake, Irma, stop. 

## IRMA:

Stop telling me to stop! 

---

You’ve been telling me to stop all day, you stop! 

---

You of all people. You were with me, here in this apartment, 

---

meal after meal, at this table, this table, for two years, 

---

while I was losing my mind, never knowing where the children were, 

---

how they were, what was happening – not knowing anything! 

---

Not knowing, my mind running away with the most frightning, 

---

the most – so much worse, letting your mind imagine – 

---

so much worse than knowing the truth not knowing not knowing never knowing –

---

## LUCIEN:

What do you want to know, Mom? What? 

---

We went to Poland! They split us up! What do you want to know?

---

## IRMA:

I want to know!

## LUCIEN:

You want to know how 

---

I watched them rip Colette’s little purse out of her hands and throw it onto a pile of other people’s shit? 

---

How I helped my father- in-law into a truck and never saw him again? 

---

What exactly do you want to know, huh? What? What? 

---

WHAT?

## IRMA:

I want to know what happened to the girls!

---

## LUCIEN:

They’re dead! OK! They’re dead! They’re fucking dead! 

---

I love you! OK? I love you. I –

[Sobbing]

ACT THREE

[Music plays]

---

## CHARLES:

This is the bread of affliction, the poor bread,

---

which our ancestors ate in the land of Egypt. 

---

Let all who are hungry come and eat. 

---

Let all who are in want share the hope of Passover.

---

As we celebrate here, we join with our people everywhere. 

---

This year we celebrate here. Next year in… the land of Israel. 

---

Now we are still in bonds. Next year may all be free.

---

## PATRICK:

After a mild winter, in the early days of spring, 2017, 

---

the Benhamous gathered for Passover. 

---

Marcelle and I were not raised with this holiday. 

---

But I would sometimes come, and silently marvel at how my sister 

---

had mastered this ancient ritual, which had surely been celebrated 

---

for generations in our family – until it wasn’t, 

---

until Marcelle rescued it from the lost and found.

---

I watched my nephew and niece lead us through the ceremony, 

---

as my own daughters never could. 


---

## DANIEL:

Karpas. Greens for spring, dipped in salt water, 

---

a symbol of the tears shed by our ancestors.

---

## ELODIE:

Maror. Bitter herbs. The harshness of slavery, 

---

reduced to a single bite of horseradish.

---

## PATRICK:

And at this seder, I was not the only guest.

---

## CHARLES:

And this is Molly.

## PATRICK:

Ohhhh.

---

## MOLLY:

In every generation, each of us should feel as though we ourselves had gone forth from Egypt.

---

## ELODIE:

Bitter herbs?

---

## DANIEL:

In every generation, in every age, some rise up to plot our annihilation. 

---

But a divine power sustains and delivers us.

---

## PATRICK:

After the Seder, we had our meal, 

---

which was one-quarter eating, three-quarters arguing.

---

## ELODIE:

This is my last, last, final point.

## PATRICK:

No! 

---

No more points Elodie. She’ll never win, so…

---

## ELODIE:

But that’s not the point! 

---

She’s going to make the top two, and that’s what’s so upsetting, 

---

and that’s my point –

## PATRICK:

But France will never elect Le Pen.

---

## ELODIE:

Oh my god, Uncle Patrick, you’re smarter than that. 

---

Is it actually inconceivable to you that a democratic nation could elect a monster? 

---

Please.

---

## CHARLES:

We have an election in two weeks, for President.

---

## MOLLY:

Yes, I’ve been following. And you – you do it in two parts?

---

## CHARLES:

Yes, round one has lots of candidates to choose from, then the top two face off two weeks later. 


---

## DANIEL:

For a while it looked like Fillon’s to lose, but…

---

## ELODIE:

That was before the nepotism scandal, 

---

so it’ll probably be Macron who’s neither right nor left, but –

---

## PATRICK:

But he will defeat her in the end.

## CHARLES:

You actually don’t know that.

---

## DANIEL:

Le Pen’s party is the National Front, they’re kind of like…

---

## ELODIE:

Nazis. They’re Nazis.

---

## DANIEL:

They’re not Nazis, but, historically, they’ve been sympathizers.

---

## ELODIE:

With Nazis.

## DANIEL:

And they’re xenophobic, and Islamaphobic.

## ELODIE:

It’s a charming party, she leads.

---

## PATRICK:

I kept waiting for my sister to jump in, 

---

she usually dominated family conversation, but she was quiet that night. 

---

Unusually so.

---

## MARCELLE:

All done?

## PATRICK:

When do you return to America?

---

## MOLLY:

At the end of the month.

---

## PATRICK:

And have you enjoyed yourself in France?

---

## MOLLY:

Enjoy doesn’t – putting all else aside – 

---

just the croissants – the croissants alone – on your block – on your block.

---

## CHARLES:

They’re not bad, right?

---

## PATRICK:

And you’ve done all the things, seen all the sites?

## MOLLY:

Just about. 

---

Except, you know, the best free concert in Paris, apparently. 

---

## PATRICK:

What concert is that?

---

## MOLLY:

I was told someone at this table gives the best Bob Dylan serenade –

---

## DANIEL:

Thanks a lot.

---

## ELODIE:

It was in the context of a much larger discussion about the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.

---

## PATRICK:

Huh?

## ELODIE:

I can go into it, if you want –

---

## DANIEL:

Don’t!	

## PATRICK:

No!

---

## CHARLES:

Daniel does have a beautiful voice. We find him out here, playing guitar, no shirt – pants, but no shirt –

---

## DANIEL:

Oh my god!

## ELODIE:

He’s very into the shirtless kippah look.

---

## DANIEL:

And, we’re done. 

## MOLLY:

Well I’d love to see it sometime.

---

## ELODIE:

Awww. Cousins.

---

## PATRICK:

As Marcelle continued clearing, 

---

the kids were sent to look for the afikomen, though Elodie refused.

---

## ELODIE:

The whole notion of the afikomen is antisemitic.

---

## CHARLES:

It’s part of our tradition. Our own tradition can’t be antisemitic!

---

## ELODIE:

Fine, let me rephrase: 

---

this section perpetuates a lot of antisemitic tropes I don’t think are helpful.

---

## CHARLES:

But you haven’t even looked for it. You haven’t even –

---

## DANIEL:

Too late. 

## CHARLES:

Already?

---

## DANIEL:

You stick it in the same place every year.

---

## CHARLES:

Yes but this is reverse psychology – Marcelle – isn’t this reverse psychology?

---

## MARCELLE:

No.

---

## ELODIE:

I move that we stop doing it. 

## CHARLES:

You want to rewrite the seder? 

---

## ELODIE:

It’s offensive.

## CHARLES:

Offensive?!?

---

## PATRICK:

Personally, I see Elodie’s point. Jews? Haggling over money? Not a good look.

---

## ELODIE:

Thank you!

## CHARLES:

Who asked you? 

---

You don’t even celebrate Passover.

## PATRICK:

I’m here, aren’t I?

---

## CHARLES:

You haven’t been to a seder in what, five years? 

---

## ELODIE:

Which is why he’s the perfect person to weigh in – 

---

## DANIEL:

Can we finish?

## CHARLES:

But –

---

## DANIEL:

Let’s finish. Or we’ll be here all night.

---

## PATRICK:

At this point, despite Elodie’s protests, 

---

Daniel and Charles make a show of negotiating for the matzah, 

---

they break it into pieces, we all partake, then Charles reads:

---

## CHARLES:

The injustice of this world still brings to mind Elijah, 

---

who in defense of justice, challenged power. 

---

Elijah opens up the realm of mystery and wonder. 

---

Let us now open the door for Elijah! 


---

## MARCELLE:

NOOOO!!!!!! Skip this part.

---

## DANIEL:

You can’t skip this part this is –

---

## MARCELLE:

Skip this part, just skip it. 

---

We’re not doing it this year. What’s next?

## DANIEL:

But I –

---

## MARCELLE:

What comes next? 

## DANIEL:

But I have to open the door – 

---

## MARCELLE:

Sit! Down!

## CHARLES:

Sit down, son.

---

## ELODIE:

But you know he came through her window, he didn’t come through the door –

---

## MARCELLE:

I don’t care.

---

## PATRICK:

She’s referencing Halimi. Sarah Halimi. 

---

You heard what happened?

---

## MARCELLE:

Doctor Sarah Halimi, she had a doctorate, she was a doctor.

---

## MOLLY:

I don’t think so.

---

## PATRICK:

She died last week.

## MARCELLE:

She didn’t die. She was killed. In her apartment. 

---

In her apartment. And no one is calling it an act of antisemitism.

---

## CHARLES:

A man broke into her apartment. 

---

The neighbors heard him scream Allahu Akbar, then he apparently said “I killed the demon.” 


---

## ELODIE:

He went to a different apartment first, he didn’t start in her apartment –

---

## MARCELLE:

She was the only Jew in her building and she was the only one killed. 

---

That’s a coincidence? God it’s amazing how many coincidences there are in this world.

---

## ELODIE:

I didn’t say it was a coincidence, I just said he went to a different apartment first, 

---

maybe when he realized she was Jewish it added fuel to the fire 

---

but he didn’t start out looking for someone Jewish. He was insane.

---

## MARCELLE:

We are gunned down in our schools, in our supermarkets, 

---

now we are thrown out the windows of our own homes.

---

## PATRICK:

She was thrown out the window.

## MOLLY:

Yeah I – I got that.

---

## CHARLES:

They don’t think she’s related to Ilan Halimi.

---

## MARCELLE:

The fact that they share the same last name isa coincidence.

---

## DANIEL:

Ilan Halimi’s the man who was kidnapped and murdered maybe ten years ago?

---

## MARCELLE:

Man? He was twenty-three. Younger than both of you.

---

## DANIEL:

They tortured him for three weeks, then dumped his body on the side of the road.

---

## MARCELLE:

One percent of the population, we are; and forty percent of the hate crimes. 

---

Forty percent! Can you explain that? Can you even fathom it? 

---

And Marine Le Pen is going to win enough votes in two weeks 

---

to be in the run off for President of France. 

---

Marine Le fucking Pen!

---

## PATRICK:

Marine Le Pen is never going to win in the end though, you know that. 

---

## MARCELLE:

I don’t know anything except I begged Daniel not to go out with any visible signs, 

---

and now we come to learn you are not safe at home, with the door locked tight. 

---

Your own home.

## CHARLES:

It’s OK, dear. 

---

It’s OK. She’s exhausted. She hasn’t slept in a week.

---

## PATRICK:

Why aren’t you sleeping?

---

## MARCELLE:

I can’t. I can’t. I try, I hear a sound. I get up to look, 

---

standing in the dark with my flashlight, like a burglar in my own home – 

---

there’s nothing there, I go back to bed, I hear something else – I can’t sleep.

---

## PATRICK:

So, take an Ambien. 

## MARCELLE:

Don’t make a joke of this. 

---

## PATRICK:

I’m not.

## CHARLES:

This isn’t a joke.

---

## MARCELLE:

I have been… I am the holdout. 

---

I am holding everyone back but maybe it’s time to listen to… 

---

what you all have been trying to tell me. 

---

Maybe it’s time, if you all, if you all want to leave, 

---

maybe it’s time for me to listen…

---

## PATRICK:

Is that a joke?

---

## CHARLES:

Does she look like she’s joking?

---

## PATRICK:

Uh… People die every day, Marcelle, let’s not lose our minds. A

---

woman got killed. Is it sad? Yes, it’s sad. But –

---

## MARCELLE:

A Jewish woman was killed, in her home, in Paris, last week. That could have been me.

---

## PATRICK:

But it’s not! I – I don’t even – I – are you serious?

---

Come on, this is bullshit.

---

## CHARLES:

It’s not bullshit, it happened! 

---

## PATRICK:

This whole thing is bullshit it’s bullshit Marcelle! It’s bullshit!

---

## CHARLES:

What exactly is bullshit? 

---

## PATRICK:

I am talking to my sister, not you. 

## CHARLES:

Excuse me?

---

## MARCELLE:

Anything you have to say to me you can say to him.

---

## PATRICK:

I’ll say it in front of him but I don’t want to be interrupted by him because I don’t –

---

## CHARLES:

Oh you don’t want to be interrupted –

---

## PATRICK:

Because I don’t want to hear what he has to say. 

---

I don’t care what you have to say because you are – he – he – 

---

this man – this man has – he brainwashed you.

---

## CHARLES:

Excuse me??

## MARCELLE:

What are you talking about –

---

## PATRICK:

He brainwashed you he did he brainwashed you.

---

## CHARLES:

Brainwashed! Wow!

## PATRICK:

We didn’t grow up with this bullshit Marcelle 

---

I’m sorry but that’s what it is it’s bullshit. 

---

Your seder was nice, your children’s bar mitzvahs – very sweet, but it’s bullshit. 

---

You’re smart enough to see that.

---

## CHARLES:

What part exactly would you call bullshit –

---

## PATRICK:

I am not talking to you I am talking to my sister don’t interrupt me.

---

Before you met him, before you met this man, we – 

---

we didn’t even grow up Jewish. 

---

We’re not even – technically we’re only half – and technically the wrong half!

---

## MARCELLE:

Not only did I consider myself Jewish before I met Charles, 

---

I also converted when we married, as you well know, so I am not technically anything – 

---

## PATRICK:

We are barely Jews, Marcelle.

## MARCELLE:

No, you are barely a Jew. 

---

And with all due respect you raised your daughters to be a quarter of nothing.

---

## PATRICK:

That’s right! I raised my girls to decide for themselves what to believe. 

---

I didn’t impose my bullshit on them.

---

## CHARLES:

And somehow they turned out militantly secular! 

---

How did that happen?

## MARCELLE:

Another coincidence!

---

## PATRICK:

Do you hear him, Marcelle, do you hear him?

---

## CHARLES:

Do you have a problem with me Patrick?

---

## PATRICK:

You have brainwashed my sister and you have put my sister in danger.

---

## CHARLES:

Danger!

## PATRICK:

Yes. We were fine, before she met you, we were fine.

---

## CHARLES:

Yeah, your family was really thriving in France. 

---

Before I turned up on the scene, everything was hunky dory.

---

## PATRICK:

You’re scared in France, so you want to go, where? The Middle East? 

---

The most contentious strip of land, in the most volatile region in the world – 

---

people are pouring out of the Middle East – that’s where safety lies?

---

## MARCELLE:

So where should we go? Where is safe for us? 

---

## PATRICK:

And you know where Israelis are going? Berlin! 

## MARCELLE:

Oh perfect!

---

## PATRICK:

They’re going back to Germany! In droves! They’re writing articles about it – 

---

## ELODIE:

Not in droves, in very small numbers.

---

## PATRICK:

They’re going back to Germany, so – What does that tell you?

---

## MARCELLE:

It tells me good for them but they are not my family 

---

my concern is for my family so again I ask you, Patrick: 

---

Where is safe for us?

## PATRICK:

Berlin! Here! Wherever!

---

## MARCELLE:

No not wherever. That is the point. Where is safe? Tell me! 

---

Where can we go to feel safe?

---

## CHARLES:

Let’s run through the list. Start with A. A. Afghanistan?

---

## MARCELLE:

I’ll pass.

## CHARLES:

Argentina? 

---

It’s not even twenty-five years since they blew up that JCC in Buenos Aires. 

---

Eighty- five Jews, blown to smithereens. So, Argentina’s out. 

---

Algeria?

---

## MARCELLE:

Where should we go Patrick? Name it for me. 

---

Where are Jews safe? Where is my family supposed to go?

---

## DANIEL:

I don’t want to go anywhere.

---

## MARCELLE:

Come again?

---

## DANIEL:

I don’t.

---

## MARCELLE:

What are you talking about? You are the reason – 

---

you’re the reason we are doing this –

---

## DANIEL:

Don’t put this on me.

---

## MARCELLE:

Dad took you to Israel, Dad took you to –

---

## DANIEL:

No, I accompanied Dad to Israel – 

---

## MARCELLE:

Oh my god such semantics!

---

## CHARLES:

I took you to Israel because you don’t feel safe here.

---

## DANIEL:

No you don’t feel safe here, I’m not that worried.

---

## PATRICK:

Good for you!

## CHARLES:

Stay out of this Patrick.

---

## MARCELLE:

You said you could see yourself living there, you said –

---

## DANIEL:

Well I thought about it, and I don’t want to leave.

---

## PATRICK:

Good for you, Daniel!

## CHARLES:

Shut UP Patrick. 

---

## MARCELLE:

You thought about it? 

## DANIEL:

I thought about it.

---

## CHARLES:

What happened since you came back, that would make you change your mind? 

---

What happened that made you change your mind…

---

## MARCELLE:

Get out.

## DANIEL:

Don’t talk to her that way!

---

## MOLLY:

We never talk about – not since that first night – not once –

---

## MARCELLE:

Get out of my house.

## DANIEL:

This has nothing to do with Molly!

---

## PATRICK:

That’s how you treat the stranger in our midst!

---

## MARCELLE:

Oh fuck off Patrick –

## PATRICK:

She’s our cousin!

---

## MARCELLE:

Our cousin? You didn’t know this cousin existed until five minutes ago 

---

don’t call her our cousin like you give a shit. 

---

## DANIEL:

This has nothing to do with Molly.

## MOLLY:

We don’t discuss it, really.

---

## MARCELLE:

I begged you to talk to him!

---

## ELODIE:

I did talk to him! And her. And I told her to back off –

## MOLLY:

And I did!

---

## DANIEL:

Molly never discussed this with me. I tried – she refused! 

---

She refused! It’s my decision.

## ELODIE:

Bullshit.

---

## CHARLES:

Yes that’s bullshit, that’s called bullshit Patrick! That’s bullshit!

---

## DANIEL:

It’s not bullshit!

---

## ELODIE:

Everyone knows, when you like someone, you’re susceptible!

---

## DANIEL:

I am not!

## ELODIE:

Uhh… yes!

---

## MARCELLE:

Yes! You are!

## CHARLES:

You are.

---

## DANIEL:

Oh my god! Everybody! Stop! This is my choice. It’s my choice. That’s it. OK? That’s it. That’s…

---

## MARCELLE:

You care about that boy? He’s been beaten in the streets. 

---

You saw it yourself. You care about him?

---

## MOLLY:

For the record, we never discussed it. 

---

Never. Just so you know…

---

## CHARLES:

You can look down on us, laugh behind our backs – 

---

call it bullshit, it makes no difference. 

---

Last I checked they don’t ask your personal feelings when 
they come knocking. 

---

Hey! This guy thinks it’s bullshit, spare him – no. 

---

You get shoved off to the same place we’re going.

---

## PATRICK:

NOT IF THEY DON’T KNOW!!!

---

Our father gave us a gift, this is what you did with it? Fuck.

---

## MARCELLE:

A gift?

---

## PATRICK:

You think he just married Mom? You think that just happened? 

---

People just fall in love? People don’t just fall in love, Marcelle, 

---

that’s not how love works. 

---

Papa saw things we can never imagine, and then he married – 

---

a nice, Catholic girl. You think that was an accident? 

---

But you knew better, you always know better.

---

My dear sister, listen to me. There are very few things worth dying for. 

---

An old religion is not one of them. You want to draw the curtains once a week

---

and light candles in the dark? No one’s going to stop you. But be smart. 

---

My family will still be alive in a hundred years. Will yours?

---

## MARCELLE:

Don’t close the door. Leave it open. Let Elijah in. 

---

And anyone else who wants to come, let them all in.

---

[Dramatic Strings]

---

## IRMA:

Respectfully, I disagree. 

---

## LUCIEN:

And I appreciate that, but respectfully – I’m his father.

---

## IRMA:

Yes you are.

## LUCIEN:

I’ll decide what’s best.

---

## IRMA:

Absolutely. 

ADOLPHE:

Very good. 

---

## LUCIEN:

Thank you.

## IRMA:

It’s just –

---

## LUCIEN:

Mom…

ADOLPHE:

Irma…

---

## IRMA:

A boy his age should be in school. That’s all.

---

## LUCIEN:

I was his age, when I started working.

## IRMA:

You were not.

---

## LUCIEN:

Close enough.

---

## IRMA:

You finished high school. I have your diploma, somewhere.

---

## LUCIEN:

Where – In one of your piles?

## IRMA:

I have your diploma.

---

## LUCIEN:

So, clearly that came in handy.

---

## IRMA:

He’s missed two years, he’s so far behind. 

---

## LUCIEN:

I’ll have twice as much work, without Robert. 

## IRMA:

For half as many customers!

---

## LUCIEN:

It’s still more than I can handle on my own.

---

## IRMA:

So you’ll hire someone.

## LUCIEN:

With what money?

---

## IRMA:

What good will he be, if he can’t do basic math? 

---

## LUCIEN:

He can do basic math!

## IRMA:

Or read? Or write?

---

## LUCIEN:

He reads. He writes. He’s fifteen!

## IRMA:

No one’s buying pianos, Lucien. 

---

We’re on rations, no one’s buying pianos, what’s the rush?

---

ADOLPHE:

It’ll come back, it came back in ’18, after ’29… 

---

## LUCIEN:

He’s gonna run the store eventually – 

ADOLPHE:

It’s all circles.

---

## LUCIEN:

Might as well learn now, and I need the help so it’s as good a time as any for him to start and –

---

YOUNG PIERRE:

What if I don’t want to sell pianos?

---

## LUCIEN:

Then you won’t.

---

ADOLPHE:

Of course, you will do whatever you think is best, 

---

and you can do anything, you are more than capable. 

---

But it’s nice to be at the store, just to be there, 

---

because that’s the place, you know. It’s our place. 

---

And it’s a nice way to make a living. Work is always hard it always is, 

---

but some people work their whole lives, it doesn’t mean much to them, 

---

and isn’t much appreciated by anyone else. 

---

Our work brings joy. In homes all across France, children learn to play on pianos from our stores. 

---

That’s what we do. And it put food on our table.

---

How lucky are we?

---

## PATRICK:

A few weeks go by. Macron defeats Le Pen. 

---

Just like I told everyone he would. I hear nothing from my sister. 

---

We aren’t speaking. I know – you’re shocked. I think about calling…

---

Fuck her. She can call me.

---

[phone rings]

---

Fuck her. I don’t want talk to her.

---

YOUNG PIERRE:

Talk to your sister.

---

## PATRICK:

This is an obsession of my father’s – talking to my sister.

---

YOUNG PIERRE:

What else is there, once your parents are gone?

---

## PATRICK:

All my life, whenever Marcelle and I fought, he’d say:

---

YOUNG PIERRE:

She’s your baby sister.

## PATRICK:

So?

---

YOUNG PIERRE:

You know how rare that is, in this family, to still have your sibling?

---

## IRMA:

When my sister died, we were separated by an ocean.

---

## LUCIEN:

My brother was killed in another country.

---

YOUNG PIERRE:

My sisters were killed meters from where I stood.

---

## IRMA:

I learned she died in a letter. I never said goodbye. I didn’t attend her funeral.

---

## LUCIEN:

What funeral?

YOUNG PIERRE:

I was their kid brother.

---

## IRMA:

I have no one left, to talk about my childhood, remember my parents with.

---

## LUCIEN:

No one to work beside. Argue with. Rage against.

---

YOUNG PIERRE:

There’s no one left to protect me now. 

---

## IRMA:

I hope it won’t always be like this, for our family.

---

## LUCIEN:

I hope so, too.

YOUNG PIERRE:

I hope so too.

---

## PATRICK:

Jesus Christ. What a guilt trip. 

---

YOUNG PIERRE:

Just call your sister, sweetheart. 

---

## PATRICK:

When she wants to talk, she’ll call me.

---

YOUNG PIERRE:

She did! You sent it to voicemail!

---

[phone rings]

---

## PATRICK:

OK.  What!

---

## MARCELLE:

We need to talk.

---

## PATRICK:

So talk.She tells me they’re leaving –

---

## MARCELLE:

We’re leaving. 

## PATRICK:

Her, Charles, Elodie. 

---

## MARCELLE:

Daniel’s still deciding.

---

## PATRICK:

I tell her: Great! Have a good time!

---

I say: You don’t need my permission. 

---

I say: Is that it? She says:

---

## MARCELLE:

No. There’s something else.

---

## PATRICK:

I say: What is it? What And she says:

## MARCELLE:

Papa.

---

I am of course going to ask him to come with us but –

---

## PATRICK:

Never! He’s not leaving France! 

---

And don’t you dare try to drag him away because of –

---

## MARCELLE:

I know he won’t leave. I know that. I’m going to offer – 

---

so he knows he’s wanted, he has options… I know he won’t take it.

---

## PATRICK:

You know what it’s called when you make an offer to someone you know they won’t accept?

---

## MARCELLE:

I –

## PATRICK:

Bullshit. 

---

That’s called bullshit, Marcelle.

---

## MARCELLE:

I’ll be back, and – often – it’s not far, if he needs me but, you will be the person now, if something comes up –

---

## PATRICK:

No.

---

## MARCELLE:

Really?

---

## PATRICK:

Really. You want to leave, wash your hands of him? That’s on you.

---

## MARCELLE:

I’m not washing my hands of him!

---

## PATRICK:

I’m not here to alleviate the burden of your guilt. 

---

Don’t worry, do whatever you need honey, I’ve got this. 

---

No, I don’t have this. You want to go, go. Bye. 


---

## MARCELLE:

You think this is easy? 

---

You think this isn’t the most impossible thing I have – this is my home. 

---

My home. This is where – my first words were in French. 

---

My whole world everything I think feel say read dream, every friend, every relative I’ve loved is – 

---

I am not some wandering Jew. I have a home. 

---

You think this is anything but agony?

---

I have gone out of my way to protect Papa because I know, 

---

I saw… since my wedding day I never said a word 

---

I never invited him to a single holiday because I saw – 

---

I will never forget, waiting in the back of the synagogue to get married, 

---

they pass around the basket of kippahs, 

---

the basket gets to Papa and he held it in his hand like it was a moon rock, a piece of Mars. 

---

And when he put it on his balding head, it didn’t lie flat on his skull, 

---

it stood up in this weird way, almost on purpose, 

---

like he wanted everyone to see it didn’t belong on him, 

---

it had nothing to do with him. 

---

He looked so… frightened, 

---

I said, I will never inflict that on him again and I haven’t. 

---

But now, how do I…How do I…

---

How do I tell him, at the end of his life, that his daughter 

---

is asking the same question he heard his parents ask when he was a little boy?

---

How do I tell him?

---

I… I need to know he will have someone when I… 

---

I need to know that. I need to –

---

## PATRICK:

He will have someone. 

---

## MARCELLE:

I need that, Patrick, I need it. 

---

## PATRICK:

He will have someone.

---

## MARCELLE:

And if you would be there when I tell him, so he knows I –

---

## PATRICK:

I will be there. 

---

## MARCELLE:

I just don’t want him to feel like I’m, I’m abandoning him, when he needs me most 

---

because I could never abandon him I couldn’t do that to him, I couldn’t, I just, couldn’t.

---

## PATRICK:

I will be there.

---

[Rain]

---

[Daniel plays 'Forever Young', and Molly laughs happily]

---

## MOLLY:

I should just kill myself right now.

---

## DANIEL:

What?!?

---

## MOLLY:

What is going to top this moment in my life?

## DANIEL:

Oh.

---

## MOLLY:

You don’t even know – you can’t begin to understand –

## DANIEL:

Understand what?

---

## MOLLY:

It’s not – you’re French, you won’t get it but when I tell people

---

I was serenaded by my boyfriend in Paris, do you even know? 

---

Not that we used that word but for all intents and purposes 

---

I had a French boyfriend, in France, in Paris. Do you know how sexy that is where I come from?

---

## DANIEL:

You think I’m sexy?

## MOLLY:

Daniel. For the rest of my life, 

---

when someone asks what I did for my twenty-first birthday, 

---

I can honestly say I spent it in Paris and my Parisian boyfriend took me to dinner 

---

and kissed me on a bridge hanging over the Seine. 

---

And I mean, I guess technically we’re cousins, 

---

but it really is so distant, I won’t mention that part.

---

## DANIEL:

How will you say we met?

---

## MOLLY:

Who cares? I met you in PARIS! 

---

And like, in my wildest dreams, I never pictured that, you know, 

---

if I had a French boyfriend he’d be wearing a Yankees hat 

---

to hide his yarmulke because he didn’t feel safe, 

---

but honestly, that is just a minor detail!

---

## DANIEL:

Don’t leave.

---

## MOLLY:

I mean, I should finish college. That seems important.

---

## DANIEL:

Eh.

## MOLLY:

Says the teacher! 

---

## DANIEL:

Degree, shmegree. 

## MOLLY:

Right, right.

---

## DANIEL:

I’ll be waiting for you, right here.

---

## MOLLY:

Wherever you are.

## DANIEL:

Here.

---

## MOLLY:

Or wherever you are. 

---

## DANIEL:

You don’t mean that. 

## MOLLY:

No?

---

## DANIEL:

No, that’s not how you feel, I know it.

---

## MOLLY:

Oh you do?

---

## DANIEL:

I’m staying, OK – no listen – I’ve decided to –

---

## MOLLY:

No, you listen, Daniel, you – 

---

you want to know how I feel? Listen, I’ll tell you. 

---

Every weekend, for a year now, I got on a train and came to Paris, 

---

and I’d wonder, what was my Great-great-grandma Lucie 
thinking? 

---

How could anyone leave France? My Nana says she wanted adventure, 

---

and got a job as a governess for the Rothschild families, 

---

maybe that’s true. Or, maybe she sensed something, and fled. 

---

I’ll never know. But as frightened as I am about the future 

---

of my own country, I can’t help but feel grateful that she made it her home. 

---

Cause if she hadn’t? I wouldn’t exist.You go wherever you need to to be safe, 

---

because the truth is, you can fight for what’s right wherever you are. 

---

But you have to be alive to do it.

---

## IRMA:

I am dying in the other room. 

---

In fact, I took my last breath just moments ago. 

---

It is March 11th, 1946, and for all time, my tombstone will have 

---

that date permanently etched onto its stone facade.

---

Even I know, there is no sweeter revenge than an old Jew 

---

lying in some forgotten graveyard in Europe with a 

---

tombstone dated nineteen forty-six. 

---

Fuck. You.

---

We are hardly religious, but, as is our tradition, I will be buried in a day or two. 

---

I could have been buried beside my sister, in America, but we left there long ago. 

---

I could have been buried in Havana, or Mexico, had I gone with my daughter, but I didn’t.

---

I could have been dumped like so much meat in a pit beside my granddaughters, 

---

somewhere in Poland, 

---

but instead, I’ll lie here. In France.

---

The country of my birth. 

---

Where my parents are buried, and their parents, and their parents before them.

---

As I fell out of consciousness just now, I could hear my son Lucien,

---

consoling Adolphe in the other room, 

---

and that did soothe me,

---

listening to his voice through the wall. 

---

My life didn’t flash before my eyes, it was more like, things blurred together, 

---

moments profound and mundane: 

---

my fingers on the keyboard of my piano,

---

the view of France, from the deck of the boat, 

---

as we returned from America, the key in the mailbox, 

---

opening it to discover a postcard from my sister, 

---

the meals I cooked my family,the dishes I washed and put away, 

---

then took back down to serve another meal, and washed and put away, 

---

the sound of my husband, up in the middle of the night, 

---

fumbling his way in the dark to the bathroom, 


---

sirens and voices chanting and boots marching in unison as they pounded the streets of Paris,

---

paper, turning the page of a book, 

---

dry leaves blowing in a gust of wind and falling to the ground,

---

and though I don’t pray much I found myself just now saying a prayer – 

---

it was only a word but in that one word lives all my hope,

---

for my family, my country, the future, peace, acceptance, 

---

love and understanding, forward motion, generations. 

---

As I took my last breath on Earth, my head resting comfortably on the pillow, 

---

I looked up and said my one-word prayer. To the ceiling,

---

and the sky above that, and to God above it all,

----

to anyone who might hear I closed my eyes and I said: 

---

Pierre.

---

[Somber Music]

---

## PIERRE:

Why?

---

## MARCELLE:

For a lot of reasons. 

---

For all the reasons I just said. 

---

But Patrick isn’t going anywhere.

---

## PATRICK:

You couldn’t pay me to move to the Middle East. 

---

## MARCELLE:

So he’ll be here, and it’s a very easy flight, 

---

and I’ll be back, and of course, anytime you want to visit us, you can. 

---

Or not. Up to you. 

---

Papa. 

---

Say something.

---

## PIERRE:

What should I say? You do what you need to, honey.

---

## MARCELLE:

I know. But I want you to – I want you to know you can come with us.

---

## PIERRE:

Why would I come with you?

---

## MARCELLE:

If you want. It’s an option. If – if you didn’t feel safe –

---

## CHARLES:

We’re concerned it may not be safe here anymore. 

---

## PIERRE:

It’s never been safe. Not anywhere. You know that. 

---

## MARCELLE:

But it feels like it’s starting to get worse.

---

## PIERRE:

Yes, it does.

## CHARLES:

And it could get even worse.

---

## PIERRE:

It could. Who knows? No one knows the future. 

---

I don’t know what will happen fifteen days from now, do you?

---

## CHARLES:

We don’t, but it doesn’t feel like, 

---

it doesn’t seem like things are headed in a good direction.

---

## PIERRE:

Have things ever been headed in a good direction?

----

France is one of the best countries for Jews, it really is, when you compare it.

---

## PATRICK:

It is. 


---

## PIERRE:

Three-fourths of French Jews survived. 

---

You know what a high percentage that is? 

---

It was so much worse in Poland, in Germany, Czechoslovakia, Greece. France is the one of the best.

---

## PATRICK:

That’s absolutely right.

---

## MARCELLE:

Patrick.

## PATRICK:

What?

---

## MARCELLE:

Please?

## PATRICK:

I know – 

---

Papa, I know that you’ve relied on Marcelle for a lot of things over the years, 

---

and so –

## PIERRE:

I have not!

---

## MARCELLE:

Not relied on – but I’ve helped, I’ve, I’ve been there –

---

## PIERRE:

No one’s helped me, I’ve done just fine on my own.

---

## CHARLES:

What he’s trying to say –

## MARCELLE:

Forget it, forget it –

---

## PATRICK:

What we’re trying to say is, I’m not going anywhere, 

---

I’m staying right here in Paris, so, anything you need, you come to me. Nice.

---

## CHARLES:

We are just trying to do what’s best for the children.

---

## PIERRE:

Well you have to. You have to. Is this about me? Don’t worry about me. 

---

My mother, she refused to leave without Grandfather Nathan, 

---

but he was too old to travel, so we stayed, and that was not a good decision. 

---

Old people are such a pain in the ass that way, you know?

---

## MARCELLE:

So, Papa: We are leaving before the end of summer.

---

## CHARLES:

Doctors can transfer their degrees now, Marcelle and I should both be able to practice.

---

## PIERRE:

And you will teach? 

---

## MARCELLE:

I will have to give that up. 

## CHARLES:

For now.

---

## MARCELLE:

For forever, probably.

## CHARLES:

You don’t know.

---

## MARCELLE:

I know. I still have to learn Hebrew fluently, which…

---

## PIERRE:

You can learn. Our cousins came back from the war speaking beautiful Spanish. 

---

And they hadn’t spoken a word when they left. 

---

This one will learn in two seconds, she’s so bright. 

---

A change will be good for you, I think.

---

## ELODIE:

I think so too. 

---

## DANIEL:

And the store? 

---

## CHARLES:

What about it?

---

## DANIEL:

That’s it? That’s the end? We’re just gonna let it die?

---

## ELODIE:

He’s right here, Daniel, he’s still running it.

---

## DANIEL:

Almost two centuries, five generations – no one cares?

---

## MARCELLE:

Of course we care, of course I do –

## DANIEL:

No one wants to keep it going? 

---

## PATRICK:

You want to run a piano store? 

---

## DANIEL:

Maybe.

## MARCELLE:

Patrick – no – Daniel – 

---

## DANIEL:

Maybe I do!

---

## MARCELLE:

You do not! 

---

You don’t even like pianos, you play guitar –

---

## DANIEL:

Well maybe I want to sell them – 

## MARCELLE:

You don’t know what you want! 

---

## CHARLES:

Marcelle.

## MARCELLE:

He doesn’t! 

---

You want to be Orthodox, you want to be a math teacher, you want to live in Israel, you want to sell pianos –

---

## DANIEL:

I never said I want to live to Israel I never said that!

---

## CHARLES:

OK well I don’t have the transcript handy but it certainly seemed to me like you wanted to go –

---

## MARCELLE:

That’s why we’re going! That’s the whole reason! For you! We’re going for –

---

## DANIEL:

For yourselves. For yourselves.

## PIERRE:

I feel like I’m fifteen again.

---

## PATRICK:

They’re loud, huh? 

## MARCELLE:

Shut up Patrick. 

---

## PATRICK:

Why don’t you shut up? 

---

## PIERRE:

You want to sell pianos? 

## MARCELLE:

Of course he doesn’t. 

---

## PIERRE:

It’s a difficult life.

## DANIEL:

I know.

---

## MARCELLE:

No! This is not – we are not doing this –

---

## PATRICK:

Papa’s trying to speak will you let Papa speak. 

---

## PIERRE:

You don’t want to run the store. I didn’t want to.

---

The store is why we didn’t leave. We couldn’t. 

---

We would have starved. Everything we had was in those pianos. 

---

So we stayed. And paid the price. Of course, I survived, and why? 

---

Papa. Right from the start, I was 154982, he was 154983, 

---

and that’s how it was the whole time, always he was right behind me. 

---

I wouldn’t have made it otherwise, because Papa was an optimist. 

---

He was a natural born salesman. Not like me. 

---

I’m a pessimist. But Papa always stayed hopeful.

---

That first winter, he said, “don’t worry, we’ll be home for Christmas.” 

---

But December came and went, we were still in Poland, that year and the next. 

---

Then spring came, 1945, we were liberated, by Christmas we were back in Paris – 

---

and my father turned to me with a big grin and said, 

---

“See. I told you we’d be home.”

---

Then Papa wanted me to come work with him. 

---

He didn’t understand my resistance. 

---

I couldn’t tell him, each night before bed, I heard my mother’s voice, 

---

calling out from wherever people go when they’re gone: 

---

“Forget the pianos. Learn something you can do anywhere. 

---

Study, Pierre. Study engineering. That’s right.”

---

I didn’t know what to do. But in the end, I went with Papa. 

---

There’s no good reason. I just wanted to be near him. 

---

Because once Grandfather Adolphe died, I was all he had and he was all I had. 

---

And we were together like that until the day I married your grandmother. 

---

I went from one optimist’s home to another, and that was good for me. 

---

I needed that. Because after ’45, no one wanted to hear about the war. 

---

But at the store, I could keep them all alive. 

---

I could hang a picture of Colette, presenting flowers to the President of France, Albert Lebrun. 

---

And you know something? No one has ever looked at the photo and asked, “where’s your sister?”

---

Papa has been dead more than fifty years. 

---

I have kept the store going all this time, longer than anyone who came before me. 

---

And once again, Papa has saved my life, 

---

because if I had become an engineer, at some office, I would have felt very alone. 

---

Instead, I go to work each day, I see the pianos, the old advertisements, 

---

I see our name on the door, and I know they are with me. 

---

And I go on. 

---

Stay together. Stay with your parents. 

---

You have to. In the end, it saved my life.

---

## MARCELLE:

Papa.

---

## PIERRE:

It’s alright, sweetheart.

---

## MARCELLE:

I just… I wish I knew, knew for sure what the right thing to do was, 

---

I… Do you think we – am I a coward?

---

## PIERRE:

No. No. You have to trust your instincts, that’s all you have. 

---

If your instincts tell you time to go, it’s time to go.

---

You must go with your parents, yes?

---

## DANIEL:

Yes.

---

## PIERRE:

Daniel. You’re a thinking person: why do they hate us? 

---

## DANIEL:

I don’t know, Grandpa. Cause we’re different? 

---

We’re not like them? And we don’t want to be like them… 

---

And they don’t understand why…

---

## ELODIE:

Is it because they think we think we’re better than them?

---

In which case, they’ll show us.

---

Or do they think we know something they don’t? 

---

In which case, what exactly do we know? They hate us for that.

---

## CHARLES:

It’s because of Christ? They hate us for killing him.

---

## ELODIE:

We didn’t kill Christ.

## CHARLES:

I know, but –

---

## ELODIE:

They made us slaves in Egypt long before Christ.

---

## CHARLES:

I know, but then they hated us for “killing” him.

---

Then they hated us for not believing in him. 

---

Then they just hated us 

---

so they made us do the most unholy thing they could think of: lend money, and when we learned to do that, 

---

they hated us for learning how to do something they forced us to do.

---

## PATRICK:

It’s about money.When we have it, they hate us for having it.

---

When we don’t, they hate us for being poor, filthy, disgusting, a drain on society.

---

They hate us for being capitalists, they hate us for being communists. 

---

It doesn’t matter.

---

If it has to do with money, they need someone to blame, so they blame us. Then they hate us.

---

## CHARLES:

They hate us when we live in their countries, they hate us when we make our own country.

---

## ELODIE:

They hate us for controlling everything, which is confusing, 

---

cause they’ve been pretty successful at killing us the last two thousand years,

---

if we controlled everything wouldn’t we have done 

---

a better job of at least controlling how often they kill us? 

---

But. Most of all,t hey hate us because they cannot understand how we are still here. 

---

How is it possible?

---

We have been attacked, beaten, burned, converted, expelled, robbed, raped, 

---

gassed, enslaved, tortured, for thousands of years, and still, we are here. We are still here. How? 

---

Are we all Houdinis? Saw us in half, somehow we’re still alive. 

---

Annihilate us in your gas chambers, we’ll send back Elie Wiesel, 

---

Primo Levi, even our dead girls’ diaries are masterpieces.

---

The world wants us dead and in return what do we give them? 

---

Einstein and Freud, Kafka and Proust, Arendt, Chagall.

---

Names that ring out like planets, Universes of thought and genius. 

---

And still, they hate hatehate hate hate us.

---

## DANIEL:

But I won’t hate them back.

---

## MARCELLE:

And we won’t. OK? We won’t. 

---

It’s gonna be great. OK? Hey – it’s gonna be great.

---

[Somber piano music]

---

## PATRICK:

I was not there, later that summer, the morning they left, to say goodbye. 

---

They packed their things, took almost all the furniture, save the piano. 

---

Too heavy to transport. And there’s no room for it at my place. 

---

We’ll have to bring it to my father’s store, on Rue du Fabourg Montmartre, 

---

so he can try to sell it. 

---

Pianos Salomon spans five generations, it has been open more than a hundred and sixty years, 

---

and you can find my father there Tuesdays through Saturdays, 

---

eleven to noon, two- thirty to seven. 

---

[Music Continues]

---

## CHARLES:

This is the bread of affliction, the poor bread,

---

which our ancestors ate, in the land of – France.

---

## DANIEL:

These aren’t even that good. 

---

[Pinging soung]

---

## MARCELLE:

Be right there.

---

## PATRICK:

I love you with all my heart Marcelle, though you won’t hear me say it. 

---

You’ll be ten thousand meters in the air when I think of it, 

---

I know what time your flight is and I’ll look up, 

---

hoping to see your plane, before it crosses the Mediterranean, 

---

in the latest incarnation of our family’s wanderings.

[Rain]

---

I don’t know what will become of her, of me, of France, of the world. 

---

But I am rooting for her, and all the wanderers of the Earth. 

---

There will be many more in the years to come, from all walks of life, 

---

and I am rooting for them – for all of us. 

---

And I will say a prayer – yes, even me, your nonbelieving brother. 

---

What is a prayer anyway, but speaking aloud your hope?
