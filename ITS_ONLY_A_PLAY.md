IT'S ONLY A PLAY<br>

---

## GUS:
Mr. Piper? It's me again. Guess who just walked in down there and handed me his coat? Al Pacino!
---
Can you believe it? This place is crawling with famous people. Barack Obama looked right at me and asked me for a glass of Dom Perignon.
---
I told him I was taking coats. My first night in New York and I'm High-Fiving Denzel Washington.
---
I'm pretty sure I saw Gwyneth Paltrow talking to the Pope. Thank you for this opportunity, Mr. Piper, this could be the break I needed.
---
I got the talent, sir. All I need is the opportunity to show it.

---

## JAMES:
Wasn't it wonderful? Yes! I'll be right down. Thank you!

---

## GUS:
I've seen this one somewhere, too. The guest bathroom is across the hall.

---

## JAMES:
I'm taking a phone call. I couldn't hear a thing in that mob down there.

---

## GUS:
Someone needs this, Mr. Piper, I gotta go.

---

## JAMES:
That's all right, take your time.

---

## GUS:
It's all yours, sir.

---

## JAMES:
Thank you. Hello? Hello?

---

## GUS:
Push the button.

---

## JAMES:
The button, of course! I'd almost forgotten how these things work.
---
I dropped my cell phone getting out of the limo and it went completely dead on me. I haven't felt this cut off since I was in rehab.
---
That was a joke.

---

## GUS:
Yes, sir. Were you in the play tonight?

---

## JAMES:
I don't think so. That was another joke. No, I'm just a guest.

---

## GUS:
Yes, sir.

---

## JAMES:
Hello! This is Jimmy Wicker again, Kylie....
---
Terrible weather, just terrible. We're having a blizzard. To think I used to put up with this!
---
....How long has she been on with him? Yes, I'll hold.
---
California. They're all dying to know how the play went tonight

---

## GUS:
Everyone is. Mrs. Budder is calling this the party of the year for the play of the season.

---

## JAMES:
That's our Julia.

---

## GUS:
What did you think?

---

## JAMES:
Wonderful, just wonderful.

---

## GUS:
Too bad you're not a critic.

---

## JAMES:
Tonight everyone's a critic. You haven't seen the play?

---

## GUS:
I'm temporary help. This is a one-night stand for me.

---

## JAMES:
Tonight is a one-night stand for a lot of people. That was my last joke.

---

## GUS:
That's okay, sir, one of these days I'll get one. Hi, I'm Gus.

---

## JAMES:
James Wicker but everyone calls me Jimmy. Hello! Hello! False alarm. Are you in the business, Gus?

---

## GUS:
No, sir, I'm an actor.

---

## JAMES:
I didn't mean to pry.

---

## GUS:
I'm an inter-disciplinary theatre artist.

---

## JAMES:
So you 're an unemployed actor.

---

## GUS:
I'm an actor-slash-singer-slash-dancer-slash-comedian-slash-performance artist-slash-mime. I have a black belt in karate and can operate heavy farm equipment. 

---

Other skills, on request. Favorite role to date: Konstantin in Anton Chekhov's The Seagull.

---

## JAMES:
I'm still with the heavy farm equipment.

---

## GUS:
Tractors, threshers, reapers, sowers!

---

## JAMES:
That must come in handy.

---

## GUS:
Not so far.

---

## JAMES:
I was thinking ahead: The Cherry Orchard.

---

## GUS:
Once you’ve done Chekhov, you don't want to do anything else.

---

## JAMES:
That's what Madonna said. I've never done any Chekhov myself.

---

## GUS:
Are you an actor?

---

## JAMES:
I am.

---

## GUS:
Are you Equity?

---

## JAMES:
Equity, SAG-AFTRA, ASPCA.

---

## GUS:
Wow.

---

## JAMES:
I'm on a series, Out On A Limb.

---

## GUS:
Wow. A television series?

---

## JAMES:
ABC. Wednesday at nine.

---

## GUS:
Wow.

---

## JAMES:
We just wrapped our 9th season.

---

## GUS:
Wow.

---

## JAMES:
I play a man who has a way with small children and animals. It takes place on a farm for orphans. It's funny and touching. I'm very proud of it.

---

## GUS:
Wow.

---

## JAMES:
And here I am, 5-Best-Actor-Emmy-nominations-later eagerly awaiting the reception of my best friend's play.

---

## GUS:
You're Mr. Austin's best friend?

---

## JAMES:
We were hungry young theatre wannabes suckling at the fecund breast of the not-for-profits -- Playwrights Horizons, Manhattan Theatre Club, the Public. 

---

Those were the days, Gus. I went West, young man, but we've stayed best friends.

---

## GUS:
Wow. That's a beautiful story. I love playwrights.

---

## JAMES:
Wait till you work with one.

---

## GUS:
Ryan Seacrest, wow!

---

## JAMES:
He's one of my best friends.

---

## GUS:
Wow.

---

## JAMES:
We're in the same Pilates class.

---

## GUS:
Wow.

---

## JAMES:
We both dated Ellen DeGeneres.

---

## GUS:
Wow.

---

## JAMES:
I'll give you a hundred dollars if you stop saying "Wow." Hello? Hello! She's just finishing up: Is this your first big Broadway opening?

---

## GUS:
My first anything. I just got here. There I was, wandering around Times Square, looking pretty green with my suitcase when a total stranger approached me: 

---

a producer-slash-agent-slash-photographer. He could have approached anyone but he approached me.

---

## JAMES:
Wow. That's a real New York story.

---

## GUS:
He got me this job tonight and he's going to take some pictures of me when I get back.

---

## JAMES:
When you get back?

---

## GUS:
I'm staying with him. He keeps a spare room for people like me. Maybe you know him, Peter Piper?

---

## JAMES:
No, but I know the type. This town's going to eat you alive..

---

## GUS:
Right away, sir.

---

## JAMES:
What in God's name is that?

---

## GUS:
The dog.

---

## JAMES:
What dog?

---

## GUS:
Mrs. Budder's dog, Torch. He got out and bit that woman who's on TV all the time.

---

## JAMES:
Not Oprah?

---

## GUS:
No, the other one.

---

## JAMES:
Torch bit Kelly Rippa?

---

## GUS:
He went straight for her face.

---

## JAMES:
That’s terrible. I'm supposed to be on her show tomorrow.

---

## GUS:
They took her to Mt. Sinai along with Mr. Budder.

---

## JAMES:
What happened to Mr. Budder?

---

## GUS:
He got mugged before the play tonight.

---

## JAMES:
Hold on, darling, this is too good. Where was he mugged?

---

## GUS:
In the men's room at Sardi's. They're a very old restaurant. I'll be right up with your drink, sir.

---

## JAMES:
I'm in New York at an opening night party sitting in the townhouse of a Broadway producer whose dog bit Kelly Rippa and whose husband got mugged in the men's room at Sardi's. 

---

Meanwhile there's a raging blizzard and a cab strike. I will never knock Los Angeles again. Where was I? Oh, the play!

---

Virginia screams

---

## JAMES:
You were wonderful tonight, Miss Noyes, just wonderful. I was just telling the Coast how wonderful you were.

---

## VIRGINIA:
You got the Coast on there? Give me that thing!

---

## JAMES:
Only if you ever want to make another motion picture.

---

## VIRGINIA:
After tonight? No way. I showed them who's finished. Excuse me.

---

## JAMES:
Virginia Noyes. They drummed her out of Hollywood and she came crawling back to Broadway. 

---

The theatre has become the Statue of Liberty for movie actors: "Give us your tired, your poor, your washed up, your strung out." 

---

...I know, I should bite my tongue. There but for the grace of God go all of us. Oh my God, the dog! Miss Noyes! Miss Noyes!

---

## JAMES:
Be careful of that dog in there.

---

## JAMES:
There's a vicious dog in there.

---

## JAMES:
On the floor, I should think!

---

## JAMES:
Be careful.

---

## JAMES:
I think she's making crystal meth in there. She's the poster child for modern pharmaceuticals. You name it, she's swallowed it. 

---

Listen, what were our ratings like? I told the network not to put us in that time slot. I can't compete with a reality show; I'm a human being. 

---

They can't cancel us. I'm having the swimming pool moved. Don't they know what that costs?

---

..... I'll kill myself. Tell ABC I'll kill myself.... Please, Suzi, I don't need the stress. I'm here to celebrate the opening of my best friend's play. 

---

I'll be back late tomorrow. We'll strategize. Yes, mother. Yes, yes, yes. Big kisses. Ciao.

---

## JAMES:
Don't tell me, let me guess: Tommy Tune.

---

## GUS:
I'm sorry, sir?

---

## JAMES:
Gus, if you want to be in the theatre, you've got to know something about it. 

---

One, Tommy Tune is a very tall, legendary director of musical theatre who hasn't had a show in 45 years but no matter. 

---

Two, you've got to stop calling everyone "sir". Unless we're British, we don't like it.

---

## GUS:
Yes, sir.

---

## JAMES:
We like ''darling" or "Honey" or "angel" or ''Pussycat" or "cupcake" or "love" or "lamb" or "petal."

---

## GUS:
Yes, sir. I forgot your bourbon, lil' nipper.

---


## JAMES: 
I think I've made a terrible mistake! That's all right, Gus, I'll go myself.

---

## GUS:
Mrs. Budder asked you to wait for her up here. She just got back from the hospital and wants to speak to you about something in confidence.

---

## JAMES:
But I'm missing the party.

---

## VIRGINIA:
Good boy.

---

## VIRGINIA:
Dogs love Valium. I took my Irish Wolfhound to New Zealand and he didn't wake up till we were three weeks into the shoot

---

## JAMES:
I think we've heard the last of Torch.

---

## VIRGINIA:
You through with this? I need a land-line. If I call from a cell phone, they can't trace where I'm calling from.

---

## JAMES:
Who are you trying to call?

---

## VIRGINIA:
My parole officer. Hello! This is Virginia Noyes. I'm at my opening night party. I'm being a good girl. ... I'm calling you from 212.....

---

## GUS:
Is that who I think it is? She's my favorite actress after Sissy Spacek.

---

## JAMES:
That's the first interesting thing you've said all evening.

---

## GUS:
She was amazing in that movie.

---

## JAMES:
She was good.

---

## GUS:
That scene with the frogs! She thanked them in her Oscar speech.

---

## VIRGINIA:
I don't have to call in again for another couple of hours. For a while they had me checking in every 15 minutes. What did they think I was going to do?

---

## JAMES:
No, thank you, I had some at home.

---

## VIRGINIA:
You sweetheart?

---

## GUS:
I gotta stay on the ball tonight

---

## VIRGINIA:
Take this before I want more.

---

## GUS:
I love your work, Miss Noyes.

---

## VIRGINIA:
Thanks. I'm sure I'll love yours.

---

## JAMES:
Don't get him started.

---

## GUS:
The scene with the frogs.

---

## VIRGINIA:
Those goddamn frogs. That's all anybody talks about! Bring me a vodka stinger and I'll tell you all about those frogs.

---

## GUS:
Coming right up, pussycat.

---

## VIRGINIA:
He's cute -- too familiar but cute.

---

## JAMES:
He didn't have a clue who I was.

---

## VIRGINIA:
Who are you?

---

## JAMES:
I'm James Wicker.

---

## VIRGINIA:
James Wicker.

---

## JAMES:
We did a film together.

---

## VIRGINIA:
When?

---

## JAMES:
Elegy For Myself

---

## VIRGINIA:
Were you in that?

---

## JAMES:
I was your psychotherapist.

---

## VIRGINIA:
They had one on the set for me?

---

## JAMES:
I was in the movie.

---

## VIRGINIA:
James Wicker! Of course! We had to do all those re-takes because I was coming off Percocet.

---

## JAMES:
You kept falling asleep on my couch.

---

## VIRGINIA:
Hello, hello, how the hell are you? I love your work. I love it, I love it, I love it.

---

## JAMES:
Back at you.

---

## VIRGINIA:
You son of a bitch! When they sent me Peter's play, they told me you were doing Jack's part. You were one of the reasons I signed.

---

## JAMES:
There was some talk about it, they wanted me desperately, actually, but with my series...

---

## VIRGINIA:
You've got a series?

---

## JAMES:
Nine years now. Out On A Limb.

---

## JAMES:
I just take the money and run.

---

## JAMES:
I was going to ask you the same question.

---

## VIRGINIA:
I am fan-fucking-tastic. Living in L.A. so long, you forget what being on a real stage is like. 

---

No place to run, no place to hide, no re-takes. Just you in a pool of light and Him.

---

## JAMES:
Him?

---

## VIRGINIA:
God.

---

## JAMES:
Oh, that him.

---

## VIRGINIA:
The thing about theatre is this: it's actually happening at the very moment it IS.

---

## JAMES:
You just figured that out?

---

## VIRGINIA:
It blew my mind. I was in a play tonight. My performance didn't walk out the door with the dailies. 

---

It was there, not for all time, but just for the moment. You had to be there to see it. 

---

Talk about existential. Fuck me, Jean-Paul Sartre, fuck me. I bet you miss all this.

---

## JAMES:
Not really. I’m too old, too rich and too famous. Eight shows a week is a lot of work.

---

## VIRGINIA:
I'm only doing six. l don't even get the concept of a matinee. My agents said I was crazy to do a play.

---

## JAMES:
A lot of people would agree. Wild horses couldn't get me up there again.

---

## VIRGINIA:
Well, my loins are girded. Come on, I'll buy you a drink.

---

## JAMES:
I'd love to but I'm waiting for our hostess.

---

## VIRGINIA:
If Liza sings, you're going to miss it.

---

## JAMES:
You mean there's a chance that she won't?

---

## VIRGINIA:
That's unkind.

---

## JAMES:
I've been on a sit-com so long I think I have to say something funny even when I don't. She's one of my best friends.

---

## VIRGINIA:
She's a cunt. I mean that in the best possible sense of the word.

---

## JAMES:
It must be getting time for the first review on New York 1.

---

## TV ANNOUNCER:
…accumulation of 11 inches. After the break we'll be right back with the first review of tonight's big opening at the Ethel Barrymore…

---

## JAMES:
I dread this. They're gonna crucify him.

---

## FRANK:
They're all phonies down there, Virginia, don't say I didn't warn you!

---

## JAMES:
Opening nights are dreadful -- all that nervous insincerity. This waiting for the reviews is torture. Can you imagine what it must be like for them? I'm James Wicker.

---

## FRANK:
I know who you are.

---

## JAMES:
You're the first person this evening who does. Do you know who's reviewing for New York 1 now?

---

## FRANK:
Some idiot. They're all idiots. It’s a job requirement -- along with dandruff and personal hygiene issues.

---

## JAMES:
They're just doing their job.

---

## FRANK:
Reviews are what's killing the theatre.

---

## JAMES:
Good ones aren't. I'm still trying to get my niece a pair for Wicked.

---

## FRANK:
I'm always cold. I've been cold all my life.

---

## JAMES:
Several thousand dollars, I should think.

---

## FRANK:
Several thousand dollars for a box!

---

## JAMES:
It's more than just a box, it's an antique box.

---

## FRANK:
And Artaud and the Theatre of Cruelty died in total poverty.

---

## JAMES:
I don't think Mrs. Budder personally killed them. Whoever they were, they don't sound like very nice people.

---

## FRANK:
They weren't. That's why the theatre needed them. We're overrun with nice people. 

---

We need shits and sons of bitches if we're ever going to get it right again. What?

---

## JAMES:
I saw that.

---

## FRANK:
So?

---

## JAMES:
You're putting me in an extremely difficult position. Mrs. Budder is one of my closest---.

---

## TV ANNOUNCER:
New York 1's theatre critic was at the Barrymore Theatre for the opening of a new play tonight.

---

## FRANK:
May I have that?

---

## TV ANNOUNCER:
Well, it's like this. Peter Austin's eagerly awaited new play, The Golden Egg, is-

---

## JAMES:
What happened? .

---

## FRANK:
I don't believe in reviews.

---

## JAMES:
Are you crazy? Turn that back on.

---

## TV ANNOUNCER:
... working in an idiom totally dissimilar from his previous plays, Mr. Austin has given us a play that is both-

---

## JAMES:
What is the matter with you?

---

## FRANK:
Watching only encourages them.

---

## JAMES:
I'd like to know what she thinks.

---

## FRANK:
Why do you care?

---

## JAMES:
She's a critic.

---

## FRANK:
She's an asshole.

---

## JAMES:
That's not the point.

---

## FRANK:
What is the point?

---

## JAMES:
What the asshole thinks.

---

## FRANK:
I'd rather know what you thought.

---

## JAMES:
I loved it.

---

## FRANK:
You loved it?

---

## JAMES:
Yes, I loved it! What do you want from me?

---

## FRANK:
Your honest opinion.

---

## JAMES:
All right, my best friend wrote it for me and I turned it down because I thought it was a piece of shit and I want to see if that asshole agrees with me.

---

## FRANK:
Your best friend?

---

## JAMES:
Peter. Peter Austin.

---

## FRANK:
Peter Austin wrote a piece of shit for you?

---

## JAMES:
Not on purpose. In this business, we're all capable of shit.

---

## FRANK:
I know, I've watched your series.

---

## TV ANNOUNCER:
... superb, no, I take that back: perfect staging by Frank Finger; the brilliant young English director who gave us last season's ravishing Arden of Feversham. Thank you and goodnight.

---

## JAMES:
It sounds like she liked it.

---

## FRANK:
Of course she liked it, look who directed it.

---

## JAMES:
Please, don't give me Frank Finger. You're talking to someone who actually sat through his all-male Three Sisters. 

---

I took my poor mother. I think it's what killed her.

---

## FRANK:
I’m Frank Finger.

---

## JAMES:
But it was wonderful, just wonderful. She was very old. Everyone said it was her time. So you're Frank Finger!

---

## FRANK:
It's Sir Frank, actually.

---

## JULIA:
Thank you! Isn't it exciting? I'll be right down.

---

## JAMES:
There she is!

---

## JULIA:
I did it, I did it, I did it! I'm a real live Broadway producer. Look out, Broadway, here comes Julia Budder.

---

## JAMES:
Not only is Julia Budder the luckiest producer in New York, she's also the prettiest.

---

## JULIA:
I am no longer part of the herd of investors who call themselves producers. When they announce the Best Play Tony Award winner this year, it will be just me walking to the podium to accept. 

---

Last year, they counted 85 of us up there. Variety called it The Night of the Locusts. 

---

I will walk with great pride and dignity, blowing kisses to all and sundry, rather like your queen, Sir Frank. 

---

And when I make my acceptance speech, just let that orchesh a dare to cut me off. I'll talk all night if I want to.

---

## FRANK:
Tell Julia what you thought of the play.

---

## JAMES:
I loved it!

---

## JULIA:
Please don't handle that, James. It's extremely delicate.

---

## JAMES:
Thanks to me, you're lucky you still have it.

---

## JULIA:
Have you seen that mob down there? I don't know half of them. I said to one woman, "You look like Hillary Clinton." She said, ''I hope so. I am Hillary Clinton." 

---

You heard New York 1? My first review. "Good solid theatre."

---

## JAMES:
"Good solid theatre.”

---

## JULIA:
You have to imagine it blown up. I was hoping for something with a little more oomph in it but coming from them our press agent says it's a rave.

---

## JAMES:
Who's your press agent?

---

## JULIA:
Buzz, Buzz something. He's tops in his field. You really think we have a chance?

---

## JAMES:
It's going to be the biggest hit on Broadway since God knows when.

---

## JULIA:
God Knows When? Don't tell me! Let me guess. Kaufinan and Hart? Neil Simon? Painter! Harold Painter: God Knows When!

---

## JAMES:
It's a figure of speech, Julia.

---

## JULIA:
Irving Berlin said it best: "There's no business like the one we're in."

---

## JAMES:
You got that almost right.

---

## JULIA:
I’m not budging from this house again tonight. The hospital was a nightmare the first time and then Torch bites Kelly Rippa and it's off to Mount Sinai with her. 

---

I told her, "Relax, Miss Rippa, he just wants to sniff you.''

---

## GUS:
The cast of Hamilton just got here.

---

## JAMES:
Thank you, Gus.

---

## GUS:
No problem, sweetheart.

---

## JAMES:
The young man taking the coats said you wanted to speak to me about something.

---

## JULIA:
I'm very worried about Peter. He didn't take a bow and now he's not at his own party!

---

## JAMES:
What does it say?

---

## JULIA:
I had to promise not to open it until after the reviews were in.

---

## JAMES:
I didn't.

---

## JULIA:
I'll never forgive myself if anything happens to him.

---

## JAMES:
"Dear Julia, Thank you for producing my play. I know it cost you a lot of money, none of which you may ever see again."

---

## JULIA:
The money! As if I cared about that.

---

## JAMES:
"And thank you for your beautiful opening night gift. I have always wanted a pot holder with the name of one of my plays on it."

---

## JULIA:
They're really quite lovely.

---

## JAMES:
"I wish you the best. I even wish Frank breaks a leg?"

---

## JULIA:
That's a theatrical expression. It means good luck.

---

## JAMES:
What does he mean, "even"?

---

## JULIA:
You should've heard some of the names Sir Frank called Peter: Failure. Has-been. Hack.

---

## JAMES:
No!

---

## JULIA:
Loser. Fake. Phony. Written out.

---

## JAMES:
I get the picture, Julia.

---

## JULIA:
I  was just an amateur, dilettante, rich bitch.

---

## JAMES:
Why did you stand for it?

---

## JULIA:
I didn’t. Elliott said "You can't speak to my wife like that," and he punched him right in the mouth.

---

## JAMES:
Good for Elliot.

---

## JULIA:
No, Sir Frank punched Elliot. He knocked him out and then barred him from rehearsals.

---

## JAMES:
As Producer, you should have done something.

---

## JULIA:
I’d already been barred.

---

## JAMES:
This play sounds like a total nightmare.

---

## JULIA:
It's been bliss. Sheer creative bliss.

---

## GUS:
The cast of Hamilton is leaving. They got a better offer.

---

## JAMES:
"As for me, my dearest Julia (and I love you like a mother)--"

---

## JULIA:
And I love him like a son.

---

## JAMES:
"If the reviews aren't good, I don't think I can face anyone, certainly not you. If anything happens to me, you are in no way to blame. 

---

Goodbye. Remember me a little bit. And good luck with the Caryl Churchill."

---

## JULIA:
A new play I've optioned.

---

## JAMES:
"P.S. I still wish you'd given me that turntable in the second act."

---

## JULIA:
Where is he then?

---

## JAMES:
Darling, Peter is a genius at theatrics. You've heard of a late entrance? It's an old stunt. Believe me, I do it all the time. Shall we?

---

## JULIA:
Who do all those coats belong to?

---

## GUS:
The Lion King.

---

## JULIA:
I don't remember inviting The Lion King.

---

## GUS:
They're all saying you've got a big hit on your hands, Mrs. Budder, honey.

---

## JULIA:
From your lips to God's ears. The Chat- Rooms have been brutal to us.

---

## JAMES:
Julia, you go into the Chat Rooms?

---

## JULIA:
Everyone's in the Chat Rooms. I'm the only one who admits it.

---

## JAMES:
Those people are sociopaths.

---

## JULIA:
They buy tickets like everyone else.

---

## GUS:
I'm in the Chat Rooms.

## JULIA:
You see, James?

---

## GUS:
I'm SlaveToSondheiml1.

---

## JULIA:
I'm SondheimFanatic 17.

---

## GUS:
I love your posts.

---

## JULIA:
I love yours.

---

## GUS:
They're having the time of their lives down there. Patti LuPone just finished singing Stormy Weather, and Renee Fleming burst into something from Faust. 

---

You're missing your own party, girlfriend.

---

## JULIA:
We're on our way.

---

## JAMES:
"P.P.S. The play never really had a chance without James Wicker in it. 

---

Of course, he was a son of a bitch not to have done it and I wish him and his stupid series a sudden and violent death, though I personally bear him no hard feelings, the miserable no-talent sitcom fruit.”

---

## JULIA:
You? No-talent? That's ridiculous.

---

## JAMES:
You certainly came off a hell of a lot better than I did.

---

## GUS:
Daniel Radcliffe. But I pretended I didn't know he knew I knew who he was.

---

## JULIA:
You've come at a bad moment, darling.

---

## JAMES:
I'm fine, Julia, let's go. If you can face the Chat Rooms, I can face my best friend's true colors.

---

## GUS:
I was hoping I could sing something tonight.

---

## JULIA:
I don't see why not. If Catherine Zeta-Jones can….!

---

## GUS:
No, up here, for you, an audition.

---

## JULIA:
I don't do musicals. Ever since Mamma Mia, I said to myself, why bother? 

---

But go ahead, I believe we of the theatre should extend a helping hand,whenever we can.

---

## JAMES:
Julia!

---

## JULIA:
I'll only be a moment. What are you going to sing for us, Gus?

---

## GUS:
"Defying Gravity," what else?

---

## JULIA:
My very most-private number. It could only be Elliot.

---

## GUS:
She was going to hear me sing.

---

## JAMES:
I'm sure you're wonderful,just wonderful. They're calling for you downstairs, Gus. I can hear them way up here.

---

## JULIA:
Well of course you're getting good treatment, darling. We gave them a Pavillion.

---

## JAMES:
Your wife's got a big fat hit on her hands, Elliot!

---

## JULIA:
Jimmy Wicker. He flew all the way in for the opening.

---

## JAMES:
Fuck you, too, Elliot. Julia! The party!

---

## JULIA:
Darling, I was talking to our broker during intermission and he thinks we should pull out of that surgical supplies factory in the Dominican Republic, 

---

while we're ahead and consider buying up those Toyota dealerships in Zaire. 

---

That's exactly what I told him: people can live without a scalpel but not without their cars

---

....Mmmmmm ....Mmmmmm ... Mmmnnn.

---

## JAMES:
Bluestocking a new play by Caroline Comstock.

---

## JAMES:
The lights come up on a green chair. It is empty. A woman screams in the distance. (Or is it a woman?) We hear a flourish of wind. (Or is it wind?)

---

## IRA:
How do you like it so far?

---

## JAMES:
I'm afraid this room is off limits.

---

## IRA:
I just need a quick word with Mrs. Budder. And talk about killing two birds with one stone!

---

## JAMES:
I beg your pardon.

---

## IRA:
I gave you a wonderful review once.

---

## JAMES:
You did?

---

## IRA:
That little Lorca play off Broadway.

---

## JAMES:
No, that was Gordon Small.

---

## IRA:
Gordon Small, of course. Wonderful actor. I know, Wendy Wasserstein's Uncommon Women?

---

## JAMES:
That's an all female cast.

---

## IRA:
You're right but you never know these days!

---

## JAMES:
Wicker.

---

## IRA:
Hmm?

---

## JAMES:
James Wicker.

---

## IRA:
I know that.

---

## JAMES:
You said Wacker.

---

## IRA:
No!

---

## JAMES:
And you are?

---

## IRA:
I'm sorry. Ira Drew.

---

## JAMES:
The Ira Drew?

---

## IRA:
There's another?

---

## IRA:
You can stop right now, Mr. Wicker. I'm a critic of the old school. 

---

I don't know what I'm going to write about a play until I sit down to write it. 

---

I can't be had for one of Mrs. Budder's pastry puffs, as tasty as they may be. I'm still processing what I saw this evening and I have to keep an open mind. 

---

I admit I have an agenda. There's too many revivals and not enough Brecht. Celebrity wattage does not impress. 

---

A play should have a beginning, a middle and an end. 

---

Plots are important, too, along with interesting characters. Attractive actors with trained voices are always welcome. 

---

In the right context, full frontal nudity has its place. I'd love to see Halle Berry starkers. That's about it.

---

## JAMES:
It was a simple question.

---

## IRA:
Serious theatre criticism has become an endangered species. People read us to find out what they thought of a play. 

---

Now they have opinions of their own and put them on the Internet. 

---

What we are witnessing is the collapse of Western civilization.

---

## JAMES:
I certainly hope not.

---

## IRA:
I call them as I see them. The League of Producers banned me from their press list after my review of the revival of the revival of the revival of Les Mis. 

---

I was ousted from the Critics Circle -- they said I was "too vicious", even for that den of sadists and inverts.

---

## JAMES:
You were always very good to me.

---

## IRA:
You were wonderful. There was no actor of your generation with more promise. Whatever happened to you?

---

## JAMES:
A little invention called television.

---

## IRA:
Ah, well, that would explain it.

---

## JULIA:
I love you, too. Stop, you're making me blush ... I said stop, you're making me blush!

---

## JAMES:
Her husband. He invented something. Richer than God.

---

## JULIA:
That man!

---

## JAMES:
Julia, this is Ira Drew.

---

## JULIA:
Hello.

---

## JAMES:
Ira Drew, The Eviscerator!

---

## JULIA:
That Ira Drew!

---

## IRA:
I'll come right to the point.

---

## JAMES:
Excuse me, Julia, I'll be downstairs.

---

## IRA:
No, stay, this concerns you, too, Mr. Wicker. Mrs. Budder has been sent a new play to consider, a certain Bluestocking.

---

## JULIA:
It came- this morning.

---

## JAMES:
I was just leafing through it.

---

## IRA:
Bluestocking is the best American play I've come across in a long time. 

---

It has humor, depth, wit, wisdom, love, valor, compassion, one set and a cast of two. 

---

The chief theatre critic for the New York Times, Jesse Green, told me on the QT that he loves it..

---

## JULIA:
It sounds like a producer's dream, Mr. Drew.

---

## IRA:
It is, Mrs. Budder.

---

## JAMES:
Next thing you'll be telling us you wrote it.

---

## IRA:
Caroline Comstock wrote Bluestocking. Caroline is only my protegee, nothing more and nothing less.

---

## JULIA:
Why are you telling us this?

---

## JULIA:
Thank you, but I'm concentrating on Peter Austin's day tonight.

---

## GUS:
Aladdin and Rock of Ages.

---

## JAMES:
I thought Rock of Ages closed.

---

## JULIA:
They did but nobody told them. Thank you, Gus.

---

## GUS:
Sure thing, sugar.

---

## IRA:
Can he be trusted? No one must know of this meeting. It is highly unethical: a critic giving a commercial producer an exclusive leak! It would compromise the three of us.

---

## JAMES:
The three of us? What did I do?

---

## IRA:
Bluestocking was written for you, Mr. Wicker.

---

## JAMES:
Two minutes ago, you were wondering what happened to me.

---

## IRA:
Wait'll I tell Miss Comstock I've found you. I place my reputation as an ethical journalist in your hands.

---

## JULIA:
Thank you for your inside lead, Mr. Drew

---

## JAMES:
I'm always looking for the right vehicle!

---

## IRA:
You're holding it.

---

## JAMES:
He's certainly the last person I expected to see here tonight. 

---

"The American theatre would be a better place today if Peter Austin's parents had smothered him in his crib." Ira Drew's review of Flashes.

---

## JULIA:
What a horrible thing to say about anyone, even a playwright.

---

## JAMES:
And then in the same breath, he gave me the review of a lifetime and put me on the map.

---

## JULIA:
I don't know how you people stand it. Thank God, they don't review producers, only our plays.

---

## PETER:
May I come in?

---

## JULIA:
Peter, finally!

---

## PETER:
I don't know how Shakespeare stood this. An evening like this is every playwright's rite of passage. 

---

All my life I dreamed they'd yell "Author! Author!" when I walked into my opening night party. 

---

They did, only it was for Tom Stoppard who was right behind me. 

---

All Broadway and half of Hollywood are down there. Stephen Spielberg asked me if I wanted to write a screenplay for him. 

---

"Sure," I said "What about?" "Good point," he said and walked away.

---

## JAMES:
There he is: America 's oldest living, most promising young playwright. Hello, Peter.

---

## PETER:
Jimmy, you came?

---

## JAMES:
On the goddamn Red Eye. Of course I came!

---

## PETER:
Maybe I can get through all this with my best friend here. I love this man. 

---

I don't care who knows it. I. love this person. I love him, I love him, I love him.

---

## JULIA:
I wish I had a camera.

---

## PETER:
From the bottom of my heart, thank you, Jimmy-Jim-Jimbo

---

## JAMES:
Now where the hell have you been?

---

## JULIA:
You had us both so worried.

---

## PETER:
You promise not to laugh?

---

## JULIA:
Of course not.

---

## PETER:
I've been walking the streets thinking about what it means to be a playwright.

---

## JULIA:
That's so dear.

---

## PETER:
No, I mean it

---

## JULIA:
So do I. That's a wonderful thing to be thinking about. I wish more playwrights did.

---

## PETER:
A Streetcar Named Desire opened at the same theatre we did tonight. December 3, 1947.
---
Tennessee Williams paced nervously at the back of our orchestra, just like I did. I could feel him.
---
Elia Kazan paced with him. I felt them both.
---
I bet they held hands and squealed like school girls when that curtain went up. It's from our stage where Marlon Brando first yelled "Stella" and Blanche Du Bois told the world that she had always depended on the kindness of strangers.
---
We have a lot to live up to tonight. It depends on us to remind this city that there is more to Broadway than guest appearances or special effects and revivals or another play from London or another Disney movie made live.
---
We are an original American play. We must make that count for something.

---

## JULIA:
Amen.

---

## JAMES:
That was beautifully stated, Peter.

---

## PETER:
I'll get off my soapbox now. Before I knew it, the first act was over and everybody was on the sidewalk. I saw you, Jimmy, talking to Bernadette Peters. She was bent over double at something you were saying. It looked like you were imitating a giant chicken. God, you are a funny man.

---

## JAMES:
Too funny by half.

---

## PETER:
The lights flicked on and off.
---
Everyone went in for the 2nd act. That's when I began to take it all in. I was on Broadway. I was part of something bigger than myself. 

---

I was where I'd dreamed of being all my life. I started walking around the theatre district. 

---

So many memories of shows, actors, great productions, As of tonight, I was now a part of them. 

---

I saw that plaque to Eugene O'Neill, "America's Greatest Playwright" was born on this site -- and I knew there would never be such a plaque for any American playwright again, no matter how great a writer he was, unless we did something about it. 

---

We've let Broadway stop mattering and handed it over to the Brits and the movie-to-musical franchises lock, stock and barrel. 

---

It's our fault, not theirs. We all got so greedy. 

---

The theatre became a business to make a million when it should be a place for dialogue between stage and audience about what it means to be alive. 

---

I walked to Shubert Alley, what's left of it, and stood looking at the show posters. 

---

When the Kardashians in Three Sisters is the best we can offer, it's time to weep. With tears in my eyes I looked at the Marriott. 

---

They tore down three theatres to put up a hotel. Who let this happen? You don't get a Salesman or an Oklahoma when you tear down a theatre, you get a Marriott. 

---

When I finally turned back up 45th Street, our play was over and everyone was gone, but our marquee was still lit. 

---

The Golden Egg, a new play by Peter Austin. 

---

I looked at it and thought of Williams and O'Neill and Miller and Albee and I thought, we can tum back the tide. We can make a change. 

---

And then someone turned the lights off and we went dark. End of speech. Sorry, I somehow got back up on it again.

---

## JULIA:
Next play I promise you that turntable.

---

## PETER:
Next play I'm going to want two turntables.

---

## JULIA:
Now can I tell you something and you'll promise not to laugh? 

---

One of the reasons I produced your play- other than it's brilliant and it gave me goose bumps - 
---
is that it doesn't have any 4-letter words in it.

---

## PETER:
I think I got all my 4-letter words out of my system in my first play.

---

## JAMES:
The things he had me saying, Julia!

---

## JULIA:
I'm sorry, but I think the theatre should be a place of elegance.
---
Elegant people in elegant clothes in elegant settings speaking elegant language.

---

## JAMES:
So much for David Mamet.

---

## JULIA:
The last play I saw every other word was the "F" word or the "K" word. I was appalled.

---

## JAMES:
The "K" word? What's the "K" word?

---

## JULIA:
You know: the "K" word.

---

## PETER:
Any word on the reviews?

---

## JULIA:
Just New York 1 and their "good solid theatre".

---

## JAMES:
Kangaroo? Kumquat?

---

## JULIA:
Buzz says he'll have the Times a good half-hour before they post it online.

---

## JAMES:
Ketchup? Kaleidoscope?

---

## PETER:
What about the Chat Rooms?

---

## JULIA:
FiddlerFanatic liked the first act.

---

## JAMES:
Kennebunkport? Knick-knack? This is driving me crazy, Julia.

---

## JULIA:
I'm going to powder my nose before we all go down there.

---

## JAMES:
You look gorgeous.

---

## JULIA:
I won't be a moment. Talk amongst yourselves.

---

## JAMES:
We can thank our lucky stars for people like that.

---

## PETER:
Guess how many times I threw up today? Actually leaned over the bowl and heaved my guts up?

---

## JAMES:
Then don't get too close. They have me in Prada tonight. What are you in? Somebody down there is going to ask you to get them a drink if you're not careful.

---

## PETER:
My father's tails, in his honor,

---

## JAMES:
They're almost in style again. How are your folks?

---

## PETER:
Fine, fine. I thought a Broadway opening would be too much for them. They'll be happy you came. Where are you staying?

---

## JAMES:
The Sherry, the Four Seasons was full.

---

## PETER:
The Sherry!

---

## JAMES:
The network's paying. Did you invite any of the old gang?

---

## PETER:
No, just you. We're practically the only ones still in the business. I've lost track of most of them. 

---

I wanted you up there on that stage so bad tonight. We were going to do this Broadway thing together.

---

## JAMES:
Who knew an iffy pilot would turn into 9 years of my life?

---

## PETER:
We waited as long as we could for you.

---

## JAMES:
I know.

---

## PETER:
But Jack was marvelous, don't you think?

---

## JAMES:
Absolutely.

---

## PETER:
The Tony Award tom-toms are already throbbing!

---

## JAMES:
Not that marvelous. That part has my name written all over it. But he was wonderful, just wonderful. 

---

I would have been more wonderful, it's true.

---

## PETER:
I felt so ... bereft when you went to LA. I had such a talent crush on you.

---

## JAMES:
It was mutual.

---

## PETER:
I didn't know what I was going to do. No one hears me like you. I thought you were the best actor I'd ever worked with. I was afraid when you left you took my talent with you. 

---

That's why tonight is so important to me. I did it without you.

---

## JAMES:
We'll do something together again, I'm sure of it.

---

## PETER:
You really liked the play?

---

## JAMES:
Peter, I'm the last one to ask. I was a talented character actor, one of thousands in this city, when I met you.
---
I would have gone on having ten lines in each act for the rest of my life. Maybe I would have played Willy Loman or Iceman in a regional theatre. 

---

But I would have gone on thinking I was lucky: I was a working actor.
---
Then you went and wrote FLASHES for me. When I finished it, I was overwhelmed, it was extraordinary, but I thought "He'll get someone else for it. 

---

They'll make him get someone else for it." But you didn't.
---
Make no mistake: I'm a very lucky man and I know it.

---

## PETER:
I'm lucky I saw you do those ten lines in that weird play at the Cherry Lane.

---

## JAMES:
It was fourteen lines. I was on a roll that season.

---

## JULIA:
May I come out?

---

## JAMES:
Julia, who do you have to fuck to get something to eat around here?

---

## JULIA:
Me, darling!

---

## PETER:
Look to your laurels, Mr. Tony Kushner, here comes the next generation. Shall we go down?

---

## JAMES:
I'll be surprised if there's anything left.

---

## VIRGINIA:
That fucking Channel 5. I told a roomful of people to shut up so they could hear someone say "Virginia Noyes stinks."

---

## JULIA:
I'm sure Channel 5 didn't say "Virginia Noyes stinks." Maybe something like it but not those exact words.

---

## VIRGINIA:
"Virginia Noyes stinks." You could hear a pin drop when she said it.
---
"Virginia Noyes stinks." Do I, Peter? Do I stink?

---

## PETER:
You were wonderful - everything I could have asked for and more.

---

## VIRGINIA:
I know you took a chance on me when not many people would have., I love our play.
---
It's bold, it's beautiful. I wanted to be a  part of it.
---
But above all, I didn't want to let you down; you of all people.
---
I'd never forgive myself.

---

## PETER:
You could never let me down. You were my first and only choice for this

---

## VIRGINIA:
I'm feeling very fragile right now.

---

## JULIA:
Peter's right, you were wonderful, darling. No matter what happens with the critics, you must never forget that, you were wonderful.
---
Do I know you?

---

## JULIA:
It's Julia, darling, your producer.

---

## VIRGINIA:
Oh, yeah, right, hi, thanks. You want a hit?

---

## JULIA:
Don't ask silly questions. Of course I want a hit. Everyone at this party does.

---

## JAMES:
It's not what you're thinking, Julia.

---

## VIRGINIA:
I have definitely earned one. Wicker?

---

## PETER:
Nothing.

---

## VIRGINIA:
I know that look from the rehearsal room. You want to say something about my performance.

---

## PETER:
It's a good thing I'm not an actor -- I have no subtext. Okay...

---

## VIRGINIA:
What?

---

## PETER:
It's so small.

---

## VIRGINIA:
Tell me.

---

## PETER:
I'm sure I'm the only one who noticed.

---

## JULIA:
I think Peter means when you dropped the bottle,

---

## VIRGINIA:
I didn't drop the fucking bottle. It fucking slipped.

---

## PETER:
In the calico quilt speech, you said "could" twice instead of would and then could just once.

---

## VIRGINIA:
What should I have said?

---

## PETER:
Actually what I wrote was "would". first and then "could" with the slightest inflection on "could". The "would" allows the "could" in her emotional progression. Would, could. You hear the difference?

---

## VIRGINIA:
Jesus H. Christ! You going to bring me up on Equity charges?

---

## PETER:
Jimmy never changed one word of my text and he completely respected my punctuation.

---

## VIRGINIA:
You want a parrot or a performance?

---

## PETER:
I want both.

---

## JAMES:
I was never a parrot.

---

## JAMES:
What was that?

---

## JULIA:
It sounded like the window. Do you see anyone?

---

## JAMES:
Across the street. There are kids throwing snowballs.

---

## VIRGINIA:
This would never happen in California.

---

## JAMES:
What's the matter with you? Are you crazy? This is a private home!

---

## PETER:
Who are they? Street toughs?

---

## JULIA:
It's the cast of Matilda.

---

## JAMES:
Now can we please go downstairs and eat?

---

## PETER:
There he is! My genius director. We all see you under there. Your famous Japanese Noh Theatre techniques aren't working, Sir Frank!

---

## FRANK:
Who is James Franco and why is he sexting me?

---

## VIRGINIA:
James Franco sexts everyone.

---

## JAMES:
He thinks he's invisible under that?

---

## JULIA:
He sat like that for days in rehearsal. Brilliant. After a while it was like he actually wasn't there.

---

## PETER:
I'm difficult to work with and you're close to impossible. It's a marriage made in Heaven and l'm sending you my next play.

---

## FRANK:
If one more person tells me I'm a genius, I'll punch them, Julia!

---

## JULIA:
But you are a genius, darling, that's why we hired you.

---

## FRANK:
You hired me because I always get good reviews.

---

## JAMES:
That's a pretty good reason.

---

## FRANK:
I don't know what I'm doing but you wait and see: I'll win a Tony for this.

---

## JULIA:
I certainly hope so.

---

## FRANK:
I've had 14 hits in a row in London, I've won 12 Olivier and 4 Evening Standard Awards. I want a flop. I need a flop. Somebody, tell me: when is it my turn to fail? I can't go on like this - the critics' darling.

---

## JULIA:
Try to hold on just one more night.

---

## FRANK:
I am in despair, people. The Emperor isn't wearing any clothes! I'm a fake. My work is a fake. I make this shit up as I go along. I don't know what I'm doing half the time and when I do, it terrifies me it's so bad. rm no good. You've got to believe me, I'm no good.

---

## JAMES:
I believe you. Can we go down now, Julia?

---

## JULIA:
We can't leave him like this.

---

## FRANK:
The only flops I've ever had were at drama school. Nobody liked my production of anything. My Space Age Oedipus Rex. 

---

My spoken La Boheme. My gay Waiting For Godot. But what got me expelled was my Titus Andronicus. 

---

I did the whole thing in mime. No dialogue. No poetry. No Shakespeare.

---

## VIRGINIA:
What did it have?

---

## FRANK:
Blood bags. Every time somebody walked on stage: splat! They got hit with a big blood bag. God, it was gross.

---

## VIRGINIA:
It sounds fantastic.

---

## FRANK:
It was terrible. But at least everyone said it was terrible. I'm pulling the same stunts in New York and everybody says it's brilliant.

---

## VIRGINIA:
It is brilliant.

---

## FRANK:
I hate it! God I miss RADA.

---

## JULIA:
The Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts.

---

## JAMES:
I'm sure RADA misses you. Does anybody remember what food tastes like? Julia, I'll die if I don't eat something.

---

## FRANK:
I don't want these things. Please don't leave them around.

---

## JULIA:
Sir Frank, that's my sterling silver pepper shaker. My priceless bud vase. Little Elliot's bronzed baby shoes!

---

## JAMES:
You don't happen to have a sandwich in there, do you?

---

## FRANK:
My therapist is supposed to be helping me with this! You know what she tells me? "Put it back, Frank."

---

## JULIA:
She's right! Put it back, Frank

---

## FRANK:
Three hundred dollars an hour and that's all I get? "Put it back Frank!" I want to know why I pick it up in the first place.

---

## VIRGINIA:
You shouldn't be alone tonight, baby.

---

## PETER:
None of us should. We'll order up, James. Here we go, people! Everybody, shush!

---

## TV ANNOUNCER:
In breaking news: A Roosevelt Island cable car packed with school children plunged into the East River---.

---

## PETER:
False alarm.

---

## JAMES:
Gus, we're all starving. See what you can rustle up for us down there, will you?

---

## GUS:
Sure thing, petal.

---

## PETER:
This looks more like it.

---

## TV ANNOUNCER:
Legendary singer/actress Barbra Streisand was found…

---

## JAMES:
Something about Barbra!

---

## PETER:
Hello, Buzz. Thank God for that rave from New York 1.

---

## JAMES:
Something happened to Barbra Streisand!

---

## JULIA:
That wasn't a rave, Peter. It was "good solid theatre."

---

## JAMES:
Doesn't anybody care?

---

## PETER:
What do you want, Julia, blood?

---

## JAMES:
Have you people lost all humanity?

---

## JULIA:
Buzz promised me the moon!

---

## PETER:
What are you telling this woman, Buzz? The Times is an out and out rave?­ You 're sure? Have you actually seen it? No? The moment you get it—

---

## PETER:
Better than you anyway. Stop the presses! He's got a few quotes from The Herald. 

---

"Hats off and Hallelujah Peter Austin has written the best American play since Broken Dishes. Virginia Noyes lights up Broadway."

---

## VIRGINIA:
You bet your fucking A I do!

---

## PETER:
"Sir Frank Finger's direction is superb, taut, and just plain perfect."

---

## FRANK:
That's it?

---

## PETER:
"Peter Austin is in a small handful of promising young American Dramatists."

---

## JAMES:
That's a wonderful review, Peter.

---

## PETER:
Thanks, Buzz. How much longer before we get the Times? This is agony.

---

## PETER:
Now what?

---

## JULIA:
It sounds like a brawl.

---

## GUS:
You'd better get down there. Somebody took a poke at that Ira Drew fellow, and then everybody started hitting him.

## IRA:
Is there a bathroom in here?

---

## JULIA:
Over there, Mr. Drew. Are you all right?

---

## IRA:
Of course I'm not all right! In here, you say?

---

## JULIA:
Yes. I mean, no!

---

## FRANK:
Is that who I think it is?

---

## JULIA:
Just let him sniff you, Mr. Drew!

---

## FRANK:
What was that?

---

## JULIA:
Torch! Nooooo!

---

## IRA:
I suppose that's your dog.

---

## JULIA:
Murderer! Mur-der-er!

---

## IRA:
I didn't shoot him.

---

## JAMES:
Hey, hey! Easy, Julia.

---

## IRA:
He's perfectly all right.

---

## JULIA:
He'd better be. Let me see him!

---

## IRA:
Darling? It's the last remaining Hound of the Baskervilles.

---

## VIRGINIA:
Is that thing real?

---

## IRA:
It's loaded with blanks. I had to start carrying one after my review of Julie Andrews.

---

## FRANK:
May I?

---

## IRA:
However, I enjoyed your performance Miss Noyes. Real star quality. It's what our theatre needs. I liked your work, too, Sir Finger.

---

## FRANK:
It's Sir Frank.

---

## IRA:
But then I always do.

---

## JAMES:
What happened to you down there?

---

## IRA:
The plate of lasagna was Patti LuPone, the split lip-was the president of the Dramatists Guild.

---

## VIRGINIA:
He took a swing at you?

---

## IRA:
She took several swings at me; The next thing I knew I was on the floor and Alec Baldwin was kicking me.

---

## JULIA:
I don't understand.. He's never turned on anyone before tonight.

---

## VIRGINIA:
He smells blood -like everyone else.

---

## JULIA:
I hope this won't affect your review of Peter's play.

---

## IRA:
Critics can't afford to hold petty grudges. Besides waiting for Jesse Green and the New York Times is what tonight is all about. 

---

Who cares what a non­ entity like me thinks?

---

## JULIA:
You 're not a non-entity and you 're very well thought of.

---

## VIRGINIA:
You're also the most vicious critic in New York.

---

## IRA:
Throw that in my face.

---

## VIRGINIA:
"She reminds me of nothing so much as a female impersonator in search of a female to impersonate.”

---

## IRA:
I said that about the Baby June in the Cape May Playhouse production of Gypsy years ago. It's curious you should remember it.

---

## VIRGINIA:
I was the Baby June in the Cape May Playhouse production of Gypsy.

---

## IRA:
You changed your name?

---

## VIRGINIA:
After your review,  I changed my face. Cosmetic surgery for a 14-year old.

---

## PETER:
The stakes are so high for a new American play on Broadway, I think we're all a little over the top tonight. Hi, I'm Peter Austin.

---

## IRA:
I haven't written my review yet.

---

## PETER:
Just as I'm entitled to writing my plays, you’re entitled to your opinion of them.

---

## IRA:
Fair enough.

---

## PETER:
Fortunately for me, my parents didn't take your advice and smother me in my crib.

---

## IRA:
I'm very glad they didn't. I love the theatre; it's what people are doing to it I can't stand.

---

## PETER:
It's not on purpose, Mr Drew .

---

## IRA:
It's Ira, please.

---

## JULIA:
I'm so glad to see you two getting along.

---

## IRA:
It's the funniest thing, I like you personally.

---

## IRA:
It's just your work I can't stand.

---

## PETER:
Hear a playwright's prayer, Oh Lord. Listen to the humble plea of thy servant, Peter, descendant of Aeschylus, Shakespeare, Moliere, Ibsen and Chekhov.

---

## FRANK:
What the hell is he doing?

---

## PETER:
Bless me and my meager skills with which I've only tried to amuse, intrigue, provoke, stimulate, and move an audience 

---

while creating believable characters in true-to-life situations which somehow illuminate the human experience.

---

## JULIA:
Oh, Peter!

---

## PETER:
Bless thy humble producer-servant Julia.

---

## JULIA:
How lovely!

---

## PETER:
Bless all producers who put our plays on and keep them running, even when it means enormous financial sacrifice for their husbands and puts their children's future at risk.

---

## JULIA:
I don't care about that, Peter, you know I don't.

---

## PETER:
Bless thy humble actress servant, Virginia, who gave the performance of a

---

## JULIA:
Get down, Virginia!

---

## PETER:
Bless her unique timing, her wonderful voice. Bless her for being almost letter perfect in her part.

---

## VIRGINIA:
You try acting with a fucking ankle bracelet that goes off!

---

## PETER:
Bless thy humble director servant, Sir Frank Finger. Bless him for returning my iPad, which mysteriously vanished the second day of rehearsal. Bless him for his unbroken string of successes.

---

## JAMES:
Amen. That was beautiful. Can we go downstairs now?

---

## PETER:
Bless my friend, James, thy humble television series star-servant, who had to turn my play down and so we came up with Jack, for whom everyone says there is a definite Tony nomination, if not award. 

---

Bless Jack and his Tony nomination,- if not award. Also bless  James' series which is rumored to be going off the air.

---

## JAMES:
Where did you hear that?

---

## VIRGINIA:
New York Post, Page Six.

---

## PETER:
Bless thy humble critic-servant Ira. 

---

Bless all critics who are really failed playwrights or actors and who become critics out of desperation but who mean well and are only trying to uphold the standards of the theatre without knowing how truly hard it is to write a play. 

---

Shower them with the same mercy they deny others. And bless the theatre in which we all serve. 

---

Bless this ancient art form which is so superior to the movies and television.

---

## JULIA:
The theatre, yes!

---

## GUS:
What's going on, dudes?

---

## JULIA:
Get down, Gus!

---

## GUS:
I'm supposed to be getting Lady Gaga her coat.

---

## PETER:
Bless thy humble servant-servant .. what's your name, love?

---

## GUS:
Gus.

---

## PETER:
Gus, who is bringing Lady Gaga's coat down to her. Bless Lady Gaga.

---

## JULIA:
Amen!

---

## PETER:
Amen.

---

## ALL:
Amen.

---

## PETER:
Lord! In our hour of greatest need, give us the gift to realize that no matter what happens tonight, it's only a play... give us just one more thing. 

---

It's not much. When you consider the problems you've unleashed on the world: wars and famines and hurricanes and oil spills, surely you can give us a hit tonight. 

---

If you can't give us unanimous raves, we'll settle for the Times. The rest are negotiable. 

---

That is my prayer to you, Lord. That is every playwright's prayer.

---

## JULIA:
Amen.

---

## THE OTHERS:
Amen.

---

## PETER:
Do you hear me, Lord, may I hope for some sign?

---

## GUS:
That was quick.

---

## JULIA:
Not now, Virginia, we're all very tense.

---

## VIRGINIA:
You're tense? I've got a fucking lobster on my ankle.

---

## FRANK:
I'm keeping this in the play, Ginny.

---

## JULIA:
Quiet! All of you.

---

## JULIA:
That's it, the very special ring! It's our press agent with the review! Where is my cell phone? Frank!

---

## FRANK:
I didn't take it!

---

## VIRGINIA:
It's under the coats.

---

## PETER:
Try under the sofa cushions.

---

## JULIA:
Stop!

---

## PETER:
Don't even think about it, Torch.

---

## JAMES:
Don't be so dramatic, Peter.

---

## PETER:
Drama is my business.

---

## IRA:
You could have fooled me.

---

## PETER:
Who said that? Who the fuck said that?

---

## JULIA:
"With the opening of The Golden Egg at the Barrymore last night ... " I can't.

---

## PETER:
Virginia? Frank?

---

## GUS:
I'll read it. I'm the only objective one here.

---

## PETER:
He's right.

---

## GUS:
This is exciting. Can we do a Selfie first? Have a record of this historic moment?

---

## PETER:
Well?

---

## GUS:
I'm reading, I'm reading.

---

## PETER:
Out loud!

---

## PETER:
"With the opening of The Golden Egg at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre last night, Peter Austin makes his eagerly awaited Broadway debut. Would that he hadn't."

---

## JULIA:
Peter.

---

## PETER:
I'm okay, Julia, I'm okay.

---

## JULIA:
That sentence doesn't even make sense. What's more permanent than your lifetime?

---

## PETER:
"Even the ushers at the Barrymore should be walking with lowered heads today, and for at least another season to come. Shame, shame.''

---

## JAMES:
When they go for the ushers! That's gotta be a first.

---

## PETER:
I'm going to be sick.

---

## JULIA:
That's enough, Peter.

---

## PETER:
I began and I'll finish it.

---

## JULIA:
Any fool could see that. I did.

---

## PETER:
"With such a title, I must confess that I arrived at the playhouse with my critical hackles already up."

---

## JULIA:
He's admitting he was prejudiced.

---

## PETER:
"After ten minutes of Mr. Austin's play, they were so up the woman behind me complained she couldn't see.

---

## PETER:
You think this is easy?

---

## JULIA:
My darling Peter.

---

## FRANK:
I wish I could say I know how you feel, man.

---

## VIRGINIA:
That's it? He didn't even mention me.

---

## IRA:
"It is dismaying to remember that Mr. Austin... "

---

## JULIA:
Please, Mr. Drew!

---

## PETER:
It's all right, Julia.

---

## JULIA:
You're only tormenting yourself.

---

## PETER:
If you can't stand the heat, stay out of the kitchen.

---

## IRA:
" ... to remember that Mr. Austin was the author of Flashes, which I praised to the skies along with my colleagues with the single exception of Ira Drew, 

---

who I generally find the least perceptive and the most prejudiced of the New York critics."

---

## JAMES:
Are you going to finish that review or not?

---

## IRA:
"The plot of Mr. Austin's debacle.. ,"

---

## JAMES:
We know all that.

---

## VIRGINIA:
Get to the acting.

---

## IRA:
"I can be more cheerful about the acting."

---

## PETER:
Here you go, Ginny.

---

## IRA:
"But not much. Only Jack Nimble, as the unlucky Tamburini, a role that was clearly tailored for James Wacker... "

---

## JAMES:
Wicker!

---

## IRA:
It says Wacker.

---

## PETER:
Leave me alone, goddammit!

---

## IRA:
"Then Mr. Nimble is a shoo-in for this season's Best Actor Tony Award."

---

## JAMES:
You've got to be kidding.

---

## IRA:
"As for Mr. Wicker-." They got it right this time.

---

## JAMES:
What did I do?

---

## IRA:
"-who is chiefly remembered for his somewhat over-praised performance in Mr. Austin's Flashes--"

---

## JAMES:
For my what?

---

## JULIA:
Somewhat over-praised performance, darling.

---

## IRA:
"Certainly I preferred his replacement, Harvey Fierstein, who brought a more masculine presence and yet strangely cutting sensitivity to the role... "

---

## JAMES:
Who brought a what?

---

## JULIA:
A more masculine presence and yet a strangely cutting-

---

## JAMES:
Shut up, Julia, I heard what he said.

---

## IRA:
... Mr.Wicker should count himself lucky to be out of this turkey due to his commitments to his enormously popular television-series, Out On A Lamb."

---

## JAMES:
"Limb," damnit, "Limb."

---

## IRA:
It says "Lamb."

---

## JAMES:
Give me that!

---

## VIRGINIA:
That's funny, I thought I was the star of this thing.

---

## JAMES:
''Virginia Noyes, making a welcome return to the New York stage"

---

## PETER:
Yes!

---

## JAMES:
" ... after a tabloid-stained stint in Hollywood including.an Os.car for her controversial performance as an autistic social worker…"

---

## VIRGINIA:
She wasn't autistic.

---

## JAMES:
" ... .I personally would have preferred the award going to Hillary Swank for her work in just about anything---but I digress. Back to Miss Noyes."

---

## FRANK:
Here you go, Virginia.

---

## JAMES:
"She wears out her welcome in her very first scene."

---

## VIRGINIA:
I don't have a scene, it's three lines.

---

## JAMES:
"After that, it's downhill all the way. She reminds me of nothing so much as a female impersonator in search of a female to impersonate."

---

## IRA:
That's out and out plagiarism.

---

## JAMES:
"At one point, when she went into sort of a dance, my theatre-going companion said "My God, this is worse than genital herpes.

---

## IRA:
That’s going too far. Even I wouldn’t!

---

## JAMES:
“I hope by the time she reads this, she is headed back to Acting Rehab. Bon voyage and good riddance, Miss Noyes."

---

## VIRGINIA:
He didn't even say I was fascinating. I always get "fascinating" at least. Even when I wasn't very good, I was fascinating. 

---

Now I stink and I'm not fascinating. And people wonder why people do drugs. 

---

This is why they O-D. You're all waiting for me to. Aren't you? Guess what? I’m not. 

---

I won't give him the satisfaction. Fuck him. Yea fuck him. Just fucking fuck fuck him. Fuck him where it hurts.

---

## PETER:
That was beautifully said, Virginia.

---

## VIRGINIA:
Fucking right, it was.

---

## JULIA:
I wouldn't be an actor for anything in the world.

---

## JAMES:
“The rest of the cast is outstanding."

---

## PETER:
There's a quote, Julia!

---

## JAMES:
"Considering what these valiant troopers have been asked to perform; I'm only surprised they haven't marched on the producer's house and stoned it."

---

## JULIA:
I got off easy!

---

## JAMES:
"As for the producer, one Julia Budder, and I urge you to remember that name, Julia Budder, remember it well, Julia Budder-"

---

## JULIA:
Stop, this is inhuman!

---

## JAMES:
"With her money, Mrs. Budder should have done something worthwhile: such as open a mental hospital in which to have her head examined."

---

## JULIA:
I have opened hospitals.

---

## JAMES:
"When one thinks of the plays Mrs. Budder could have produced, instead of Mr. Austin's dreck, the mind boggles. What possessed you, Mrs. Budder?"

---

## JULIA:
What possessed any of us?

---

## JAMES:
"What possessed any of you? Have I left anyone out?"

---

## PETER:
Everyone's favorite director.

---

## JAMES:
"Oh, yes, the direction of Frank Finger."

---

## FRANK:
I've been waiting for this. It's been a long time coming. Go ahead, I'm ready.

---

## JAMES:
''Long the most brilliant of our younger directors, Sir Frank gives us another stunning production. He makes poetry on a tilted disc. The actors could have stood on it all night for this Finger-phile."

---

## PETER:
Congratulations, Sir Frank

---

## JULIA:
Bravo, darling, bravo.

---

## FRANK:
Finger-phile! Finger this! I never heard such bullshit.

---

## VIRGINIA:
You want to trade?

---

## FRANK:
Is it my looks? Do they all want to have wild sex with me and are blind to the work? Is it my personality? I can't help it: I was born charismatic.

---

## JAMES:
"I hope this review will not make you want to rush to the Barrymore Theatre. Besides; I bet they're striking the scenery this very moment. 

---

Unless, of course, it hasn't already collapsed out of sheer embarrassment. Oh well, onwards and upwards with the Arts.

---

## PETER:
I think it's important that we all love one another very, very much right now.

---

## VIRGINIA:
What was I thinking, doing a play?

---

## JAMES:
Harvey Fierstein?

---

## IRA:
Seeing you people like this, the genuine hurt. I’m sorry more critics can't share this experience with me.

---

## JULIA:
Oh, fuck off, Mr. Drew. I'm sorry, but please!

---

## GUS:
Back home, you write something like that about people, you 're gonna get your ass whupped. 

---

I'll be happy to stomp that pecker's butt good for him, Mrs. Budder, just say the word.

---

## JULIA:
Thank you, Gus, it's a lovely thought but we don't do things like that in the theatre.

---

## PETER:
We don't do anything. We pretend nothing happened. And then we suck up to the same people all over again.

---

## VIRGINIA:
Popular Mechanics just came in. They loved us. We got two hammers and a screw.

---

## JAMES:
Harvey Fierstein?

---

## PETER:
When you think about it, there’s no way he could have liked this play.

---

## JULIA:
There isn't?

---

## PETER:
But that's okay. I can think of lots of shows that made it without a good review from the Times.

---

## GUS:
You can, honey?

---

## PETER:
Who is this person?

---

## JAMES:
Jim Lichtscheidl I could accept but Harvey Fierstein?

---

## FRANK:
This play threatens a lot of people, Peter. They don't want to see themselves as they are.

---

## VIRGINIA:
You'd have to be a psychotic, narcissistic, masochistic idiot to be an actor.

---

## IRA:
But seriously, weren't you aware something like this might happen? Didn't your preview audiences ... ?

---

## VIRGINIA:
We had two and a half weeks of senior citizens -- all on freebies and headsets. "What did she say?" "Huh?'' "What did she say?" "What did who say?" "That actress who used to be good."

---

## JULIA:
Don't be bitter, Virginia. It doesn't become you.

---

## GUS:
Are you a straight-play or a comedy?

---

## PETER:
We're a comedy with serious overtones.

---

## GUS:
You mean like Moliere or more like Neil Simon?

---

## PETER:
I mean like me.

---

## JULIA:
You'd better see about the party, Gus.

---

## GUS:
I'm sorry, Mrs. Budder, I was just trying to help.

---

## JAMES:
And bring some food up with you!

---

## PETER:
What about our word of mouth?

---

## VIRGINIA:
We've got hoof and mouth!

---

## JULIA:
Virginia! I hate pessimism.

---

## FRANK:
Are you okay, Ginny?

---

## VIRGINIA:
For someone who wore out her welcome in her first scene, I'm great.

---

## FRANK:
You're a wonderful actress.

---

## VIRGINIA:
I couldn't even book an A.A. meeting in L.A. I was in a supermarket on Santa Monica, looking at myself on the cover of one of the rags - “Virginia Noyes: Trading Oscar for Drugs?" - which is so not true - when I saw the announcement for your play, Peter.

---

## FRANK:
We couldn't believe it when we heard you were coming in to read for us.

---

## VIRGINIA:
This play was going to turn everything around for me. I didn't know someone sitting out there thought otherwise. I'm going down there and look every one of those mother-fuckers in the face. I'm an actress, a damn good one.

---

## FRANK:
Ask me if I'd cast her again-in a second. Virginia!

---

## PETER:
Just remember your promise to me, Julia. One good quote, you said, you'll put up a fight for this show.

---

## JULIA:
One good quote, Peter, and I'll put up the biggest fight anybody ever saw. 

---

Like that wonderful song says, if I can make it here, I can make it there.

---

## PETER:
You might be needing that blimp yet.

---

## IRA:
What blimp?

---

## JULIA:
Our press agent hired the Goodyear blimp with quotes for the play.

---

## IRA:
What's he going to quote?

---

## GUS:
I brought the Times up.

---

## JAMES:
I’ll take one of those.

---

## JAMES:
What do you know! The Phantom of the Opera is closing.

---

## GUS:
No fair! I haven't seen it yet.

---

## JAMES:
You better hurry. "Positively last ten years" it says.

---

## PETER:
There's still hope, Julia. I had a Mass said for the critics. I sent them each a Mass card.

---

## IRA:
A Mass card?

---

## JAMES:
"ABC Announces Four Cancellations; Out On A Limb Among Them."

---

## PETER:
That's terrible, Jimmy, just terrible.

---

## JAMES:
We never had a chance.

---

## PETER:
You had nine years with it.

---

## JAMES:
Not with our writers.

---

## PETER:
You never have to work again.

---

## JAMES:
Not in our time slot.

---

## PETER:
You can do theatre now.

---

## JAMES:
There are other things in the world besides your play.

---

## PETER:
Not tonight there are not.

---

## JAMES:
Hello, ABC? I want to protest the cancellation of --

---

## PETER:
You're not going to make my opening about you. I need that phone.

---

## JAMES:
You could stuff an elephant with the egos in this room.

---

## PETER:
Do they know the financial sacrifices I made to write this play? Pilots, movies of the week. A mini-series on the life of Anthony Wiener.

---

## JAMES:
What are you doing?

---

## PETER:
I just read your review of the new Peter Austin play and I think you're a pretentious, British-ass-kissing twat and no one likes you.

---

## JAMES:
Who was that?

---

## PETER:
Jesse Green.

---

## JAMES:
Jesse Green?

---

## PETER:
You see what this business is driving me to?

---

## JAMES:
Jesse Green?? How did you get his number?

---

## PETER:
I know all the critics' numbers.

---

## JAMES:
You listen to me. You call him right back and tell him that wasn't me. Dial. Dial!

---

## PETER:
Where's your famous sense of humor?

---

## JAMES:
Thank you, Peter, now give me that.

---

## JULIA:
Shame on you both.

---

## IRA:
Mrs. Budder, about Bluestocking....

---

## JULIA:
Not now, Mr. Drew.

---

## JAMES:
Grow up, Peter, face facts. Your play is a flop.

---

## PETER:
You've been waiting to use the F word all evening.

---

## JAMES:
That's not true.

---

## PETER:
You're frothing at the mouth. There's foam on your lips.

---

## JAMES:
This is ridiculous.

---

## PETER:
Say it again, say flop.

---

## JAMES:
I don't have to.

---

## PETER:
What does that mean?

---

## JAMES:
A lot of other people are saying it for me.

---

## PETER:
Who? Name one.

---

## JAMES:
Jesse Green for openers.

---

## PETER:
Flop, if that isn't the ugliest word in the English language, I'd like to know what is.

---

## JAMES:
How about wishing someone and his fucking series a sudden and violent death?

---

## PETER:
It would be the best thing that ever happened to you.

---

## JAMES:
I'll be the judge of that.

---

## PETER:
You can do theatre again.

---

## JAMES:
You've turned into a theatre snob.

---

## PETER:
Proud of it! To see your best friend, a great actor, making a fool of himself week after week, year after year…!

---

## JAMES:
I knew you never liked my series.

---

## PETER:
After the pilot, I never watched it.

---

## JAMES:
I wish I could say the same thing about your play.

---

## PETER:
You told me you loved it.

---

## PETER:
To think I made you a star!

---

## JAMES:
Made me a what?

---

## PETER:
You were on a streetcar named oblivion before my play.

---

## JAMES:
Funny, the first thing people talk about is my performance.

---

## PETER:
I think you should revive it and salvage what's left of your reputation.

---

## JULIA:
Grown men!

---

## JAMES:
Revive it with someone with a more masculine presence who cuts deeper.

---

## PETER:
You know something? Harvey did.

---

## JAMES:
Funny how it closed three weeks after I left and Harvey went in.

---

## PETER:
It wasn't Harvey's fault, there was a big strike on at the time.

---

## JAMES:
UPS, for Christ’s sake. Next thing you'll be telling us is this one failed because it opened on Flag Day. You wrote a turkey, Peter. A big fat turkey. Gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble.

---

## PETER:
This is a wrap for our friendship.

---

## JAMES:
Total.

---

## PETER:
It should have happened five years ago.

---

## JAMES:
Ten.

---

## JULIA:
I'd rather not have produced this play than to see this.

---

## PETER:
Buzz?

---

## JULIA:
If I had a best friend, I'd treasure him.

---

## PETER:
It's the Shuberts, those vultures. Close this play, Julia--!

---

## JULIA:
Who said anything about closing?

---

## PETER:
It's crossed your mind, don't deny it.

---

## JULIA:
Well of course it has.

---

## PETER:
That's my Julia.

---

## JULIA:
That's a little more like it. Listen, darling, whoever you are, we're in an absolute state of shock about the Times but I haven't thrown in the towel. 

---

I'm a fighter. I’d like to find a way to lower our weekly operating costs. Do we need all those stagehands? 

---

Our set doesn't move. We don't even have a curtain to raise and lower. I know that's a good question: I thought you might be able to answer it. 

---

And what about those men playing poker in the basement? I know they're musicians – but we're not a musical.

---

## JULIA:
Well, if your hands are tied, what about mine?...I see... .I see... I see. Of course I don't want that on my conscience.

---

## PETER:
I'd hate to be in your shoes tonight, Julia.

---

## JULIA:
They're your shoes, too, Peter, they're everyone's.

---

## VIRGINIA:
Are we gonna run?

---

## PETER:
We're still waiting for the rest of the reviews.

---

## GUS:
The cast of The Iceman Cometh just got here. It's a very long play.

---

## PETER:
This'll be Buzz.

---

## JULIA:
All we need is one strong quote and I'll run this play forever.

---

## GUS:
Hello?

---

## JULIA:
James?

---

## PETER:
The moment he's been waiting for, Julia.

---

## JAMES:
That's not true, Peter.

---

## JULIA:
He doesn't mean that, James.

---

## JAMES:
Buzz, Jimmy Wicker... Thank you, I'm sorry, too. It was a good ride while it lasted. Listen, I hope you've got some good news for us.
---
Okay, fuck the Times. Let's go.

---

## GUS:
I take shorthand…?

---

## JAMES:
The Daily News "In the final analysis, Mr. Austin's new play falls just short enough of the mark to fail utterly, however honorably.”

---

## PETER:
I love you, too.

---

## JAMES:
If and when the great American play is written, Peter Austin could be its author, but not with this one."

---

## FRANK:
You hear that, mate?

---

## VIRGINIA:
A review like that would keep me going for at least the rest of my life.

---

## JAMES:
"Virginia Noyes is a luminescent actress. She brings a touching dignity and emotional honesty to the role that is a huge step forward from her screen persona. Welcome back to the theatre, Miss Noyes."

---

## VIRGINIA:
That sounds good.

---

## FRANK:
It's bloody brilliant.

---

## JAMES:
"Sir Frank Finger's direction ... "

---

## FRANK:
Don't even bother.

---

## JAMES:
" ... escapes me, the play and the production."

---

## FRANK:
You want to repeat that?

---

## JAMES:
''Long the most over-rated talent I know, Mr. Finger is one emperor who isn't wearing any clothes. We fought a Revolution to rid ourselves of assholes like him." The New York Post.

---

## JULIA:
Congratulations, Sir Frank, bravo.

---

## FRANK:
Thanks.

---

## PETER:
I'm very happy for you, Frank.

---

## VIRGINIA:
Are you okay?

---

## FRANK:
I'm fine. I feel good. Really, really good. Thank you New York Post. I finally got what I wanted.
---
I hate it. Who does he think he is anyway? My father? ''Good boy! Bad boy! Go play some rugby with your mates, 'stead of playing with bleeding puppets."
---
"But I love me puppets, Daddy." "I'll show you what I think of your little toy theatre."

---

## JULIA:
My gym membership.

---

## IRA:
My gun.

---

## VIRGINIA:
My Quaaludes.

---

## JAMES:
A meatball hero.

---

## PETER:
Rest, rest perturbed spirit.

---

## FRANK:
Thank you, mate.

---

## PETER:
What about the weeklies?

---

## JAMES:
Time magazine doesn't review shows that already closed.

---

## PETER:
We haven't closed!

---

## JAMES:
Time Out left after the first act. New York left during the first act.

---

## PETER:
Get the New Yorker. They've always been good to me.

---

## JAMES:
They're coming the second night, if there is one.

---

## JULIA:
Tell him I'm very disappointed in his services..

---

## JAMES:
He just told me he quit.

---

## GUS:
For what it's worth: in the out-of-town tryout, the original Harvey was a giraffe.

---

## JULIA:
I can't deal with a remark like that.

---

## GUS:
Changing him to an invisible rabbit happened walking across the Boston Common after a Saturday matinee.

---

## JULIA:
No more theatre lore, Gus, please. I want you to go downstairs and ask everyone to leave. Tell them the party's over.

---

## GUS:
You heard Mr. Green: onwards and upwards.

---

## PETER:
I'll tell you one thing, Mr. Drew. God punishes people who do plays on Broadway. He punishes them good.

---

## IRA:
That's why he invented regional theatre.

---

## PETER:
New York is my regional theatre. It's the only one I have. I don't know what people want in a play anymore.
---
I mean, besides 90 minutes with no intermission and someone they've been told is a star?

---

## JULIA:
Life - lots and lots of life. We want to laugh. We want to cry. We want to feel something about who we are. Take us somewhere. We'll go with you.
---
It doesn't have to be a masterpiece.

---

## PETER:
You make it sound easy.

---

## JAMES:
When I'd get discouraged, my father used to say "It's only a play, Jimbo, it's only a play." Only he said it in Italian. "E' solo una commedia, Jimbo, e' solo una commedia."

---

## JULIA:
Elliot always says, "It's your money, honey. You sure you want to throw it away like this?"

---

## GUS:
It's breaking up down there. Everybody's real disappointed. The cast was wondering if there's going to be a second night.

---

## PETER:
What'd be the point?

---

## GUS:
They said to thank you for being the nicest producer they've ever worked with. And they want to wish you a merry Christmas.

---

## PETER:
No more calls.

---

## GUS:
Hello?

---

## PETER:
Who is it?

---

## JULIA:
It's all my fault. That turntable did matter. I'll never forgive myself.

---

## VIRGINIA:
It's all my fault. Everybody was staring at the goddamn ankle bracelet and then, when it went off!

---

## JAMES:
You're right, Peter, it's my fault Your play never had a chance without me.

---

## FRANK:
It's my fault. I wanted to fail and I brought you and your play down instead!

---

## PETER:
It's all my fault. I wrote it.

---

## JULIA:
Torch!

---

template: noise
GUS (Singing) So if you care to find me, Look to the western sky. As someone told me lately, "Everyone deserves the chance to fly." And if I'm flying solo, At least I'm flying free. To those who'd ground me, Take a message back from me. Tell them how I am defying gravity. I'm flying high, defying gravity, And soon I'll match them in renown. And nobody in all of Oz, No Wizard that there is or was, Is ever gonna bring me down. (I hope you're happy) Bring me down!

---

## JULIA:
Thank you, Gus. That's the spirit. Here's to your next one, Peter.

---

## PETER:
After tonight, who'd want to produce it?

---

## JULIA:
I certainly would. Why do you think I produced this one?

---

## PETER:
A tax loss?

---

## JULIA:
Peter!

---

## PETER:
You really liked it?

---

## JULIA:
And I thought a lot of other people would, too. Of course there were things wrong with your play. I wish I could have helped you fix them,
---
but the sight of Virginia in her big speech: the way that Sir Frank had her standing, her hair, the costume, the lighting, your beautiful words... you could hear a pin drop.

---

## VIRGINIA:
"I would dream of Persia and flying carpets and every far-off place I'd ever read of. I could dream of them under my quilt with the calico patches,"

---

## PETER:
That was perfect, Virginia, just perfect! Thank you.

---

## GUS:
Sounds like I missed something,

---

## JULIA:
You did, Gus. And I produced it. Anyone can come up with a tax loss. It takes a very special maniac to produce a play.

---

## IRA:
I don't understand you people. One minute you're at each other's throats, the next you're going to do another play together.

---

## JAMES:
It's called theatre. What is it you don't understand?-

---

## IRA:
I'm in the theatre, too, you know.

---

## VIRGINIA:
On the outside looking in.

---

## IRA:
I can't live with it anymore! I've got to tell someone. I am Caroline Comstock.

---

## ALL:
Who?

---

## IRA:
The author of Bluestocking. Caroline Comstock is my nom de plume. I didn't want to unduly influence anyone because of my position as a critic. I've written 38 plays. That's two more than Shakespeare, 33 more than chekhov. I won't call Bluestocking another King Lear but it's no Riverdance 11 either. It's the best American play in years. On top of everything else, it only has one set and two characters.

---

## JULIA:
You already mentioned that.

---

## PETER:
They all want to be playwrights.

---

## GUS:
I'd better get the rest of these coats downstairs.

---

## PETER:
Bar Centrale, everybody. Or Joe Allen, if we can't get in. Come on, everyone, it's on me. You, too, Mr. Drew, what the hell. Ginny?

---

## VIRGINIA:
You wrote Bluestocking for Meryl What's-Her-Face, I suppose?

---

## VIRGINIA:
Cubby.

---

## IRA:
Cubby Blunt. She's sort of an Everywoman figure. Down to earth, basic, warm, very vital.

---

## FRANK:
Your play could be done on Peter's disc, you say?

---

## IRA:
With only the slightest of modifications.

---

## JULIA:
The load out/load in costs are exorbitant but they couldn't charge either one; we're already there.

---

## PETER:
Ginny? Frank? Julia? Let's go. James?

---

## JAMES:
Talk to me about the man's role.

---

## IRA:
His name is Fred Brown.

---

## JAMES:
Fred Brown?

---

## IRA:
But that could be changed, along with the title.

---

## JULIA:
Clap of Doom! I've always wanted to produce something called Clap of Doom.

---

## JAMES:
I like Fred Brown. It's strong, nothing wishy-washy.

---

## IRA:
Fred is down to earth, great humor, lots of warmth.

---

## JAMES:
Virile?

---

## IRA:
Extremely.

---

## JULIA:
Elliot will like that. He's bullshit in that department. What do you think, Frank?

---

## VIRGINIA:
He's working. Don't go near him.

---

## FRANK:
Okay, I've got a concept. It's something that's never been attempted before and it scares the shit out of me. Are you ready to be frightened? Check this out for kamikaze theatre. Two actors on a bare disc. Somebody enters...

---

## GUS:
That's about it down there.

---

## FRANK:
... and puts a script in their hands .

---

## VIRGINIA:
You know me and lines, Frank.

---

## FRANK:
I don't like my actors getting stale.

---

## JAMES:
I don't get stale, I ripen.

---

## VIRGINIA:
I buy it.

---

## JAMES:
I love it.

---

## JULIA:
It's brilliant, Sir Frank.

---

## IRA:
But that's exactly the idea behind Bluestocking. The play is set in a rehearsal situation. The actors are meant to be carrying their scripts. It's part of my concept.

---

## FRANK:
Your concept? Who's directing this play? We need more scripts.

---

## IRA:
They're right downstairs.

---

## JULIA:
Tell the rest of the staff, Gus, we're not to be disturbed.

---

## GUS:
Okay, but that's it, darling. I'm in rehearsal.

---

## PETER:
What do you think you're doing, Julia?

---

## JULIA:
All I'm thinking, Peter, is that, with Bluestocking, Virginia, Frank and now James will be right back to work, Gus will get to Broadway, and the Ethel Barrymore will be blazing with a new American play instead of those dreadful dancing Irish people.

---

## PETER:
You'll be the laughing stock of Broadway.

---

## JULIA:
After tonight, I already am.

---

## VIRGINIA:
The sooner you get back up on that high wire, Peter, the better.

---

## PETER:
Et tu, Brute?

---

## JAMES:
You can't write every play.

---

## PETER:
No, but I can want to.

---

## JULIA:
Start writing your next play.

---

## PETER:
Plays don't pop us like toast.

---

## JULIA:
This time I think you should write a love story.

---

## PETER:
This one was a love story, only nobody noticed.

---

## IRA:
Sorry I took so long.

---

## GUS:
They've all gone down there.

---

## JAMES:
It's been so long, I hope I haven't forgotten how to do this.

---

## PETER:
I thought you all loved me.

---

## FRANK:
Bluestocking, a new play by Caroline Comstock.

---

## IRA:
Do you know how long I've waited to bear those words?

---

## FRANK:
"At rise: nothing."

---

## JAMES:
We'll see about that.

---

## FRANK:
"Ten seconds of this. The lights come up on a green chair. It is empty. A woman screams in the distance."

---

## GUS:
Me?

---

## FRANK:
No, Julia.

---

## IRA:
This is exciting.

---

## FRANK:
What do all these dots mean?

---

## IRA:
Hesitations, pauses.

---

## FRANK:
I don't do dots.

---

## JAMES:
Neither do I.

---

## VIRGINIA:
Me either.

---

## GUS:
Pinter uses dots.

---

## FRANK:
Fuck Pinter.

---

## GUS:
Heartbreak House.

---

## JULIA:
I don't know what I want to do anymore.

---

## PETER:
When I saw our marquee go dark tonight, I thought it's important those lights keep burning. New York without the theatre is Newark.

---

## JULIA:
Peter?

---

## PETER:
You want some life? Lots and lots of life? Okay, how's this? "Julia Budder presents James Wicker and Virginia Noyes in It's Only A Play by Peter Austin featuring Gus. Entire production conceived and directed by Sir Frank Finger.”

---

## JULIA:
That's a marquee, we need a play.

---

## PETER:
I'll give you your play. I've been writing it my whole life. We lived it. We all have. It's about a leading man who's forgotten how good he can be and a best friend who makes me the best writer I can be. It's about an actress who is her own natural high, who can make the largest theatre a room in which you can hear a pin drop because everyone's stopped breathing. It's about a producer who trusts us to give her the best we can and who can raise money and not give us too many notes because of it. It's about a director who's smart enough to keep us all on the same page and will maybe lead us to glory and return my iPhone.

---

## FRANK:
Here.

---

## PETER:
Thank you. Everything I need or want is in this room. Even you, Mr. Drew.

---

## JULIA:
I'm staying put, Mr Shubert, or whatever the hell your name is. The Barrymore is not available. Budder's back in business.

---

## IRA:
What happened to my play?

---

## GUS:
The second act needs work.

---

## IRA:
How do you know?

---

## JAMES:
He's right. I flipped ahead

---

## GUS:
Every second act needs work. That's the first thing they taught us.

---

## JULIA:
Sorry to get your hopes up, Mr. Drew.

---

## PETER:
All right: "We are in the bedroom of a townhouse on Manhattan's Upper East Side, but on a disc. Downstairs an opening night party is in progress. We hear laughter and music wafting up the stairs.''

---

## GUS:
"Wafting!" I can do wafting

---

## PETER:
"A young man enters carrying coats. He is moony-eyed and star struck, like every one of us at our first opening night party.''

---

## GUS:
I can do that.

---

## JULIA:
You 're so young to be so talented.

---

## GUS:
Thank you, ma'am.

---

## PETER:
"A dapper, funny, big-hearted beloved star of the theatre enters. He is handsome and flush in his designer tuxedo. The audience applauds wildly."

---

## JAMES:
No one writes for me like you, Peter. Is this my first monologue?

---

## PETER:
"With him is a sexy, sophisticated, fascinating woman. There is a standing ovation at her entrance."

---

## VIRGINIA:
This is so much better already, Peter.

---

## PETER:
"A dog barks stage left"

---

## PETER:
All right, Torch, stage right, have it your way!

---

## FRANK:
No dog.

---

## PETER:
There has to be a dog.

---

## FRANK:
I won't work with animals, children or Sally Wingert .

---

## JULIA:
He's right, people love dogs, darling. I'm not sure about Sally Wingert.

---

## IRA:
A play about an opening night party! Theatre people! Sally Wingert! Who cares about them?

---

## JULIA:
I do.

---

## IRA:
Well of course you do. I'm talking about the audience.

---

## PETER:
They can decide for themselves.

---

## IRA:
That's my job!

---

## PETER:
At rise... and if those aren't the two most exciting words in the English language, I'd like to know what are.

---

## IRA:
Sentimental Claptrap.

---

## PETER:
The house has gone to dark....

---

## JULIA:
I'm ... what's the word? Somebody Jewish help me.. I'm kerplunkt.

---

## PETER:
... the actors are in place....

---

## VIRGINIA:
You'll get used to it.

---

## PETER:
....all is in readiness...

---

## JULIA:
This is when I look at the audience and wonder where do all these people come from?

---

## PETER:
How do you like it so far, Jimmy?

---

## JAMES:
Wonderful, just wonderful.

---

## PETER:
Cue lights.

---

## FRANK:
Go.

---

## PETER:
And curtain!
