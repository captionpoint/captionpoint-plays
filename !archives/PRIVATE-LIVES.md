## MARKIE:

A few quick housekeeping things,

---

## MARKIE:

This is a great moment to turn off your cell phones or anything else that makes noise, it can be very distracting to our performers.

## MARKIE:

We at Raven want people to react to our plays. If something up here makes you laugh, please laugh!

## MARKIE:

If something makes you cry, cry! Our actors love it , they feed off it, please have whatever reaction feels authentic to you.

---

## MARKIE:

How many people here are subscribers?

---

## MARKIE:

Thank you so much!

you can upgrade the cost of your ticket to a subscription and see the rest of our shows this season at a discount.

---

And finally, we are a not-for-profit theatre, which means everything you see up here is only possible through donations from folks like you.

---

## MARKIE:

We’re actually in a campaign right now to replace the very seats you’re sitting in, there’s more info about that in your program.

---

## MARKIE:

[MUSIC]

## LOUISE:

Bonsoir. Voila la terrasse d'un hôtel en France.

---

## LOUISE:

Il y a deux portes-fenêtres en bas, qui ouvrent a deux suites.

---

## LOUISE:

La terrasse est divisée par une ligne de petits arbres, et au bord de la scene il y a une balustrade basse en pierre.

---

## LOUISE:

De chaque côté des arbres se trouve des meubles bien choisi pour une terrasse: deux chaises et une table.

---

## LOUISE:

C'est l'été, environ huit heures du soir. Tout pres, un orchestre joue.

---

## LOUISE:

Sibyl Chase entre et sort sur la terrasse.

---

## LOUISE:

Elle est très jolie et porte de vêtements de voyage tres chic.

---

## LOUISE:

Elle traverse la scène, étend ses bras avec un petit soupir de satisfaction.

---

## SIBYL:

Elyot!

---

## SIBYL:

Elyot dear, do come out. It’s so lovely.

---

## ELYOT:

Just a minute.

---

## LOUISE:

Elle regarde la vue avec une expression extatique.

---

## ELYOT:

Not bad.

---

## SIBYL:

It’s heavenly.

---

## SIBYL:

Look at the lights of that yacht reflected in the water.

---

## SIBYL:

Oh dear, I’m so happy.

---

## ELYOT:

Are you?

---

## SIBYL:

Aren’t you?

---

## ELYOT:

Of course I am. Tremendously happy.

---

## SIBYL:

Just to think:

---

## SIBYL:

here we are,

---

## SIBYL:

you and I, married!

---

## ELYOT:

Yes, things have come to a pretty pass.

---

## SIBYL:

Don’t laugh at me.

---

## SIBYL:

You mustn’t be blasé about honeymoons just because this is your second.

---

## ELYOT:

That’s silly.

---

## SIBYL:

Have I annoyed you by saying that?

---

## ELYOT:

Just a little.

---

## SIBYL:

Oh, darling, I’m so sorry. Kiss me.

---

## ELYOT:

There.

---

## SIBYL:

Ummm, not so very enthusiastic.

---

## ELYOT:

That better?

---

## SIBYL:

Three times, please, I’m superstitious.

---

## ELYOT:

You really are very sweet.

---

## SIBYL:

Are you glad you married me?

---

## ELYOT:

Of course I am.

---

## SIBYL:

How glad?

---

## ELYOT:

Incredibly, magnificently glad.

---

## SIBYL:

How lovely.

---

## ELYOT:

We ought to go in and dress.

---

## SIBYL:

Gladder than before?

---

## ELYOT:

Why do you keep harping on that?

---

## SIBYL:

It’s in my mind, and yours too, I expect.

---

## ELYOT:

It isn’t anything of the sort.

---

## SIBYL:

She was pretty, wasn’t she?

---

## SIBYL:

Amanda?

---

## ELYOT:

Very.

---

## SIBYL:

Prettier than I am?

---

## ELYOT:

Much.

---

## SIBYL:

Elyot!

---

## ELYOT:

She was pretty and sleek

---

## ELYOT:

and her hands were long and slim

---

## ELYOT:

and her legs were long and slim

---

## ELYOT:

and she danced like an angel.

---

## ELYOT:

You dance very poorly, by the way.

---

## SIBYL:

Could she play the piano as well as I can?

---

## ELYOT:

She couldn’t play the piano at all.

---

## SIBYL:

Aha! Had she my talent for organization?

---

## ELYOT:

No, but she hadn’t your mother either.

---

## SIBYL:

Elli! I don’t believe you like Mother.

---

## ELYOT:

Like her! I can’t bear her.

---

## SIBYL:

Elyot! She’s a darling, underneath.

---

## ELYOT:

I never got underneath.

---

## SIBYL:

It makes me unhappy to think you don’t like Mother.

---

## ELYOT:

Nonsense.

---

## ELYOT:

I believe the only reason you married me was to get away from her.

---

## SIBYL:

I married you because I loved you.

---

## ELYOT:

Oh dear

---

## ELYOT:

Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear!

---

## SIBYL:

I love you far more than Amanda loved you.

---

## SIBYL:

I’d never make you miserable like she did.

---

## ELYOT:

We made each other miserable.

---

## SIBYL:

It was all her fault, you know it was.

---

## ELYOT:

Yes, it was. Entirely her fault.

---

## SIBYL:

She was a fool to lose you.

---

## ELYOT:

We lost each other.

---

## SIBYL:

She lost you, with her violent tempers and carryings on.

---

## ELYOT:

Why do you keep talking about Amanda?

---

## SIBYL:

But I’m very glad

---

## SIBYL:

because if she hadn’t been uncontrolled

---

## SIBYL:

and wicked and unfaithful

---

## SIBYL:

we wouldn’t be here now.

---

## ELYOT:

She wasn’t unfaithful.

---

## SIBYL:

How do you know? I bet she was.

---

## SIBYL:

I bet she was unfaithful every five minutes.

---

## ELYOT:

It would take a far more concentrated woman than Amanda

---

## ELYOT:

to be unfaithful every five minutes.

---

## SIBYL:

You do hate her, don’t you?

---

## ELYOT:

No, I don’t hate her.

---

## ELYOT:

I think I despise her.

---

## SIBYL:

That’s much worse.

---

## ELYOT:

And yet I’m sorry for her.

---

## SIBYL:

Why?

---

## ELYOT:

Because she’s marked for tragedy

---

## ELYOT:

she’s bound to make a mess of everything.

---

## SIBYL:

If it’s her fault, I don’t see that it matters much.

---

## ELYOT:

She has some good qualities.

---

## SIBYL:

Considering what a hell she made of your life,

---

## SIBYL:

you're very nice about her.

---

## SIBYL:

Most men would be vindictive.

---

## ELYOT:

What’s the use of that?

---

## ELYOT:

It’s all over now, such a long time ago.

---

## SIBYL:

Five years isn’t very long.

---

## ELYOT:

Yes it is.

---

## SIBYL:

Could you ever love her again?

---

## ELYOT:

Now then, Sibyl.

---

## SIBYL:

But could you?

---

## ELYOT:

Of course not, I love you.

---

## SIBYL:

Yes, but you love me differently;

---

## SIBYL:

I know that.

---

## ELYOT:

More wisely perhaps.

---

## SIBYL:

I’m glad.

---

## SIBYL:

I’d rather have that sort of love.

---

## ELYOT:

You’re right.

---

## ELYOT:

Love is no use unless it’s kind, and wise,
and undramatic.

---

## ELYOT:

Something steady and sweet, to smooth out your nerves when you’re tired.

---

## ELYOT:

Something tremendously cozy;

---

## ELYOT:

and unflurried by scenes and jealousies.

---

## ELYOT:

That’s what I want,

---

## ELYOT:

What I’ve always wanted really.

---

## ELYOT:

Oh my dear, I do hope it won't be dull for you.

---

## SIBYL:

Sweetheart, as though you could ever be dull.

---

## ELYOT:

I’m much older than you.

---

## SIBYL:

Not so very much.

---

## ELYOT:

Seven years.

---

[Ocean waves]

---

## SIBYL:

The music has stopped and you can hear the sea.

---

## ELYOT:

You’re a completely feminine little creature,
aren’t you?

---

## SIBYL:

Why do you say that?

---

## ELYOT:

Everything in its place.

---

## SIBYL:

What do you mean?

---

## ELYOT:

If you’d like me to smoke a pipe,

---

## ELYOT:

I’ll try and master it.

---

## SIBYL:

I like a man to be a man, if that’s what you mean.

---

## ELYOT:

Are you going to understand me, and manage me?

---

## SIBYL:

I’m going to try to understand you.

---

## ELYOT:

Run me without my knowing it?

---

## SIBYL:

I think you’re being a little unkind.

---

## ELYOT:

No, I don’t mean to be. I was only wondering.

---

## SIBYL:

Well?

---

## ELYOT:

I was wondering what was going inside your mind, what your plans are really?

---

## SIBYL:

Plans; Oh, Elli!

---

## ELYOT:

Apart from loving me and all that,

---

## ELYOT:

you must have plans.

---

## SIBYL:

I haven’t the faintest idea what you’re talking about.

---

## ELYOT:

Perhaps its subconscious then,

---

## ELYOT:

age old instincts working away deep down,

---

## ELYOT:

mincing up little bits of experience for future use,

---

## ELYOT:

watching me like a little sharp-eyed kitten.

---

## SIBYL:

How can you be so horrid.

---

## ELYOT:

I said Kitten, not Cat.

---

## SIBYL:

Kittens grown into cats.

---

## ELYOT:

Let that be a warning to you.

---

## SIBYL:

What’s the matter, darling,

---

## SIBYL:

are you hungry?

---

## ELYOT:

Not a bit.

---

## SIBYL:

You’re very strange all of a sudden,

---

## SIBYL:

and rather cruel.

---

## SIBYL:

Just because I’m feminine doesn’t mean that I’m crafty and calculating.

---

## ELYOT:

I didn’t say you were either of those things.

---

## SIBYL:

I hate these half-masculine women who go banging about.

---

## ELYOT:

I hate anybody who goes banging about.

---

## SIBYL:

I should think you needed a little quiet womanliness after Amanda.

---

## ELYOT:

Why will you keep talking about her?

---

## SIBYL:

It’s natural enough isn’t it?

---

## ELYOT:

What do you want to find out?

---

## SIBYL:

Why did you really let her divorce you?

---

## ELYOT:

She divorced me for cruelty, and flagrant infidelity.

---

## ELYOT:

I spent a whole weekend in Brighton with a woman named Vera Williams.

---

## ELYOT:

She had the nastiest-looking hairbrush I have ever seen.

---

## SIBYL:

Misplaced chivalry, I call it.

---

## SIBYL:

Why didn’t you divorce her?

---

## ELYOT:

It would not have been the action of a gentleman,

---

## ELYOT:

whatever that may mean.

---

## SIBYL:

I think she got off very lightly.

---

## ELYOT:

Once and for all will you stop talking about Amanda?

---

## SIBYL:

Yes, darling.

---

## ELYOT:

I don’t wish to see her again or hear her name mentioned.

---

## SIBYL:

Very well, darling.

---

## ELYOT:
Is that understood?
--

## SIBYL:

Yes, darling. Where did you spend your honeymoon?

---

## ELYOT:

St. Moritz. Be quiet.
--

## SIBYL:

I hate St. Moritz.

---

## ELYOT:

So do I, bitterly.

---

## SIBYL:

Was she good on skis?

---

## ELYOT:

Shall we dine downstairs here,

---

## ELYOT:

or at the Casino?

---

## SIBYL:

I love you

---

## SIBYL:

I love you, I love you.

---

## ELYOT:

Good, now let’s go in and dress.

---

## SIBYL:

Kiss me first.

---

## ELYOT:

Casino?

---

## SIBYL:

Yes.

---

## ELYOT:

Are you a gambler? You never told me.

---

## ELYOT:

Every now and then.

---

## SIBYL:

I shall come and sit just behind your chair and bring you luck.

---

## ELYOT:

That will be fatal.

---

---

## VICTOR:

Mandy.

---

## AMANDA:

What?

---

## VICTOR:

Come outside, the view is wonderful.

---

## AMANDA:

Wait a minute

---

## AMANDA:

I’m still damp from the bath.

---

## AMANDA:

I shall catch pneumonia, that’s what I shall catch.

---

## VICTOR:

God!

---

## AMANDA:

I beg your pardon?

---

## VICTOR:

You look wonderful.

---

## AMANDA:

Thank you, darling.

---

## VICTOR:

Like a beautiful advertisement for

---

## VICTOR:

something.

---

## AMANDA:

Nothing peculiar, I hope.

---

## VICTOR:

I can hardly believe it’s true.

---

## VICTOR:

You and I, here alone together, married!

---

## AMANDA:

That stuff’s very rough.

---

## VICTOR:

Don't you like it?

---

## AMANDA:

A bit hearty, isn’t it?

---

## VICTOR:

Do you love me?

---

## AMANDA:

Of course, that’s why I’m here.

---

## VICTOR:

More than -

---

## AMANDA:

Now then, none of that.

---

## VICTOR:

No,

---

## VICTOR:

but do you love me more than you loved Elyot?

---

## AMANDA:

I don’t remember, it’s such a long time ago.

---

## VICTOR:

Not so very long.

---

## AMANDA:

All my life ago.

---

## VICTOR:

I'd like to break his damned neck.

---

## AMANDA:

Why?

---

## VICTOR:

For making you unhappy.

---

## AMANDA:

It was mutual.

---

## VICTOR:

Rubbish! It was all his fault, you know it was.

---

## AMANDA:

Yes, it was, now I come to think about it.

---

## VICTOR:

Swine!

---

## AMANDA:

Don't be so vehement, darling.

---

## VICTOR:

I'll never treat you like that.

---

## AMANDA:

That's right.

---

## VICTOR:

I love you too much.

---

## AMANDA:

So did he.

---

## VICTOR:

What a cad.

---

## AMANDA:

Yes, but don’t let’s talk about it anymore.

---

## AMANDA:

After all, it’s a dreary subject for our honeymoon night.

---

## VICTOR:

He didn’t know when he was well off.

---

## AMANDA:

Look at the lights of that yacht reflected in the water.

---

## AMANDA:

I wonder whose it is.

---

## VICTOR:

We must bathe tomorrow.

---

## AMANDA:

Yes. I want to get a nice sunburn.

---

## VICTOR:

Mandy!

---

## AMANDA:

Why, what’s the matter?

---

## VICTOR:

I hate sunburnt women.

---

## AMANDA:

Why?

---

## VICTOR:

It’s, well, somehow unsuitable.

---

## AMANDA:

It’s awfully suitable to me, darling.

---

## VICTOR:

Of course if you really want to.

---

## AMANDA:

I’m absolutely determined.

---

## AMANDA:

I’ve got masses of lovely oil to rub all over myself.

---

## VICTOR:

Your skin is so beautiful as it is.

---

## AMANDA:

Wait and see.

---

## AMANDA:

You’ll fall in love with me all over again.

---

## VICTOR:

I couldn’t love you more than I do now.

---

## AMANDA:

Oh, dear.

---

## AMANDA:

I did so hope our honeymoon was going to be progressive.

---

## VICTOR:

Where did you spend the last one?

---

## AMANDA:

Victor.

---

## VICTOR:

I want to know.

---

## AMANDA:

St. Moritz. It was very attractive.

---

## VICTOR:

I hate St. Moritz.

---

## AMANDA:

So do I.

---

## VICTOR:

Did he start quarreling with you right away?

---

## AMANDA:

Within the first few days.

---

## AMANDA:

I put it down to the high altitudes.

---

## VICTOR:

And you loved him?

---

## AMANDA:

Yes, Victor.

---

## VICTOR:

You poor child.

---

## AMANDA:

You must try not to be pompous, dear.

---

## VICTOR:

Mandy!

---

## AMANDA:

I don’t believe I’m a bit like what you think I am.

---

## VICTOR:

How do you mean?

---

## AMANDA:

I was never a poor child.

---

## VICTOR:

Figure of speech, dear, that’s all.

---

## AMANDA:

I suffered a great deal, and had my heart broken.

---

## AMANDA:

But it wasn’t an innocent girlish heart.

---

## AMANDA:

It was jagged with sophistication.

---

## AMANDA:

I’ve always been sophisticated, far too knowing.

---

## AMANDA:

That caused many of my rows with Elyot.

---

## AMANDA:

I irritated him because he knew I could see through him.

---

## VICTOR:

I don’t mind how much you see through me.

---

## AMANDA:

Sweet.

---

## VICTOR:

I’m going to make you happy.

---

## AMANDA:

Are you?

---

## VICTOR:

Just by looking after you, and seeing that you’re alright, you know.

---

## AMANDA:

No, I don’t know.

---

## VICTOR:

I think you love me quite differently from the way you loved Elyot.

---

## AMANDA:

Do stop harping on Elyot.

---

## VICTOR:

It’s true, though, isn’t it?

---

## AMANDA:

I love you much more calmly, if that's what you mean.

---

## VICTOR:

More lastingly?

---

## AMANDA:

I expect so.

---

## VICTOR:

Do you remember when I first met you?

---

## AMANDA:

Yes. Distinctly.

---

## VICTOR:

At Marion Vale’s party.

---

## AMANDA:

Yes.

---

## VICTOR:

Wasn’t it wonderful?

---

## AMANDA:

Not really, darling.

---

## AMANDA:

It was only redeemed from the completely commonplace

---

## AMANDA:

by the fact of my having the hiccoughs.

---

## VICTOR:

I never noticed them.

---

## AMANDA:

Love at first sight.

---

## VICTOR:

Where did you first meet Elyot?

---

## AMANDA:

To hell with Elyot!!

---

## VICTOR:

Mandy!

---

## AMANDA:

I forbid you to mention his name again.

---

## AMANDA:

I’m sick of the sound of it.

---

## AMANDA:

You must be raving mad.

---

## AMANDA:

Here we are on our honeymoon,

---

## AMANDA:

with the moon coming up, and the music playing,

---

## AMANDA:

and all you can do is to talk about my first husband.

---

## AMANDA:

It’s downright sacrilegious.

---

## VICTOR:

Don’t be angry.

---

## AMANDA:

Well, it’s very annoying.

---

## VICTOR:

Will you forgive me?

---

## AMANDA:

Yes; only don’t do it again.

---

## VICTOR:

I promise.

---

## AMANDA:

You should go and dress now, you haven’t bathed yet.

---

## VICTOR:

Where shall we dine, downstairs here,

---

## VICTOR:

or at the Casino?

---

## AMANDA:

The Casino is more fun, I think.

---

## VICTOR:

We can play a nice game of boule afterwards.

---

## AMANDA:

No, dear, we can’t.

---

## VICTOR:

Don’t you like dear old boule?

---

## AMANDA:

No, I hate dear old boule.

---

## AMANDA:

We’ll play a nice game of chemin de fer.

---

## VICTOR:

Not at the big table?

---

## AMANDA:

Maybe at the biggest table.

---

## VICTOR:

You’re not a terrible gambler, are you?

---

## AMANDA:

Inveterate. Chance rules my life.

---

## VICTOR:

What nonsense.

---

## AMANDA:

How can you say it’s nonsense?

---

## AMANDA:

It was chance meeting you. It was chance falling love;

---

## AMANDA:

it’s chance that we’re here,

---

## AMANDA:

particularly after your driving.

---

## AMANDA:

Everything that happens is chance.

---

## VICTOR:

You know I feel rather scared of you at close quarters.

---

## AMANDA:

That promises to very embarrassing.

---

## VICTOR:

You’re somehow different now

---

## VICTOR:

wilder than I thought you were

---

## VICTOR:

more strained.

---

## AMANDA:

Wilder!

---

## AMANDA:

Oh, Victor, I’ve never felt less wild in my life.

---

## AMANDA:

A bit strained, I grant you,

---

## AMANDA:

but that’s the newly married atmosphere;

---

## AMANDA:

you can’t expect anything else.

---

## AMANDA:

Honeymooning is a very overrated amusement.

---

## VICTOR:

You say that because you had a ghastly experience before.

---

## AMANDA:

There you go again.

---

## VICTOR:

It couldn’t fail to embitter you a little.

---

## AMANDA:

The honeymoon wasn’t such a ghastly experience really;

---

## AMANDA:

it was afterwards that was so awful.

---

## VICTOR:

I intend to make you forget it entirely.

---

## AMANDA:

You won’t succeed by making constant references to it.

---

## VICTOR:

I wish I knew you better.

---

## AMANDA:

It’s just as well you don’t.

---

## AMANDA:

The “woman” –in italics-

---

## AMANDA:

should always retain a certain amount of alluring feminine mystery

---

## AMANDA:

for the “man” –also in italics.

---

## VICTOR:

What about the man?

---

## VICTOR:

Is he allowed to have any mystery?

---

## AMANDA:

Absolutely none. Transparent as glass.

---

## VICTOR:

Oh, I see.

---

## AMANDA:

Don't worry, darling;

---

## AMANDA:

it doesn’t always work out like that;

---

## AMANDA:

it’s only supposed to.

---

## VICTOR:

I’m glad I’m normal.

---

## AMANDA:

What an odd thing to be glad about. Why?

---

## VICTOR:

Well, aren’t you?

---

## AMANDA:

I’m not so sure I’m normal.

---

## VICTOR:

Oh, Mandy, of course you are,

---

## VICTOR:

sweetly, divinely normal.

---

## AMANDA:

I haven’t any peculiar cravings, if that’s what you mean.

---

## VICTOR:

Mandy!

---

## AMANDA:

I think very few people are completely normal,

---

## AMANDA:

really deep down in their private lives.

---

## AMANDA:

It all depends on a combination of circumstances.

## AMANDA:

If all the various cosmic thingummys fuse at the same moment,

---

## AMANDA:

and the right spark is struck,

---

## AMANDA:

there’s no knowing what one mightn’t do.

---

## AMANDA:

That was the trouble with Elyot and me,

---

## AMANDA:

we were like two violent acids bubbling about

---

## AMANDA:

in a nasty little matrimonial bottle.

---

## VICTOR:

I don’t believe you’re nearly as complex as you think you are.

---

## AMANDA:

I don’t think I’m particularly complex,

---

## AMANDA:

but I know I’m unreliable.

---

## VICTOR:

You’re frightening me horribly.

---

## VICTOR:

In what way unreliable?

---

## AMANDA:

I’m so apt to see things the wrong way around.

---

## VICTOR:

What sort of things?

---

## AMANDA:

Morals.

---

## AMANDA:

What one should do and what one shouldn’t.

---

## VICTOR:

Darling, you’re so sweet.

---

## AMANDA:

Thank you, Victor, that’s most encouraging.

---

## AMANDA:

Come now, you really should have your bath.
Come along.

---

## VICTOR:

Kiss me.

---

## AMANDA:

There. Now, hurry now;

---

## AMANDA:

I’ve only got to slip my dress on then I shall be ready.

---

## VICTOR:

Give me ten minutes.

---

## AMANDA:

I’ll bring the cocktails out here when they come.

---

## VICTOR:

All right.

---

## AMANDA:

Come along!

---

## ELYOT:

Sibyl.

---

## SIBYL:

Yes.

---

## ELYOT:

I’ve brought the cocktails out here, hurry up.

---

## SIBYL:

I can’t find my lipstick.

---

## ELYOT:

Never mind, send down to the kitchen for some cochineal.

---

## SIBYL:

Don’t be silly.

---

## ELYOT:

Hurry.

Thoughtful of them to play that, wasn’t it?

---

## ELYOT:

What are you doing here?

---

## AMANDA:

I’m on honeymoon.

---

## ELYOT:

How interesting, so am I.

---

## AMANDA:

I hope you’re enjoying it.

---

## ELYOT:

It hasn’t started yet.

---

## AMANDA:

Neither has mine.

---

## ELYOT:

Oh, my God!

---

## AMANDA:

I can’t help feeling that this is a little unfortunate.

---

## ELYOT:

Are you happy?

---

## AMANDA:

Perfectly.

---

## ELYOT:

Good. That’s all right, then, isn’t it?

---

## AMANDA:

Are you?

---

## ELYOT:

Ecstatically.

---

## AMANDA:

I’m delighted to hear it.

---

## AMANDA:

We shall probably meet again sometime. Au revior!

---

## ELYOT:

Good-bye.

---

## SIBYL:

Cocktail, please.

---

## SIBYL:

Elli, what’s the matter?

---

## ELYOT:

I feel very odd.

---

## SIBYL:

Odd? what do you mean, ill?

---

## ELYOT:

Yes, ill.

---

## SIBYL:

What sort of ill?

---

## ELYOT:

We must leave.

---

## SIBYL:

Leave!

---

## ELYOT:

Yes, dear. Leave immediately.

---

## SIBYL:

Elli!

---

## ELYOT:

I have a strange foreboding.

---

## SIBYL:

You must be mad.

---

## ELYOT:

Darling, I want you to be very sweet and patient,
and understanding,

---

## ELYOT:

and not ask any questions, or anything.

---

## ELYOT:

I have the most extraordinary conviction that our whole future happiness

---

## ELYOT:

depends upon our leaving here instantly.

---

## SIBYL:

Why?

---

## ELYOT:

I can’t tell you why.

---

## SIBYL:

But we’ve only just come.

---

## ELYOT:

I know, it can’t be helped.

---

## SIBYL:

What’s happened, what has happened?

---

## ELYOT:

Nothing has happened.

---

## SIBYL:

You’ve gone out of your mind.

---

## ELYOT:

I haven’t gone out of my mind,

---

## ELYOT:

but I shall if we stay here another hour.

---

## SIBYL:

You’re not, not drunk, are you?

---

## ELYOT:

Of course, I’m not drunk.

---

## ELYOT:

What time have I had to get drunk?

---

## SIBYL:

Come down and have some dinner, darling,

---

## SIBYL:

and then you’ll feel ever so much better.

---

## ELYOT:

It’s no use trying to humor me. I’m serious.

---

## SIBYL:

But darling, please be reasonable.

---

## SIBYL:

We’ve only just arrived; everything’s unpacked.

---

## SIBYL:

It’s our first night together. We can’t go away now.

---

## ELYOT:

We can have our first night together in Paris.

---

## SIBYL:

We shouldn’t get there until the small hours.

---

## ELYOT:

Now please, Sibyl,

---

## ELYOT:

I know it sounds utterly crazy to you, and lacking in reason and sense,

---

## ELYOT:

but the truth is I’ve got second sight about certain things.

---

## ELYOT:

I’m almost psychic.

---

## ELYOT:

I’ve got the most extraordinary sensation of impending disaster.

---

## ELYOT:

If we stay here something appalling will happen.

---

## ELYOT:

I know it.

---

## SIBYL:

Hysterical nonsense.

---

## ELYOT:

It isn’t hysterical nonsense.

---

## ELYOT:

Presentiments are far from being nonsense.

---

## ELYOT:

Look at the woman who canceled her passage on the Titanic.

---

## ELYOT:

All because of a presentiment.

---

## SIBYL:

I don’t see what that has to do with it.

---

## ELYOT:

It has everything to do with it.

---

## ELTOY:

She obeyed her instincts, that’s what she did,

---

## ELYOT:

and saved her life.

---

## ELYOT:

I only ask is to be allowed to obey my instincts.

---

## SIBYL:

Are you saying there’s going to be an earthquake or something?

---

## ELYOT:

Very possibly, very possibly indeed,

---

## ELYOT:

or perhaps a violent explosion.

---

## SIBYL:

They don’t have earthquakes in France.

---

## ELYOT:

On the contrary,

---

## ELYOT:

just the other week they felt a distinct shock at Toulon.

---

## SIBYL:

Yes, but that’s in the South where it’s hot.

---

## ELYOT:

Don’t quibble, Sibyl.

---

## SIBYL:

And as for explosions,

---

## SIBYL:

there’s nothing here that can explode.

---

## ELYOT:

Oho, isn’t there.

---

## SIBYL:

Yes, but Elli -
--

## ELYOT:

Darling, be sweet. Bear with me.

---

## ELYOT:

I beseech you to bear with me.

---

## SIBYL:

I don’t understand. It’s horrid of you to do this.

---

## ELYOT:

I’m not doing anything.

---

## ELYOT:

I’m only asking you, imploring you to come away from this place.

---

## SIBYL:

But I love it here.

---

## ELYOT:

There are thousands of other places far nicer.

---

## SIBYL:

It’s a pity we didn’t go to one of them.

---

## ELYOT:

Now, look here, Sibyl -

---

## SIBYL:

Yes, but why are you behaving like this?

---

## SIBYL:

Why, why, why?

---

## ELYOT:

Don’t ask why. Just...

---

## ELYOT:

give in to me.

---

## ELYOT:

I swear I’ll never ask you to give into me over anything again.

---

---

## SIBYL:

I won’t think of going tonight. It’s utterly ridiculous.

---

## SIBYL:

I’ve traveled quite enough for one day, and I’m tired.

---

## ELYOT:

You’re as obstinate as a mule.

---

## SIBYL:

I like that, I must say.

---

## ELYOT:

You’ve got your nasty little feet dug into the ground,

---

## ELYOT:

and you don’t intend to budge an inch, do you?

---

## SIBYL:

No, I do not.

---

## ELYOT:

If there’s one thing in this world that infuriates me,

---

## ELYOT:

it’s sheer wanton stubbornness.

---

## ELYOT:

I should like to cut off your head with a meat ax.

---

## SIBYL:

How dare you talk to me like that, on our honeymoon night.

---

## ELYOT:

Damn our honeymoon night!

---

## ELYOT:

Damn it, damn it, damn it.

---

## SIBYL:

Oh, Elli, Elli -

---

## ELYOT:

Stop crying.

---

## ELYOT:

Will you or will you not come away with me to Paris?

---

## SIBYL:

I’ve never been so miserable in my life.

---

## SIBYL:

You’re hateful and beastly.

---

## SIBYL:

Mother was perfectly right. She said you had shifty eyes.

---

## ELYOT:

Well, she can’t talk.

---

## ELYOT:

Hers are so close together, you couldn’t put a needle between them.

---

## SIBYL:

You don’t love me a little bit. I wish I were dead.

---

## ELYOT:

Will you or will you not come to Paris?

---

## SIBYL:

No, no I won’t.

---


## AMANDA: 

(offstage) Oh, my God!

---

## ELYOT:

Oh, my God!

---

## SIBYL:

Oh, Elli, Elli, Elli -

---

## VICTOR:

You were certainly right when you said you weren’t normal.

---

## VICTOR:

You’re behaving like a lunatic.

---

## AMANDA:

Not at all. All I have done is ask you a little favor.

---

## VICTOR:

Little favor indeed.

---

## AMANDA:

If we left now we could be in Paris in a few hours.

---

## VICTOR:

If we crossed Siberia by train we could be in China in a fortnight,

---

## VICTOR:

but I don’t see any reason to do it.

---

## AMANDA:

Oh, Victor darling – please,

---

## AMANDA:

please – be sensible, just for my sake.

---

## VICTOR:

Sensible!

---

## AMANDA:

Yes, sensible.

---

## AMANDA:

I shall be absolutely miserable if we stay here.

---

## AMANDA:

You don’t want me to be absolutely miserable all through my honeymoon, do you?

---

## VICTOR:

But why on earth didn’t you think of your sister’s tragedy before?

---

## AMANDA:

I forgot.

---

## VICTOR:

You couldn’t forget a thing like that.

---

## AMANDA:

I got the places muddled.

---

## AMANDA:

Then when I saw the Casino there in the moonlight, it all came rushing back to me.

---

## VICTOR:

When did all this happen?

---

## AMANDA:

Years ago,

---

## AMANDA:

but it might just as well have been yesterday.

---

## AMANDA:

I can see her lying there, dead,

---

## AMANDA:

with that dreadful expression on her face.

---

## AMANDA:

Then that terrible business of getting the body home to England.

---

## AMANDA:

It was all perfectly horrible.

---

## VICTOR:

I never knew you had a sister.

---

## AMANDA:

I haven’t anymore.

---

## VICTOR:

There’s something behind all this.

---

## AMANDA:

Don’t be silly. What could there be behind it?

---

## VICTOR:

Well, for one thing, I know you’re lying.

---

## AMANDA:

Victor!

---

## VICTOR:

Be honest. Aren’t you?

---

## AMANDA:

I can’t think how you can be so mean and suspicious.

---

## VICTOR:

You’re lying, Amanda. Aren’t you?

---

## AMANDA:

Yes, Victor.

---

## VICTOR:

You never had a sister, dead or alive?

---

## VICTOR:

What is your reason for all this?

---

## AMANDA:

I told you I was unreliable.

---

## VICTOR:

Why do you want to leave so badly?

---

## AMANDA:

You’ll be angry if I tell you the truth.

---

## VICTOR:

What is it?

---

## AMANDA:

I warn you.

---

## VICTOR:

Tell me. Please tell me.

---

## AMANDA:

Elyot’s here.

---

## VICTOR:

What?

---

## AMANDA:

I saw him.

---

## VICTOR:

When?

---

## AMANDA:

Just now, when you were in the bath.

---

## VICTOR:

Where was he?

---

## AMANDA:

Down there, in a white suit.

---

## VICTOR:

White suit?

---

## AMANDA:

Why not? It’s summer, isn’t it?

---

## VICTOR:

You’re lying again.

---

## AMANDA:

I’m not. He’s here. I swear he is.

---

## VICTOR:

Well, what of it?

---

## AMANDA:

I can’t enjoy a honeymoon with you,

---

## AMANDA:

with Elyot liable to bounce in at any moment.

---

## VICTOR:

Really, Mandy.

---

## AMANDA:

Can’t you see how awful it is?

---

## AMANDA:

The most embarrassing thing that ever happened to me in my entire life.

---

## VICTOR:

Did he see you?

---

## AMANDA:

No, he was running.

---

## VICTOR:

What was he running for?

---

## AMANDA:

How should I know? Don’t be so annoying.

---

## VICTOR:

Well, if he didn't see you it's all right.

---

## AMANDA:

It isn’t all right. We must leave immediately.

---

## VICTOR:

But why?

---

## AMANDA:

How can you be so appallingly obstinate?

---

## VICTOR:

I’m not afraid of him.

---

## AMANDA:

Neither am I. It's not an issue of being afraid of him.

---

## AMANDA:

It’s just a horrible awkward situation.

---

## VICTOR:

I’m damned if I can see why our whole honeymoon should be upset by Elyot.

---

## AMANDA:

My last one was.

---

## VICTOR:

I don’t believe he’s here at all.

---

## AMANDA:

He is I tell you. I saw him.

---

## VICTOR:

It was probably an optical illusion.

---

## VICTOR:

This half-light is very deceptive.

---

## AMANDA:

It was no such thing.

---

## VICTOR:

I absolutely refuse to change all our plans at the last moment,

---

## VICTOR:

just because you think you’ve seen Elyot.

---

## VICTOR:

It’s unreasonable and ridiculous of you to demand it.

---

## VICTOR:

Even if he is here I can’t see that it matters.

---

## VICTOR:

He’ll probably feel much more embarrassed than you, and a damned good job too;

---

## VICTOR:

and if he annoys you in any way I’ll knock him down.

---

## AMANDA:

That would be charming.

---

## VICTOR:

Now don’t let’s talk about it any more.

---

## AMANDA:

Do you mean to stand there seriously and imagine that the whole thing can be glossed over as easily as that?

---

## VICTOR:

I’m not going to leave, Mandy.

---

## VICTOR:

If I start giving into you as early as this, our lives will be unbearable.

---

## AMANDA:

Victor!

---

## VICTOR:

You’ve worked yourself up into a state over a situation which really only exists in your mind.

---

## AMANDA:

Victor, please, please,

---

## AMANDA:

for this last time I implore you, please,

---

## AMANDA:

Let’s go to Paris now, tonight, please,

---

## AMANDA:

I mean it with all my heart, please --

---

## VICTOR:

No.

---

## AMANDA:

I see quite clearly that I have been foolish enough to marry a fat old gentleman in a club armchair.

---

## VICTOR:

It’s no use being cross.

---

## AMANDA:

You’re a pompous ass.

---

## VICTOR:

Mandy!

---

## AMANDA:

Pompous ass, that’s what I said, and that’s what I meant.

---

## AMANDA:

Blown out with your own importance.

---

## VICTOR:

Mandy, control yourself.

---

## AMANDA:

Get away from me.

---

## AMANDA:

I can’t bear to think I’m married to such a rugged grandeur.

---

## VICTOR:

I shall be in the bar.

---

## VICTOR:

When you are ready to come down and dine, let me know.

---

## AMANDA:

Go away, go away.

---

## ELYOT:

If you don’t stop screaming, I’ll murder you.

---

## SIBYL:

I wish to heaven I’d never seen you before, let alone married you.

---

## SIBYL:

I don’t wonder Amanda left you, if you behaved to her as you’ve behaved to me.

---

## SIBYL:

I’m going down to have dinner by myself,

---

## SIBYL:

and you can just do what you like about it.

---

## ELYOT:

Do, and I hope it chokes you.

---

## SIBYL:

Oh Elli, Elli –

---

## AMANDA:

Give me one for God’s sake.

---

## ELYOT:

Here.

---

## AMANDA:

I’m in such a rage.
--

## ELYOT:

So am I.

---

## AMANDA:

What are we to do?
--

## ELYOT:

I don’t know.

---

## AMANDA:

Whose yacht is that?

---

## ELYOT:

The Duke of Westminster’s I expect. It always is.

---

## AMANDA:

I wish I were on it.

---

## ELYOT:

I wish you were too.

---

## AMANDA:

There’s no need to be nasty.

---

## ELYOT:

Yes there is, every need.

---

## ELYOT:

I’ve never in my life felt a greater urge to be nasty.

---

## AMANDA:

And you’ve had some urges in your time, haven’t you.

---

## ELYOT:

If you start bickering with me, Amanda, I swear I’ll throw you over the edge.

---

## AMANDA:

Try it, that’s all, just try it.

---

## ELYOT:

You’ve upset everything, as usual.

---

## AMANDA:

I’ve upset everything! What about you?

---

## ELYOT:

Ever since the first moment I was unlucky enough to set eyes on you,

---

## ELYOT:

my life has been insupportable.

---

## AMANDA:

Oh, do shut up, there’s no sense in going on like that.

---

## ELYOT:

Nothing that’s any use. There’s no escape, ever.

---

## AMANDA:

Don’t be melodramatic.

---

## ELYOT:

Do you want a cocktail? There are two here.

---

## AMANDA:

There are two over here as well.

---

## ELYOT:

We’ll have my two first.

---

## AMANDA:

Shall we get roaring screaming drunk?

---

## ELYOT:

We tried that once before and it was a dismal failure.

---

## AMANDA:

It was lovely at the beginning.

---

## ELYOT:

You have an immoral memory, Amanda.

---

## ELYOT:

Here’s to you.

---

## AMANDA:

I tried to get him to leave the moment after I’d seen you,

---

## AMANDA:

but he wouldn’t budge.

---

## ELYOT:

What’s his name?

---

## AMANDA:

Victor, Victor Prynne.

---

## ELYOT:

Mr. and Mrs. Victor Prynne.

---

## ELYOT:

Mine wouldn’t budge.

---

## AMANDA:

What’s her name?

---

## ELYOT:

Sibyl.

---

## AMANDA:

Mr. and Mrs. Elyot Chase.

---

## AMANDA:

God pity the poor girl.

---

## ELYOT:

Are you in love with him?

---

## AMANDA:

Of course.

---

## ELYOT:

How funny.

---

## AMANDA:

I don’t see anything particularly funny about it;

---

## AMANDA:

you’re in love with yours aren’t you?

---

## ELYOT:

Certainly.

---

## AMANDA:

There you are then.

---

## ELYOT:

There we both are then.

---

## AMANDA:

What’s she like?

---

## ELYOT:

Very pretty, plays the piano beautifully.

---

## AMANDA:

Very comforting.

---

## ELYOT:

How’s yours?

---

## AMANDA:

I don’t wish to discuss him.

---

## ELYOT:

Well, it doesn’t matter,

---

## ELYOT:

he’ll probably come popping out in a minute and I shall see for myself.

---

## ELYOT:

Does he know I’m here?

---

## AMANDA:

Yes, I told him.

---

## ELYOT:

That’s going to make things a whole lot easier.

---

## AMANDA:

You needn’t be frightened; he won’t hurt you.

---

## ELYOT:

If he comes near me I’ll scream the place down.

---

## AMANDA:

Does Sibyl know I’m here?

---

## ELYOT:

No, I pretended I’d had a presentiment.

---

## ELYOT:

I tried terribly hard to persuade her to come away with me to Paris.

---

## AMANDA:

I tried too;

---

## AMANDA:

We're lucky we didn’t both succeed,

---

## AMANDA:

otherwise we might have all have joined up somewhere together along the way.

---

## ELYOT:

In some frowsy little hotel in Rouen.
--

## AMANDA:

Rouen!

---

## AMANDA:

Oh that would have been much, much worse.

---

## ELYOT:

I can see us all sailing down in the morning for an early start.

---

## AMANDA:

Lovely, oh lovely.

---

## ELYOT:

Glorious!

---

## AMANDA:

What’s happened to yours?

---

## ELYOT:

Didn’t you hear her screaming?

---

## ELYOT:

She’s downstairs in the dining room I think.

---

## AMANDA:

Mine is being grand, in the bar.

---

## ELYOT:

It really is awfully difficult.

---

## AMANDA:

Have you known her long?

---

## ELYOT:

About four months,

---

## ELYOT:

we met at a house party in Norfolk.

---

## AMANDA:

Very flat, Norfolk.

---

## ELYOT:

How old is dear Victor?

---

## AMANDA:

Thirty-four, or five

---

## AMANDA:

and Sibyl?

---

## ELYOT:

I blush to tell you only twenty-three.

---

## AMANDA:

You’ve gone a mucker alright.

---

## ELYOT:

I shall reserve my opinion of your choice until I’ve met dear Victor.

---

## AMANDA:

I do wish you would stop calling him “Dear Victor.”

---

## AMANDA:

It’s extremely irritating.

---

## ELYOT:

That’s how I see him.

---

## ELYOT:

Dumpy, and fair, and courteous, with glasses.

---

## ELYOT:

Dear Victor.

---

## AMANDA:

I asked you not to discuss him.

---

## AMANDA:

At least I have good taste enough to refrain from making cheap jibes at Sibyl.

---

## ELYOT:

You said Norfolk was flat.

---

## AMANDA:

That was no reflection on her,

---

## AMANDA:

unless she made it flatter.

---

## ELYOT:

Your voice takes on an acid quality whenever you mention her name.

---

## AMANDA:

I’ll never mention it again.

---

## ELYOT:

Good, and I’ll keep off Victor.

---

## AMANDA:

Thank you.

I wouldn’t have had it happen for the world.

I know. I’m sorry too. It’s just rotten luck.

I’ll go away tomorrow whatever happens, so don’t you worry.

That’s kind of you.

## AMANDA:

and everybody whirling round in vivid colors,

---

## AMANDA:

and you kneeling down to put on my skates for me.

---

## ELYOT:

You’d fallen on your fanny a few moments before.

---

## AMANDA:

It was beastly of you to laugh like that, I was so humiliated.

---

## ELYOT:

Poor darling.

---

## AMANDA:

Do you remember waking up in the morning,

---

## AMANDA:

and standing on the balcony, looking out across the valley?

---

## ELYOT:

Blue shadows on white snow,

---

## ELYOT:

cleanness beyond belief, high above everything in the world.

---

## ELYOT:

How beautiful it was.

---

## AMANDA:

It’s nice to think we had a few marvelous moments.

---

## ELYOT:

A few?

---

## ELYOT:

We had heaps really, only they slip away into the background,

---

## ELYOT:

and one only remembers the bad ones.

---

## AMANDA:

Yes. What fools we were to ruin it all.

---

## AMANDA:

What utter, utter fools.

---

## ELYOT:

You feel like that too, do you?

---

## AMANDA:

Of course.

---

## ELYOT:

Why did we?

---

## AMANDA:

The whole business was too much for us.

---

## ELYOT:

We were so ridiculously over in love.

---

## AMANDA:

Funny, wasn’t it?

---

## ELYOT:

Horribly funny.

---

## AMANDA:

Selfishness, cruelty, hatred, possessiveness, petty jealousy.

---

## AMANDA:

All those qualities came out in us just because we loved each other.

---

## ELYOT:

Perhaps they were there anyhow.

---

## AMANDA:

No, it’s love that does it.

---

## AMANDA:

To hell with love.

---

## ELYOT:

To hell with love.

---

## AMANDA:

And yet here we are

---

## AMANDA:

both of us starting afresh with two quite different people.

---

## AMANDA:

In love all over again, aren’t we?

---

_'Cause I'm your lady--_

---

## AMANDA:

Aren’t we?

---

## ELYOT:

No.

---

## AMANDA:

Elyot.

---

## ELYOT:

We’re not in love all over again, and you know it.

---

## ELYOT:

Goodnight, Amanda.

---

## AMANDA:

Elyot – don’t be silly – come back.

---

## ELYOT:

I must go and find Sibyl.

---

## AMANDA:

I must go and find Victor.

---

## ELYOT:

Well, why don’t you?

---

## AMANDA:

I don’t want to.

---

## ELYOT:

It’s shameful, shameful of us.

---

## AMANDA:

Don’t: I feel terrible.

---

## AMANDA:

Come back come back come back!

---

## AMANDA:

We won’t talk about ourselves any more;

---

## AMANDA:

we’ll talk about outside things,

---

## AMANDA:

only don’t leave me until I’ve pulled myself together.

---

## ELYOT:

All right.

---

_And you are my man..._

---

## AMANDA:

What have you been doing lately these last years?

---

## ELYOT:

Traveling about.

---

## ELYOT:

I went round the world you know after -

---

## AMANDA:

Yes, yes, I know. How was it?

---

## ELYOT:

The world?

---

## AMANDA:

Yes.

---

## ELYOT:

Oh, highly enjoyable.

---

## AMANDA:

China must be very interesting.

---

## ELYOT:

Very big, China.

---

## AMANDA:

And Japan -

---

## ELYOT:

Very small.

---

## AMANDA:

Did you eat shark’s fins, and take your shoes off,

---

## AMANDA:

and use chopsticks and everything?

---

## ELYOT:

Practically everything.

---

## AMANDA:

And India, the burning Ghars, or Ghats, or

---

## AMANDA:

whatever they are,

---

## AMANDA:

and the Taj Mahal. How was the Taj Mahal?

---

## ELYOT:

Unbelievable, a sort of dream.

---

## AMANDA:

That was the moonlight,

---

## AMANDA:

I expect you must have seen it in the moonlight.

---

## ELYOT:

Yes, moonlight can be cruelly deceptive.

---

## AMANDA:

And it didn’t look like a biscuit box did it? I’ve always felt that it might.

---

## ELYOT:

Darling--

---

## AMANDA:

And I do hope you met a sacred elephant.
--

## ELYOT:

Darling--

---

## AMANDA:

They’re lint white I believe, and very, very sweet.

---

## ELYOT:

I do love you so.

---

## ELYOT:

I’ve never loved anyone else for an instant.

---

## AMANDA:

No, Elyot, you mustn't.

---

## ELYOT:

You love me, too, don’t you?

---

## ELYOT:

There’s no doubt about it anywhere, is there?

---

## AMANDA:

No, no doubt anywhere.

---

## ELYOT:

You’re looking awfully lovely in this damned moonlight, you know.

---

## ELYOT:

Your skin is clear and cool, and your eyes are shining,

---

## ELYOT:

and you’re growing lovelier and lovelier every second as I look at you.

---

## ELYOT:

You don’t hold any mystery for me, darling, do you mind?

---

## ELYOT:

There isn’t a particle of you that I don’t know, remember, and want.

---

## AMANDA:

I’m glad, my sweet.

---

## ELYOT:

More than any desire anywhere,

---

## ELYOT:

deep down in my deepest heart I want you back again.

---

## ELYOT:

Please --

---

## AMANDA:

Don’t say any more;

---

## AMANDA:

you’re making me cry so dreadfully.

[MUSIC FADES]

---

## AMANDA:

What now? Oh darling, what now?

---

## ELYOT:

I don’t know, I’m lost, utterly.

---

## AMANDA:

We must think quickly, oh quickly -

---

## ELYOT:

Escape?

---

## AMANDA:

Together?

---

## ELYOT:

Yes, of course, now, now.

---

## AMANDA:

We can’t, we can’t, you know we can’t.

---

## ELYOT:

We must.

---

## AMANDA:

It would break Victor’s heart.

---

## ELYOT:

And Sibyl’s too I expect,

---

## ELYOT:

but they’re bound to suffer anyhow.

---

## ELYOT:

Think of the hell we’d lead them into if we stayed.

---

## ELYOT:

Infinitely worse than any cruelty in the world, pretending to love them,

---

## ELYOT:

and loving each other, so desperately.

---

## AMANDA:

We must tell them.

---

## ELYOT:

What?

---

## AMANDA:

Call them, and tell them.

---

## ELYOT:

Oh no, no, that’s impossible.

---

## AMANDA:

It’s honest.

---

## ELYOT:

I can’t help how honest it is, it’s too horrible to think of.

---

## ELYOT:

How should we start? What should we say?

---

## AMANDA:

We should have to trust to the inspiration of the moment.

---

## ELYOT:

It would be a moment entirely devoid of inspiration.

---

## ELYOT:

The most appalling moment imaginable.

---

## ELYOT:

We can’t, you must see that, we simply can’t.

---

## AMANDA:

What do you propose to do then?

---

## AMANDA:

As it is they might appear at any moment.

---

## ELYOT:

We’ve got to decide instantly one way or another:

---

## ELYOT:

Leave together now, or stay with them
and never see one another again, ever.

---

## AMANDA:

Don’t be silly, what choice is there?

---

## ELYOT:

No choice at all, come –

---

## AMANDA:

No, no wait, something has happened to us,

---

## AMANDA:

This is sheer raving madness, we're not sane--

---

## ELYOT:

We never were.

---

## AMANDA:

Where can we go?

---

## ELYOT:

Paris first,

---

## ELYOT:

My car’s in the garage, all ready.

---

## AMANDA:

They’ll follow us.

---

## ELYOT:

That doesn’t matter, once the thing’s done.

---

## AMANDA:

I’ve got a flat in Paris.

---

## ELYOT:

Good.

---

## AMANDA:

It’s in the Avenue Montaigne.

---

## AMANDA:

I let it to Freda Lawson

---

## AMANDA:

but she’s in Biarritz, so it’s empty.

---

## ELYOT:

Does Victor know?

---

## AMANDA:

No, he knows I have one but he hasn’t the faintest idea where.

---

## ELYOT:

Better and better.

---

## AMANDA:

This is terrible, terrible, we’ll suffer for this, I know we shall.

---

## ELYOT:

Can’t be helped.

---

## AMANDA:

Starting all those awful rows all over again.

---

## ELYOT:

No, no, we’re older and wiser now.

---

## AMANDA:

What difference does that make?

---

## AMANDA:

The first moment either of us gets a bit nervy, off we’ll go again.

---

## ELYOT:

Stop shilly-shallying, Amanda.

---

## AMANDA:

I’m trying to be sensible.

---

## ELYOT:

You’re only succeeding in being completely idiotic.

---

## AMANDA:

Idiotic! What about you?

---

## ELYOT:

Now see here Amanda -

---

## AMANDA:

Oh my God!

---

## ELYOT:

Darling, darling, I didn’t mean it -

---

## AMANDA:

I will not move from this spot
unless we have a compact,

---

## AMANDA:

a sacred, sacred compact never to quarrel again.

---

## ELYOT:

Easy to make but difficult to keep.

---

## AMANDA:

No, no, it’s the bickering that always starts it.

---

## AMANDA:

The moment we notice we’re bickering,
we must promise on our honor to stop dead.

---

## AMANDA:

We’ll invent some phrase or catchword,
which when either of us says it,

---

## AMANDA:

automatically cuts off all conversation for at least five minutes.

---

## ELYOT:

Two minutes dear, with an option of renewal.

---

## AMANDA:

Very well, what shall it be?

---

## ELYOT:

Solomon Issacs.

---

## AMANDA:

All right, that’ll do.

---

## ELYOT:

Come on, come on.

---

## AMANDA:

What shall we do if we meet either of them on the way downstairs?

---

## ELYOT:

Run like stags.

---

## AMANDA:

What about clothes?

---

## ELYOT:

I’ve got a couple of bags I haven’t unpacked yet.

---

## AMANDA:

I’ve got a small trunk.

---

## ELYOT:

Send the porter up for it.

---

## AMANDA:

Oh this is terrible – terrible -

---

## ELYOT:

Come on, come on, don’t waste time.

---

## AMANDA:

Oughtn’t we leave notes or something?

---

## ELYOT:

No, no, no, we’ll telegraph from somewhere on the road.

---

## AMANDA:

Darling, I daren’t,

---

## AMANDA:

it’s too wicked of us, I simply daren’t.

---

_The power of love_

---

## ELYOT:

Now will you behave?

---

## AMANDA:

Yes, but Elyot daring -

---

## ELYOT:

Solomon Issacs!

Good evening.

## SIBYL:

Good evening.

---

## SIBYL:

I was – er – looking for my husband.

---

## VICTOR:

Really, that’s funny. I was looking for my wife.

---

## SIBYL:

Quite a coincidence.

---

## VICTOR:

It’s very pretty isn’t it?

---

## SIBYL:

Lovely.

---

## VICTOR:

Have you been here long?

---

## SIBYL:

No, we only arrived today.

---

## VICTOR:

Another coincidence. So did we.

---

## SIBYL:

How awfully funny.

---

## VICTOR:

Would you care for a cocktail?

---

## SIBYL:

Oh no, thank you – really -

---

## VICTOR:

There are two here on the table.

## SIBYL:

Thank you, I’d love one.

## VICTOR:

Good, here you are.

## SIBYL:

Thank you.

To absent friends.

## SIBYL:

To absent friends.

INTERMISSION

[WHIMSICAL PIANO MUSIC]

---

## LOUISE:

L'appartement d'Amanda à Paris.

---

## LOUISE:

Quelques jours se sont passé.

---

## LOUISE:

Il est environ dix heures du soir.

---

## LOUISE:

Les fenêtres sont ouvertes et les bruits divers de la rue parisienne peuvent être entendus.

---

## LOUISE:

Amanda et Elyot ont fini de dîner et s'attardent avec du café et des digestifs.

---

[MUSIC FADES]

---

## AMANDA:

I’m glad we let Louise go.

---

## AMANDA:

I am afraid she is going to have a cold.

---

## ELYOT:

Going to have a cold;

---

## ELYOT:

she’s been grunting and snorting all the evening like a whole herd of bison.

---

## AMANDA:

Bison never sounds right to me somehow.

---

## AMANDA:

I have a feeling it ought to be bisons,

---

## AMANDA:

a flock of bisons.

---

## ELYOT:

You might even say a covey of bisons, or a school of bisons.

---

## AMANDA:

Yes, lovely. The Royal London School of Bisons.

---

## AMANDA:

Do you think Louise is happy at home?

---

## ELYOT:

No, profoundly miserable.

---

## AMANDA:

Family beastly to her?

---

## ELYOT:

Absolutely vile. Knock her about dreadfully I expect,

---

## ELYOT:

make her eat the most disgusting food, and pull her fringe.

---

## AMANDA:

Oh, poor Louise.

---

## ELYOT:

Well, you know what the French are.

---

## AMANDA:

Yes. I know what the Hungarians are too.

---

## ELYOT:

What are they?

---

## AMANDA:

Very wistful.

---

## AMANDA:

It’s all those pretzels I shouldn’t wonder.

---

## ELYOT:

And the Poostza;

---

## ELYOT:

I always felt the Poostza was far too big, Danube or no Danube.

---

## AMANDA:

Have you ever crossed the Sahara on a Camel?

---

## ELYOT:

Frequently. When I was a boy we used to do it all the time.

---

## ELYOT:

My grandmother had a lovely seat on a camel.

---

## AMANDA:

There’s no doubt about it, foreign travel’s the thing.

---

## ELYOT:

Want some more brandy?

---

## AMANDA:

Just a little.

---

## ELYOT:

I’m glad we didn’t go out tonight.

---

## AMANDA:

Or last night.

---

## ELYOT:

Or the night before.

---

## AMANDA:

There’s no reason to, really, when we’re so cozy here.

---

## ELYOT:

Exactly.

---

## AMANDA:

It’s nice, isn’t it?

---

## ELYOT:

Strangely peaceful.

---

## ELYOT:

It’s an awfully bad reflection on our characters.

---

## ELYOT:

We ought to be absolutely tortured with conscience.

---

## AMANDA:

We are, every now and then.

---

## ELYOT:

Not nearly enough.

---

## AMANDA:

We sent Victor and Sibyl a nice note from wherever it was; what more can they want?

---

## ELYOT:

You’re even more ruthless than I am.

---

## AMANDA:

I don’t believe in crying over my bridge before I’ve eaten it.

---

## ELYOT:

Very sensible.

---

## AMANDA:

Personally I feel grateful for a miraculous escape.

---

## AMANDA:

I should never have been happy with Victor.

---

## AMANDA:

I was a fool ever to consider it.

---

## ELYOT:

You did a little more than consider it.

---

## AMANDA:

Well, you can’t talk.

---

## ELYOT:

I wonder if they've met each other, or whether they’re suffering alone.

---

## AMANDA:

Oh, don’t let’s think about it, it really does make one feel rather awful.

---

## ELYOT:

I suppose one or other of both of them will turn up here eventually.

---

## AMANDA:

Bound to; it won’t be very nice, will it?

---

## ELYOT:

Perfectly horrible.

---

## AMANDA:

Do you realize that we are living in sin?

---

## ELYOT:

Not according to the Catholics;

---

## ELYOT:

Catholics don’t recognize divorce.

---

## ELYOT:

We’re married as much as ever we were.

---

## AMANDA:

Yes, darling, but we’re not Catholics.

---

## ELYOT:

Oh never mind, it’s nice to think they’d sort of back us up.

---

## ELYOT:

We were married in the eyes of heaven, and we still are.

---

## AMANDA:

We may be alright in the eyes of Heaven, but we’re in a hell of a mess socially.

---

## ELYOT:

Who cares?

---

## AMANDA:

Will we marry again, when Victor and Sibyl divorce us?

---

## ELYOT:

I suppose so. What do you think?

---

## AMANDA:

I feel rather scared of marriage really.

---

## ELYOT:

It is a frowsy business.

---

## AMANDA:

I believe it was just the fact of our being married,

---

## AMANDA:

and clamped together publicly, that wrecked us before.

---

## ELYOT:

That, and not knowing how to manage each other.

---

## AMANDA:

Do you think we know how to manage each other now?

---

## ELYOT:

This week’s been highly successful.

---

## ELYOT:

We’ve hardly used Solomon Issacs at all.

---

## AMANDA:

Solomon Issacs is so long, let’s shorten it to Sollocks.

---

## ELYOT:

All right.

---

## AMANDA:

Darling, you do look awfully sweet in your little dressing gown.

---

## ELYOT:

Yes, it's pretty ravishing, isn’t it?

---

## AMANDA:

Do you mind if I come round and kiss you?

---

## ELYOT:

A pleasure, Lady Agatha.

---

## AMANDA:

What fools we were to subject ourselves to five years’ unnecessary suffering.

---

## ELYOT:

Perhaps it wasn’t unnecessary,

---

## ELYOT:

perhaps it mellowed and perfected us like beautiful ripe fruit.

---

## AMANDA:

When we were together,

---

## AMANDA:

did you really think I was unfaithful to you?

---

## ELYOT:

Yes, practically every day.

---

## AMANDA:

So did I;

---

## AMANDA:

I used to torture myself with visions of you

---

## AMANDA:

bouncing about on divans with awful widows.

---

## ELYOT:

Why widows?

---

## AMANDA:

I was thinking of Claire Lavenham really.

---

## ELYOT:

Oh, Claire.

---

## AMANDA:

What did you say “Oh, Claire” like that for?

---

## AMANDA:

It sounded far too careless to me.

---

## ELYOT:

What a lovely creature she was.

---

## AMANDA:

Lovely, lovely, lovely!

---

## ELYOT:

Darling!

---

## AMANDA:

Did you ever have an affair with her?

---

## AMANDA:

Afterwards I mean?

---

## ELYOT:

Why do you want to know?

---

## AMANDA:

Curiosity, I suppose.

---

## ELYOT:

Dangerous.

---

## AMANDA:

Oh not now, not dangerous now.

---

## AMANDA:

I wouldn’t expect you to have been celibate during those five years,

---

## AMANDA:

any more than I was.

---

## ELYOT:

What?

---

## AMANDA:

After all, Claire was undeniably attractive.

---

## AMANDA:

A trifle over vivacious I always thought,

---

## AMANDA:

but that was probably because she was fundamentally stupid.

---

## ELYOT:

What do you mean about not being celibate during those five years?

---

## AMANDA:

What do you think I mean?

---

## ELYOT:

Oh God

---

## AMANDA:

What’s the matter?

---

## ELYOT:

You know perfectly well what’s the matter.

---

## AMANDA:

You mustn’t be unreasonable,

---

## AMANDA:

I was only trying to stamp out the memory of you.

---

## AMANDA:

I expect your affairs far outnumbered mine anyhow.

---

## ELYOT:

That is a little different. I’m a man.

---

## AMANDA:

Excuse me while I get a caraway biscuit and change my crinoline.

---

## ELYOT:

It doesn’t suit women to be promiscuous.

---

## AMANDA:

It doesn’t suit men for women to be promiscuous.

---

## ELYOT:

Very modern dear;
really, your advanced views quite startle me.

---

## AMANDA:

Don’t be cross, Elyot, I haven’t been so dreadfully loose actually.

---

## AMANDA:

Five years is a long time,

---

## AMANDA:

and even if I did nip off with someone every now and again,

---

## AMANDA:

they were none of them very serious.

---

## ELYOT:

Oh, do stop it please -

---

## AMANDA:

Well, what about you?

---

## ELYOT:

Do you want me to tell you?

---

## AMANDA:

No, no, no.

---

## AMANDA:

I take everything back-
--

## ELYOT:

I was madly in love with a woman in South Africa!

---

## AMANDA:

We’re tormenting one another. Sit down, sweet, I’m scared.

---

## AMANDA:

We should have said Sollocks ages ago.

---

## ELYOT:

We’re in love all right.

---

## AMANDA:

Don’t say it so bitterly.

---

## AMANDA:

Let’s try to get the best out of it this time,
instead of the worst.

---

## ELYOT:

Hand, please.

---

## AMANDA:

Here.

---

## ELYOT:

More comfortable?

---

## AMANDA:

Much, much more.

---

## ELYOT:

Are you engaged for this dance?

---

## AMANDA:

Funnily enough I was, but my partner was suddenly taken ill.

---

## ELYOT:

It’s this damned smallpox epidemic.

---

## AMANDA:

No, as a matter of fact it was kidney trouble.

---

[MUSIC]

---

## ELYOT:

You’ll dance it with me I hope?

---

## AMANDA:

I shall be charmed.

---

[CHA-CHA MUSIC]

---

## ELYOT:

Quite a good floor, isn’t it?

---

## AMANDA:

Yes, I think it needs a little Borax.

---

## ELYOT:

I love Borax.

---

## AMANDA:

Is that the Grand Duchess Olga lying under the piano?

---

## ELYOT:

Yes, her husband died a few weeks ago, you know, on his way back from Pulborough. So sad.

---

## AMANDA:

What on earth was he doing in Pulborough?

---

## ELYOT:

Nobody knows exactly,

---

## ELYOT:

but there have been the usual stories.

---

## AMANDA:

I see.

---

## ELYOT:

Delightful parties Lady Bundle always gives, doesn’t she?

---

## AMANDA:

Entrancing. Such a dear old lady.

---

## ELYOT:

And so gay: Did you notice her at supper blowing all those shrimps through her ear trumpet?

---

## ELYOT:

What are you thinking about?

---

## AMANDA:

Nothing in particular.

---

## ELYOT:

Come on, I know that face.

---

## AMANDA:

Poor Sibyl.

---

## ELYOT:

Sibyl?

---

## AMANDA:

Yes, I suppose she loves you terribly.

---

## ELYOT:

Not as much as all that; she didn’t have a chance to get really under way.

---

## AMANDA:

I expect she’s dreadfully unhappy.

---

## ELYOT:

Oh, do shut up, Amanda, we’ve had all that out before.

---

## AMANDA:

We’ve certainly been spending a lot of time trying to justify ourselves.

---

## ELYOT:

It isn’t a question of justifying ourselves;

---

## ELYOT:

it’s the true values of the situation that are really important.

---

## ELYOT:

We knew from the moment we saw one another again there was no use going on.

---

## ELYOT:

We knew it instantly really,

---

## ELYOT:

although we tried to pretend to ourselves that we didn’t.

---

## ELYOT:

What we’ve got to be thankful for is that we made the break straight away, and not later.

---

## AMANDA:

You think we would have done it eventually?

---

## ELYOT:

Of course, and things would have been in a worse mess than they are now.

---

## AMANDA:

And what if we’d never happened to meet again.

---

## AMANDA:

Would you be quite happy with Sibyl?

---

## ELYOT:

I expect so.

---

## AMANDA:

Oh, Elyot!

---

## ELYOT:

You needn’t look so stricken.

---

## ELYOT:

It would have been the same with you and Victor.

---

## ELYOT:

Life would have been smooth, and amicable, and quite charming, wouldn’t it?

---

## AMANDA:

Poor dear Victor. He certainly did love me.

---

## ELYOT:

Splendid.

---

## AMANDA:

When I met him I was so lonely and depressed,

---

## AMANDA:

I felt that I was getting old and crumbling away unwanted.

---

## ELYOT:

It certainly is horrid when one begins to crumble.

---

## AMANDA:

Victor used to look at me hopelessly like a spaniel,

---

## AMANDA:

and I sort of melted like snow in the sunlight.

---

## ELYOT:

That must have been an edifying spectacle.

---

## AMANDA:

Victor really had a great charm.

---

## ELYOT:

You must tell me all about it.

---

## AMANDA:

He had a positive mania for looking after me, and protecting me.

---

## ELYOT:

That would have died down in time, dear.

---

## AMANDA:

No need to be rude; there’s no necessity to be rude.

---

## ELYOT:

I wasn’t in the least rude; I merely made a perfectly rational statement.

---

## AMANDA:

Your voice was decidedly bitter.

---

## ELYOT:

Victor had glorious legs, hadn’t he? And fascinating ears.

---

## AMANDA:

Don’t be silly.

---

## ELYOT:

He probably looked radiant in the morning, all flushed and tumbled on the pillow.

---

## AMANDA:

I never saw him on the pillow.

---

## ELYOT:

I’m surprised to hear it.

---

## AMANDA:

Elyot!

---

## ELYOT:

There’s no need to be cross.

---

## AMANDA:

What did you mean by that?

---

## ELYOT:

I’m sick of listening to you yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yapping about Victor.

---

## AMANDA:

Now listen Elyot, once and for all -

---

## ELYOT:

Oh my dear, Sollocks! Sollocks!
--

## AMANDA:

But -

---

## ELYOT:

Two minutes! Sollocks!

---

---

## ELYOT:

That was a near thing.

---

## AMANDA:

It was my fault. I’m terribly sorry, darling.

---

## ELYOT:

I was very irritating, I know I was.

---

## ELYOT:

I’m sure Victor was awfully nice, and you’re perfectly right to be sweet about him.

---

## AMANDA:

That’s downright handsome of you. Sweetheart!

---

## ELYOT:

I think I love you more than ever before. Isn’t it ridiculous?

---

## ELYOT:

Come on, put your feet up.

---

## AMANDA:

Comfortable?

---

## ELYOT:

Almost, wait a minute.

---

## AMANDA:

How long, Oh Lord, how long?

---

## ELYOT:

What do you mean, “How long, Oh Lord, how long?”

---

## AMANDA:

This is far too perfect to last.

---

## ELYOT:

You have no faith, that’s what’s wrong with you.

---

## AMANDA:

Absolutely none.

---

## ELYOT:

Don’t you believe in-?

---

## AMANDA:

No, do you?

---

## ELYOT:

No. What about- ?

---

## AMANDA:

Oh, dear no.

---

## ELYOT:

Don’t you believe in anything?

---

## AMANDA:

Yes, I believe in being kind to everyone,

---

## AMANDA:

and in giving money to old beggar women,

---

## AMANDA:

and in being as gay as possible.

---

## ELYOT:

What about after we’re dead?

---

## AMANDA:

I think a rather gloomy little merging into everything, don’t you?

---

## ELYOT:

I hope not; I’m a bad merger.

---

## AMANDA:

You won’t know a thing about it.

---

## ELYOT:

I hope for glorious oblivion, like being under gas.

---

## AMANDA:

I always dream the most peculiar things under gas.

---

## ELYOT:

Would you be young always? If you could choose?

---

## AMANDA:

No, I don’t think so.

---

## AMANDA:

Especially if it meant having those awful bull’s glands shot into me.

---

## ELYOT:

Cow glands for you, dear. Bulls for me.

---

## AMANDA:

We certainly live in a marvelous age.

---

## ELYOT:

Too marvelous.

---

## ELYOT:

It’s alright if you're a specialist at something,

---

## ELYOT:

then you’re too concentrated to pay attention to all the things going on.

---

## ELYOT:

But, for the ordinary observer, it’s too much.

---

## AMANDA:

Far, far too much.

---

## ELYOT:

Take the radio for instance.

---

## AMANDA:

Oh darling, don’t let’s take the radio.

---

## ELYOT:

Well, televisions then, or aeroplanes, or Cosmic Atoms, or those gland injections we were talking about just now.

---

## AMANDA:

It must be so nasty for those poor animals, being experimented on.

---

## ELYOT:

Not if the experiments are successful.

---

## ELYOT:

Why in Vienna I believe you can see whole lines of decrepit old rats carrying on like the Moulin Rouge.

---

## AMANDA:

Oh, how very, very sweet.

---

## ELYOT:

I do love you so.

---

## AMANDA:

Don’t blow, dear heart, it gives me the shivers.

---

## ELYOT:

Swivel your face round a bit more.

---

## AMANDA:

That better?

---

## ELYOT:

Very nice, thank you kindly.

---

## AMANDA:

Darling, you’re so terribly, terribly dear, and sweet, and attractive.

---

## ELYOT:

We were raving, ever to part, even for an instant.

---

## AMANDA:

Utter imbeciles.

---

## ELYOT:

I knew it almost instantly, didn’t you?

---

## AMANDA:

Long before we got our decree.

---

## ELYOT:

My heart broke on that damned trip round the world.

---

## ELYOT:

I saw the most beautiful things, darling.

---

## ELYOT:

Moonlight shining on old temples,

---

## ELYOT:

strange dances in jungle villages,

---

## ELYOT:

scarlet flamingoes flying over deep, deep blue water.

---

## ELYOT:

Breathlessly lovely, and completely unexciting

---

## ELYOT:

because you weren’t there to see them with me.

---

## AMANDA:

Take me, take me at once,

---

## AMANDA:

let’s make up for lost time.

---

## ELYOT:

Next week?

---

## AMANDA:

Tomorrow.

---

## ELYOT:

Done.

---

## AMANDA:

I must see those dear flamingoes.

---

## AMANDA:

Eight years all told, we’ve loved each other.

---

## AMANDA:

Three married and five divorced.

---

## ELYOT:

Angel. Angel. Angel.

---

## AMANDA:

No, Elyot, stop now, stop -

---

## ELYOT:

Why should I stop? You know you adore being made love to.

---

## AMANDA:

It’s so soon after dinner.

---

## ELYOT:

You really do say the most awful things.

---

## AMANDA:

I don’t see what's so particularly awful about that.

---

## ELYOT:

No sense of glamor, no sense of glamor at all.

---

## AMANDA:

It’s difficult to feel really glamorous with a crick in one's neck.

---

## ELYOT:

Why didn’t you say you had a crick in your neck?

---

## AMANDA:

It’s gone now.

---

## ELYOT:

How convenient.

---

---

## AMANDA:

I want one please.

---

## ELYOT:

Here.

---

## AMANDA:

Light?

---

## ELYOT:

Wait a minute, can’t you?

---

## AMANDA:

Chivalrous little love.

---

## ELYOT:

Here.

---

## AMANDA:

Thank you very much indeed.

---

## ELYOT:

You really can be more irritating than anyone in the world.

---

## AMANDA:

I fail to see what I’ve done that’s so terribly irritating.

---

## ELYOT:

You have no tact.

---

## AMANDA:

Tact. You have no consideration.

---

## ELYOT:

Too soon after dinner indeed.

---

## AMANDA:

Yes, much too soon.

---

## ELYOT:

That sort of remark shows rather a common sort of mind--

---

## AMANDA:

Oh it does, does it?

---

## ELYOT:

Very unpleasant, makes me shudder.

---

## AMANDA:

Causing all this fuss just because your silly vanity is a little upset.

---

## ELYOT:

Vanity: What do you mean, vanity?

---

## AMANDA:

You can’t bear the thought that there are certain moments

---

## AMANDA:

when our chemical, what d’you call ‘ems, don’t fuse properly.

---

## ELYOT:

Chemical what d’you call ‘ems:

---

## ELYOT:

Please try to be more explicit.

---

## AMANDA:

You know what I mean, don’t try to patronize me.

---

## ELYOT:

Now see here, Amanda -

---

## AMANDA:

Darling, Sollocks! Oh, for God’s sake, Sollocks!

---

## ELYOT:

But -
--

## AMANDA:

Sollocks, Sollock, Oh dear – triple Sollocks!

---

## AMANDA:

Big romantic stuff, darling.

---

## ELYOT:

Yes, big romantic stuff.

[PHONE RINGS]

---

## ELYOT:

Good God!

---

## AMANDA:

Do you think it’s them?

---

## ELYOT:

I wonder.

---

## AMANDA:

Nobody knows we’re here except Freda, and she wouldn’t ring up.

---

## ELYOT:

It must be them then.

---

## AMANDA:

What are we to do?

---

## ELYOT:

We’re all right darling, whatever happens?

---

## AMANDA:

Now and always, Sweet.

---

## ELYOT:

I don’t care then.

---

## AMANDA:

It was bound to happen sooner or later.

---

## ELYOT:

Hallo?

---

## ELYOT:

Hallo?-hallo-what- comment? Madame, qui?

---

## ELYOT:

‘Allo-‘allo-oui c’est ca.

---

## ELYOT:

Oh, Madame Duvallon – Oui, oui, oui.

---

## ELYOT:

It’s only somebody wanting to talk to the dear Madame Duvallon.

---

## AMANDA:

Who’s she?

---

## ELYOT:

I haven’t the faintest idea.

---

## ELYOT:

Je regrette beaucoup, Monsieur, mais Madame Duvallon viens de partir cette après-midi, pour Madagascar.

---

## ELYOT:

Whew; that gave me a fright.

---

## AMANDA:

It sent shivers up my spine.

---

## ELYOT:

What shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us?

---

## AMANDA:

Behave exquisitely.

---

## ELYOT:

With the most perfect poise?

---

## AMANDA:

Certainly, I shall probably do a Court Curtsey.

---

## ELYOT:

Things that ought to matter dreadfully, don’t matter at all when one’s happy, do they?

---

## AMANDA:

What is so horrible is that one can’t stay happy.

---

## ELYOT:

Don’t say that, darling.

---

## AMANDA:

It’s true. The whole business is a very poor joke.

---

## ELYOT:

Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing, Love?

---

## AMANDA:

Yes, meaning just that.

---

## ELYOT:

What does it all mean, that’s what I ask myself in my ceaseless quest for ultimate truth.

---

## ELYOT:

Dear God, what does it all mean?

---

## AMANDA:

Don’t laugh at me, I’m serious.

---

## ELYOT:

You mustn’t be serious, darling; it’s just what they want.

---

## AMANDA:

Who’s they?

---

## ELYOT:

All the futile moralists who try to make life unbearable.

---

## ELYOT:

Laugh at them. Be flippant.

---

## ELYOT:

Laugh at everything, all the sacred shibboleths.

---

## ELYOT:

Laughter brings out the acid in their damned sweetness and light.

---

## AMANDA:

If I laugh at them, I must laugh at us too.

---

## ELYOT:

Certainly you must. We’re figures of fun all right.

---

## AMANDA:

How long will it last,

---

## AMANDA:

this ludicrous, overbearing love of ours?

---

## ELYOT:

Who knows?

---

## AMANDA:

Shall we always want to bicker and fight?

---

## ELYOT:

No, that desire will fade, along with our passion.

---

## AMANDA:

Oh dear, shall we like that?

---

## ELYOT:

It all depends on how well we’ve played.

---

## AMANDA:

What if one of us dies?

---

## AMANDA:

Does the one that’s left still laugh?

---

## ELYOT:

Yes, yes, with all his might.

---

## AMANDA:

That’s serious enough, isn’t it?

---

## ELYOT:

No, no, it isn’t.

---

## ELYOT:

Death’s highly laughable, such a cunning little mystery. All done with mirrors.

---

## AMANDA:

Darling, I believe you’re talking nonsense.

---

## ELYOT:

So is everyone else in the long run.

---

## ELYOT:

Let’s be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.

---

## ELYOT:

Let’s blow trumpets and squeakers, and enjoy the party as long as we can,

---

## ELYOT:

like very small, quite idiotic school children.

---

## ELYOT:

Let’s savor the delight of the moment.

---

## ELYOT:

Oh my darling, kiss me,

---

## ELYOT:

before your body rots, and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.

---

## AMANDA:

Elyot, worms don’t pop.

---

## ELYOT:

I don’t care what you do, see?

---

## ELYOT:

You can paint yourself bright green all over,

---

## ELYOT:

and dance naked in the Place Vendome,

---

## ELYOT:

and dash off madly with all the men in the world,

---

## ELYOT:

and I shan’t say a word, as long as you love me best.

---

## AMANDA:

Thank you, dear. The same applies to you,

---

## AMANDA:

except if I catch you so much as looking at another woman,

---

## AMANDA:

I’ll kill you.

---

---

## ELYOT:

Do you remember that awful scene we had in Venice?

---

## AMANDA:

Which particular one?

---

## ELYOT:

The one when you bought that little painted wooden snake on the Piazza, and put it in my bed.

---

## AMANDA:

Oh, Charles. That was his name, Charles.

---

## AMANDA:

He did wriggle so beautifully.

---

## ELYOT:

Horrible thing, I hated it.

---

## AMANDA:

Yes, I know.

---

## AMANDA:

You threw it out of the window into the Grand Canal.

---

## AMANDA:

I don’t think I’ll ever forgive you for that.

---

## ELYOT:

How long did the row last?

---

## AMANDA:

It went on intermittently for days.

---

## ELYOT:

The worst one was in Cannes

---

## ELYOT:

when your curling iron burnt a hole in my new dressing gown.

---

## AMANDA:

It burnt my comb too, and all the towels in the bathroom.

---

## ELYOT:

That was a rouser, wasn’t it?

---

## AMANDA:

The manager came in and found us rolling on the floor like panthers, oh dear.

---

## ELYOT:

I shall never forget his face.

---

## AMANDA:

How ridiculous, how utterly ridiculous.

---

## ELYOT:

We were very much younger then.

---

## AMANDA:

And very much sillier.

---

## ELYOT:

As a matter of fact the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.

---

## AMANDA:

You knew there was nothing in that.

---

## ELYOT:

I didn’t know anything of the sort, you took presents from him.

---

## AMANDA:

Presents? Only a trivial little brooch.

---

## ELYOT:

I remember it well, bristling with diamonds. In the worst possible taste.

---

## AMANDA:

Not at all, it was very pretty. I still have it, and I wear it often.

---

## ELYOT:

You used to go out of your way to torture me about Peter Burden.

---

## AMANDA:

No, I didn’t, you worked the whole thing up in your jealous imagination.

---

## ELYOT:

You must admit that he was in love with you, wasn’t he?

---

## AMANDA:

Just a little perhaps. Nothing serious.

---

## ELYOT:

You let him kiss you. You said you did.

---

## AMANDA:

Well, what of it?

---

## ELYOT:

What of it!

---

## AMANDA:

It gave him a lot of pleasure, and it didn’t hurt me.

---

## ELYOT:

What about me?

---

## AMANDA:

If you hadn’t been so nosey and suspicious,

---

## AMANDA:

you wouldn't have known a thing about it.

---

## ELYOT:

That’s a nice point of view I must say.

---

## AMANDA:

Oh dear, I’m bored with this conversation.

---

## ELYOT:

So am I, bored stiff.

---

## ELYOT:

Want some brandy?

---

## AMANDA:

No thank you.

---

## ELYOT:

I’ll have a little, I think.

---

## AMANDA:

I don’t see why you want it, you’ve already had two glasses.

---

## ELYOT:

No particular reason, anyhow they were very small ones.

---

## AMANDA:

It seems silly to go on, and on, and on with a thing.

---

## ELYOT:

You can hardly call three liqueur glasses in an evening going on, and on, and on.

---

## AMANDA:

It’s becoming a habit with you.

---

## ELYOT:

You needn’t be so grand, just because you don’t happen to want any yourself at the moment.

---

## AMANDA:

Don’t be stupid.

---

## ELYOT:

Really Amanda -

---

## AMANDA:

What?

---

## ELYOT:

Nothing.

---

---

## ELYOT:

Going out somewhere, dear?

---

## AMANDA:

No, just making myself fascinating for you.

---

## ELYOT:

That reply has broken my heart.

---

## AMANDA:

'Tis the woman’s job to allure the man.

---

## AMANDA:

Watch me a minute.

---

## ELYOT:

As a matter of fact that’s perfectly true.

---

## AMANDA:

Oh, no, it isn’t.

---

## ELYOT:

Yes it is.
--


## AMANDA:

Oh be quiet.

---

## ELYOT:

It’s a shame you don't have some more brandy;

---

## ELYOT:

it might make you a little less disagreeable.

---

## AMANDA:

It doesn’t seem to have worked such wonders with you.

---

## ELYOT:

Snap, snap, snap; like a little adder.

---

## AMANDA:

Adders don’t snap, they sting.

---

## ELYOT:

Nonsense, they have a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap.

---

## AMANDA:

They sting.
--

## ELYOT:

They snap.

---

## AMANDA:

I don’t care, do you hear?

---

## AMANDA:

I don’t mind if they bark, and roll about like hoops.

---

## ELYOT:

Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce.

---

## AMANDA:

Yes, I did, quite a lot.

---

## ELYOT:

I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more then.

---

## AMANDA:

Mind your own business.

---

## ELYOT:

You must have had a riotous time.

---

## ELYOT:

No restraint at all – highly enjoyable.

---

## ELYOT

You never had much anyhow.

---

## AMANDA:

You’re quite insufferable;

---

## AMANDA:

I expect it’s because you’re drunk.

---

## ELYOT:

I’m not in the least drunk.

---

## AMANDA:

You always had a weak head.

---

## ELYOT:

I said before that I have only had three minute liqueur glasses of brandy the whole evening long.

---

## ELYOT:

A child of two couldn’t get drunk on that.

---

## AMANDA:

On the contrary, a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.

---

## ELYOT:

Very interesting. How about a child of four, and a child of six, and a child of nine?

---

## AMANDA:

Oh do shut up.

---

## ELYOT:

We might get up a splendid little debate about that, you know, Intemperate Tots.

---

## AMANDA:

Not very funny, dear; you’d better have some more brandy.

---

## ELYOT:

Very good idea, I will.

---

## AMANDA:

Ridiculous ass.

---

## ELYOT:

I beg your pardon.

---

## AMANDA:

I said ridiculous ass!

---

## ELYOT:

Thank you.

## AMANDA:

There aren’t any people upstairs. It’s a photographer’s studio.

---

## ELYOT:

There are people downstairs, I suppose?

---

## AMANDA:

They’re away in Tunis.

This is no time of year for Tunis.

I’m tired of listening to you, you damned sadistic bully.

Very amusing indeed.

Stop – stop – stop –

You’re a vile tempered, loose-living; wicked little beast,

This is the end, do you hear? Finally and forever.

## ELYOT:

You’re not going like this.

## AMANDA:

Oh, yes I am.

---

## ELYOT:

You’re not.

## AMANDA:

I am; let me go –

You’re a cruel fiend, and I hate and loathe you;

## ELYOT:

Shut up!

Thank God I’ve realized what you’re really like;
--

## ELYOT:

Shut up!

---

## AMANDA:

Marry you again?! I’d rather die in torment -
--

## ELYOT:

I wouldn’t marry you again if you came crawling to me on your bended knees,

---

## ELYOT:

you’re a mean, evil-minded, little vampire –

---

## ELYOT:

I hope to God I never set eyes on you again as long as I live!

C'est le prochain matin.

Il est environ huit heures et demie.

## LOUISE:

Victor et Sibyl ont tiré les deux canapés devant les portes des deux chambres et maintenant ils dorment sur les canapés.

---

## LOUISE:

Victor est devant la porte d'Amanda, et Sibyl est devant celle d'Elyot.

## LOUISE:

La pièce est completement derangée, comme la derniere nuit.

## LOUISE:

Il y a un cliquetis d'une clé dans la serrure de la porte d'entrée, et Louise entre.

---

---

## LOUISE:

Oh!

---

## SIBYL:

Oh dear.

---

## LOUISE:

Bon jour, Madame.

---

## SIBYL:

What? – Oh – bon jour.

---

## LOUISE:

Qu’est-ce que vous faites ici, Madame?

---

## SIBYL:

What – what? – Wait a moment,

---

## SIBYL:

attendez un instant – oh dear –

---

## VICTOR:

What’s happened?

---

## VICTOR:

Of course, I remember now. Oh!

---

## LOUISE:

Bon jour, Monseiur.

---

## VICTOR:

Er – bon jour- What time is it?

---

## LOUISE:

Eh, Monsieur?

---

## SIBYL:

Quelle heure est-il, s’il vous plait?

---

## LOUISE:

C’est neuf heures moins dix, Madame.

---

## VICTOR:

What did she say?

---

## SIBYL:

I think she said nearly ten o’clock.

---

## VICTOR:

Er voulez- er-wake-reveillez Monsieur et Madame – er – toute suite?

---

## LOUISE:

Non, Monsieur.

---

## LOUISE:

Il m’est absolutment defendu de les appeler jusqu’a ce qu’ils sonnent.

---

## SIBYL:

What are we to do?

---

## VICTOR:

Wake them ourselves.

---

## SIBYL:

No, no, wait a minute.

---

## VICTOR:

What’s the matter?

---

## SIBYL:

I couldn’t face them yet,

---

## SIBYL:

really, I couldn’t; I feel dreadful.

---

## VICTOR:

So do I. It’s a lovely morning.

---

## SIBYL:

Lovely.

---

## VICTOR:

I say, don’t cry.

---

## SIBYL:

I can’t help it.

---

## VICTOR:

Please don’t, please -

---

## SIBYL:

It’s all so squalid;

---

## SIBYL:

I wish we hadn’t stayed; what’s the use?

---

## VICTOR:

We’ve got to see them before we go back to England,

---

## VICTOR:

we must get things straightened out.

---

## SIBYL:

Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, I wish I were dead.

---

## VICTOR:

Hush, now, hush. Remember your promise.

---

## VICTOR:

We’ve got to see this through together and get it settled one way or another.

---

## SIBYL:

I’ll try to control myself, only I’m so…so tired,

---

## SIBYL:

I haven’t slept properly for ages.

---

## VICTOR:

Neither have I.

---

## SIBYL:

If we hadn’t arrived when we did...

---

## VICTOR:

They must have been drunk.

---

## SIBYL:

I’d no idea anyone ever behaved like that;

---

## SIBYL:

it’s so disgusting,

---

## SIBYL:

so degrading, Elli of all people – oh dear –

---

## VICTOR:

What an escape you’ve had.

---

## SIBYL:

What an escape we’ve both had.

---

## AMANDA:

Oh! – good morning.

---

## VICTOR:

Oh, Amanda.

---

## AMANDA:

Will you please move this sofa, I can’t get out.

---

## VICTOR:

Where are you going?

---

## AMANDA:

Away.

---

## VICTOR:

You can’t.
--

## AMANDA:

Why?

---

## VICTOR:

I want to talk to you.

---

## AMANDA:

What on earth is the use of that?

---

## VICTOR:

I must talk to you.

---

## AMANDA:

Well, all I can say is, it’s very inconsiderate.

---

## VICTOR:

Mandy, I -

---

## AMANDA:

I suppose you’re Sibyl; how do you do?

---

## AMANDA:

Well, if you’re going to take up that attitude, I fail to see the point of your coming here at all.

---

## SIBYL:

I came to see Elyot.

---

## AMANDA:

I’ve no wish to prevent you;

---

## AMANDA:

he’s in there, probably wallowing in an alcoholic stupor.

---

## VICTOR:

This is all very unpleasant, Amanda.

---

## AMANDA:

I quite agree, that’s why I want to go away.

---

## VICTOR:

That would be shirking; this must be discussed at length.

---

## AMANDA:

Very well, if you insist,

---

## AMANDA:

but not just now, I don’t feel up to it.

---

## AMANDA:

Has Louise come yet?

---

## VICTOR:

If Louise is the maid, she’s in the kitchen.

---

## AMANDA:

Thank you.

---

## AMANDA:

You probably want some coffee, excuse me a moment.

---

## SIBYL:

Well! How dare she?

---

## VICTOR:

How dare she what?

---

## SIBYL:

Behave so calmly, as though nothing had happened.

---

## VICTOR:

I don’t see what else she could have done.

---

## SIBYL:

Insufferable I call it.

---

## ELYOT:

Oh God.

---

## SIBYL:

Elyot – Elyot –Elyot – Elyot –Elyot -
--

## ELYOT:

Go away.

---

## SIBYL:

Oh, oh, oh.

---

## VICTOR:

Do pull yourself together for heaven’s sake.

---

## SIBYL:

I can’t, I can’t, I can't –

---

## AMANDA:

I’ve ordered some coffee and rolls, they’ll be here soon.

---

## AMANDA:

I must apologize for the room being so untidy.

---

## VICTOR:

It’s no use crying like that, it doesn’t do any good.

---

## SIBYL:

Elyot, where are you going?

---

## ELYOT:

Canada.

---

## SIBYL:

You can’t go like this, you can’t.

---

## ELYOT:

I see no point in staying.

---

## VICTOR:

You owe it to Sibyl to stay.

---

## ELYOT:

How do you do, I don’t think we’ve met before.

---

## SIBYL:

You must stay, you’ve got to stay.

---

## ELYOT:

Very well, if you insist. I’m afraid the room is rather a mess.

---

## ELYOT:

Have you seen the maid Louise?

---

## VICTOR:

In the kitchen.

---

## ELYOT:

Good. I’ll order some coffee.

---

## VICTOR:

No, your – er- my – er – Amanda has already ordered it.

---

## ELYOT:

Oh, I’m glad the old girl’s up and about.

---

## VICTOR:

We’ve got to get things straightened out, you know.

---

## ELYOT:

Yes, it’s pretty awful.

---

## ELYOT:

We’ll call the concierge from downstairs.

---

## VICTOR:

You’re being purposely flippant, but it’s no good.

---

## ELYOT:

Sorry.

---

## VICTOR:

What’s to be done?

---

## ELYOT:

I don’t know.

---

## SIBYL:

It’s all perfectly horrible.

---

## SIBYL:

I feel smirched and unclean as though slimy things had been crawling all over me.

---

## ELYOT:

Maybe they have; that’s a very old sofa.

---

## VICTOR:

If you don’t stop your damned flippancy,

---

## VICTOR:

I’ll knock your head off.

---

## ELYOT:

Has it ever struck you

---

## ELYOT:

that flippancy might cover a very real embarrassment?

---

## VICTOR:

In a situation such as this, it’s in extremely bad taste.

---

## ELYOT:

No worse than bluster and invective.

---

## ELYOT:

As a matter of fact, as far as I know,

---

## ELYOT:

this situation is entirely without precedent.

---

## ELYOT:

We don't have any prescribed etiquette to fall back on.

---

## ELYOT:

I shall continue to be flippant.

---

## SIBYL:

Oh, Elyot, how can you – how can you.

---

## VICTOR:

I’m awfully sorry, Sibyl.

---

## VICTOR:

It’s easy enough to be sorry.

---

## ELYOT:

On the contrary. I find it exceedingly difficult.

---

## ELYOT:

I seldom regret anything.

---

## ELYOT:

This is a very rare and notable exception, a sort of red letter day.

---

## ELYOT:

We must all make the most of it.

---

## SIBYL:

I’ll never forgive you, never.

---

## SIBYL:

I wouldn’t have believed anyone could be so callous and cruel.

---

## ELYOT:

I absolutely see your point,

---

## ELYOT:

and as I said before, I’m sorry.

---

---

## AMANDA:

What! Breakfast not ready yet?

---

## AMANDA:

Really, these French servants are too slow for words.

---

## AMANDA:

What a glorious day.

---

## AMANDA:

I do love Paris, it’s so genuinely gay.

---

## AMANDA:

Those lovely trees in the Champs Elysees,

---

## AMANDA:

and the little roundabouts for the children to play on,

---

## AMANDA:

and those shiny red taxis.

---

## AMANDA:

Oh look! You can see Sacre Coeur quite clearly today;

---

## AMANDA:

sometimes it’s a bit misty, particularly in August,

---

## AMANDA:

all the heat rising up from the pavement you know.

---

## ELYOT:

Yes, dear, we know.

---

## AMANDA:

And it’s lovely being so high up.

---

## AMANDA:

I found this flat three years ago, quite by merest chance.

---

## AMANDA:

I was staying at the Plaza Athenee, just down the road--

---

## ELYOT:

Such a nice little hotel, with an enchanting courtyard with a fountain that goes

---

## ELYOT:

plopplopplopplopplopplopplopplopplop–

---

## VICTOR:

This is ridiculous Amanda.

---

## AMANDA:

Now, Victor, I refuse to discuss anything in the least important until after breakfast.

---

## ELYOT:

Plopplpplopplopplopplopp--
--

## AMANDA:

I couldn’t concentrate now, I know I couldn’t.

---

## ELYOT:

What manner. What poise. How I envy it.

---

## ELYOT:

To be able to carry off the most embarrassing situation

---

## ELYOT:

with such tact, and delicacy,

---

## ELYOT:

and above all – such subtlety.

---

## ELYOT:

Go on Amanda,

---

## ELYOT:

you’re making everything so much easier.

---

## ELYOT:

We shall be playing charades in a minute.

---

## AMANDA:

Please don’t address me,

---

## AMANDA:

I don’t wish to speak to you.

---

## ELYOT:

Splendid.

---

## AMANDA:

And what’s more, I never shall again as long as I live.

---

## ELYOT:

I shall endeavor to rise above it.

---

## AMANDA:

You’re an unmitigated cad, and a bully.

---

## ELYOT:

And you’re an ill-mannered, bad-tempered slattern.

---

## AMANDA:

Slattern, indeed.

---

## ELYOT:

Yes, slattern, slattern, slattern, and fishwife.

---

## VICTOR:

Keep your mouth shut, you swine.

---

## ELYOT:

Mind your own damned business.

---

## SIBYL:

Stop, stop, it’s no use going on like this.

---

## SIBYL:

Stop, please. Help me, do, do, do, help me -

---

## AMANDA:

I’m not going to interfere. Let them fight if they want to;

---

## AMANDA:

it will probably clear the air anyhow.

---

## SIBYL:

Yes, but –

---

## AMANDA:

Come into my room; perhaps you’d like to wash or something.

---

## SIBYL:

No, but –

---

## AMANDA:

Come along.

---

## SIBYL:

Very well.

---

## VICTOR:

Now then!

---

## ELYOT:

Now then what?

---

## VICTOR:

Are you going to take back those things you said to Amanda?

---

## ELYOT:

I’ll take back anything you like, only stop bellowing at me.

---

## VICTOR:

You’re a coward too.

---

## ELYOT:

They want us to fight, don’t you see?

---

## VICTOR:

No, I don’t, why should they?

---

## ELYOT:

Primitive feminine instincts – warring males – very enjoyable.

---

## VICTOR:

You think you’re very clever, don’t you?

---

## ELYOT:

I think I’m a bit cleverer than you, but apparently that’s not saying much.

---

## VICTOR:

What?

---

## ELYOT:

Oh, do sit down.

---

## VICTOR:

I will not.

---

## ELYOT:

I will; I’m extremely tired.

---

## VICTOR:

Oh, for God’s sake, behave like a man.

---

## ELYOT:

All this belligerency is very right and proper and highly traditional,

---

## ELYOT:

but if only you’ll think for a moment, you’ll see that it won’t do us any good.

---

## VICTOR:

To hell with all that.

---

## ELYOT:

I should like to explain that if you hit me, I shall certainly hit you,

---

## ELYOT:

probably equally hard, if not harder.

---

## ELYOT:

I’m just as strong as you, I should imagine.

---

## ELYOT:

Then you’d hit me again, and I’d hit you again,

---

## ELYOT:

and we’d go on until one or the other was knocked out.

---

## ELYOT:

Now if you can explain to me satisfactorily how all that can possibly improve the situation,

---

## ELYOT:

I'll tear off my coat and we’ll go at one another hammer and tongs, immediately.

---

## VICTOR:

It would ease my mind.

---

## ELYOT:

Only if you won.

---

## VICTOR:

I should win all right.

---

## ELYOT:

Want to try?

---

## VICTOR:

Yes.

---

## ELYOT:

Here goes then –

---

## VICTOR:

Just a moment.

---

## ELYOT:

Well?

---

## VICTOR:

What did you mean about them wanting us to fight?

---

## ELYOT:

It would be balm to their vanity.

---

## VICTOR:

Do you love Amanda?

---

## ELYOT:

Is this a battle or a discussion?

---

## ELYOT:

If it’s the latter I shall put on my coat again; I don’t want to catch a chill.

---

## VICTOR:

Answer my question, please.

---

## ELYOT:

Have a cigarette?
--

## VICTOR:

Answer my question.

---

## ELYOT:

If you analyze it, it’s rather a silly question.

---

## VICTOR:

Do you love Amanda?
--

## ELYOT:

No.

---

## ELYOT:

Do you love her?

---

## VICTOR:

That’s beside the point.

---

## ELYOT:

On the contrary, it’s the crux of the whole affair.

---

## ELYOT:

If you do love her still, you can forgive her,

---

## ELYOT:

and live with her in peace and harmony until you’re ninety-eight.

---

## VICTOR:

You’re apparently even more of a cad than I thought you were.

---

## ELYOT:

You’re completely in the right over the whole business,

---

## ELYOT:

don’t imagine I’m not perfectly conscious of that.

---

## VICTOR:

I’m glad.

---

## ELYOT:

It’s all very unfortunate.

---

## VICTOR:

Unfortunate: My God!

---

## ELYOT:

It might have been worse.

---

## VICTOR:

I’m glad you think so.

---

## ELYOT:

I do wish you’d stop being so glad about everything.

---

## VICTOR:

What do you intend to do?

---

## VICTOR:

That’s what I want to know.

---

## VICTOR:

What do you intend to do?

---

## ELYOT:

I don’t know, I don’t care.

---

## VICTOR:

I suppose you realize that you’ve broken that poor little woman’s heart?

---

## ELYOT:

Which poor little woman?

---

## VICTOR:

Sibyl, of course.

---

## ELYOT:

Oh, come now, not as bad as that.

---

## ELYOT:

She’ll get over it, and forget all about me.

---

## VICTOR:

I sincerely hope so…for her sake.

---

## ELYOT:

Amanda will forget all about me too. Everybody will forget all about me.

---

## ELYOT:

I might just as well lie down and die in fearful pain and suffering, nobody would care.

---

## VICTOR:

Don’t talk such rot.

---

## ELYOT:

You must forgive me for taking rather a gloomy view of everything

---

## ELYOT:

but the fact is, I suddenly feel slightly depressed.

---

## VICTOR:

I intended to divorce Amanda, naming you as co-respondent.

---

## ELYOT:

Very well.
--

## VICTOR:

And Sibyl will divorce you for Amanda.

---

## VICTOR:

It would be foolish of either of you to attempt any defense.

---

## ELYOT:

Quite.
--

## VICTOR:

And the sooner you marry Amanda again, the better.

---

## ELYOT:

I’m not going to marry Amanda.

---

## VICTOR:

What?

---

## ELYOT:

She’s a vile-tempered, wicked woman.

---

## VICTOR:

You should have thought of that before.

---

## ELYOT:

I did think of it before.

---

## VICTOR:

You’ve got to marry her.

---

## ELYOT:

I’d rather marry a ravening leopard.

---

## VICTOR:

Now look here. I’m sick of all this shilly-shallying.

---

## VICTOR:

You’re getting off a good deal more lightly than you deserve

---

## VICTOR:

you can consider yourself damned lucky I didn’t shoot you.

---

## ELYOT:

Well, if you’d had a spark of manliness in you, you would have shot me.

---

## ELYOT:

You’re all fuss and fume, one of those cotton wool Englishmen.

---

## ELYOT:

I despise you.

---

## VICTOR:

You despise me?

---

## ELYOT:

Yes, utterly.

---

## ELYOT:

You’re nothing but a rampaging gas bag!

---

---

## AMANDA:

Well, what’s happened?

---

## VICTOR:

Nothing’s happened.

---

## AMANDA:

You ought to be ashamed to admit it.

---

## SIBYL:

Where’s Elyot?

---

## VICTOR:

In there.
--

## AMANDA:

What’s he doing?

---

## VICTOR:

How do I know what he’s doing?

---

## AMANDA:

If you were half the man I thought you were, he’d be bandaging himself.

---

## SIBYL:

Elyot’s just as strong as Victor.

---

## AMANDA:

I should like it proved.

---

## SIBYL:

There’s no need to be so vindictive.

---

## AMANDA:

You were abusing Elyot like a pickpocket to me a moment ago,

---

## AMANDA:

now you are defending him.

---

## SIBYL:

I’m beginning to suspect that he wasn’t quite so much to blame as I thought.

---

## AMANDA:

Oh, really?

---

## SIBYL:

You certainly have a very unpleasant temper.

---

## AMANDA:

It’s a little difficult to keep up with your rapid changes of front,

---

## AMANDA:

but you’re young and inexperienced,

---

## AMANDA:

so I forgive you freely.

---

## SIBYL:

Seeing the depths of degradation to which age and experience have brought you,

---

## SIBYL:

I’m glad I’m as I am!

---

## AMANDA:

That was exceedingly rude,

---

## AMANDA:

I think perhaps you’d better go away somewhere.

---

## SIBYL:

After all, Elyot is my husband.

---

## AMANDA:

By all means, take him with you.

---

## SIBYL:

If you’re not very careful, I will!

---

## SIBYL:

Elyot, let me in.

---

## AMANDA:

Heaven preserve me from nice women!

---

## SIBYL:

Your own reputation ought to do that.

---

## AMANDA:

Oh, go to hell!

---

## AMANDA:

Victor.

---

## VICTOR:

What?

---

## AMANDA:

Nothing.

---

---

## VICTOR:

Where does it go?

---

## AMANDA:

Over there.

---

## AMANDA:

Thank you, Victor.

---

## VICTOR:

Don’t mention it.

---

## AMANDA:

What did you say to Elyot.

---

## VICTOR:

I told him he was beneath contempt.

---

## AMANDA:

Good.

---

## VICTOR:

I think you must be mad, Amanda.

---

## AMANDA:

I’ve often thought that myself.

---

## VICTOR:

I feel completely lost, completely bewildered.

---

## AMANDA:

I don’t blame you. I don’t feel any too cozy myself.

---

## VICTOR:

Had you been drinking last night?

---

## AMANDA:

Certainly not!

---

## VICTOR:

Had Elyot been drinking?

---

## AMANDA:

Yes – gallons.

---

## VICTOR:

Used he to drink before? When you were married to him?

---

## AMANDA:

Yes, terribly.

---

## AMANDA:

Every night he’d come home roaring and hiccoughing.

---

## VICTOR:

Disgusting!

---

## AMANDA:

Victor, I’m most awfully sorry to have given you so much trouble, really I am.

---

## AMANDA:

I behaved terribly, but something happened to me.

---

## AMANDA:

I can’t explain it, there’s no excuse,

---

## AMANDA:

but I am ashamed of having made you unhappy.

---

## VICTOR:

I can’t understand it at all.

---

## VICTOR:

I’ve tried to, but I can’t. It all seems so unlike you.

---

## AMANDA:

It isn’t really unlike me, that’s the trouble.

---

## AMANDA:

You ought never to have married me; I’m a bad lot.

---

## VICTOR:

Amanda!

---

## AMANDA:

Don’t contradict me. I know I’m a bad lot.

---

## VICTOR:

I wasn’t going to contradict you.

---

## AMANDA:

Victor!

---

## VICTOR:

You appall me – absolutely!

---

## AMANDA:

Go on, go on, I deserve it.

---

## VICTOR:

I didn’t come here to accuse you; there’s no sense in that!

---

## AMANDA:

Why did you come?

---

## VICTOR:

To find out what you want me to do.

---

## AMANDA:

Divorce me, I suppose, as soon as possible.

---

## AMANDA:

I won’t make any trouble.

---

## AMANDA:

I’ll go away somewhere, far away,

---

## AMANDA:

Morocco, or Tunis.

---

## AMANDA:

I shall probably catch some dreadful disease, and die out there, all alone – oh dear!

---

## VICTOR:

It’s no use pitying yourself.

---

## AMANDA:

I seem to be the only one who does. I might just as well enjoy it.

---

## AMANDA:

I’m thoroughly unprincipled; Sibyl was right!

---

## VICTOR:

Sibyl’s an ass.

---

## AMANDA:

Yes, she rather is, isn’t she?

---

## AMANDA:

I can’t think why Elyot ever married her.

---

## VICTOR:

Do you love him?

---

## AMANDA:

She seems so insipid, somehow -
--

## VICTOR:

Do you love him?

---

## AMANDA:

Of course she’s very pretty, I suppose, in a rather a shallow way, but-
--

## VICTOR:

Amanda!

---

## AMANDA:

Yes, Victor?

---

## VICTOR:

You haven’t answered my question.

---

## AMANDA:

I’ve forgotten what it was.

---

## VICTOR:

You’re hopeless – hopeless.

---

## AMANDA:

Don’t be angry,

---

## AMANDA:

it’s all much too serious to be angry about.

---

## VICTOR:

You’re talking utter nonsense!

---

## AMANDA:

No, I’m not.

---

## AMANDA:

It’s ridiculous for us all to stand round here arguing with each other.

---

## AMANDA:

You’d much better go back to England and let you lawyers deal with the whole thing.

---

## VICTOR:

But what about you?

---

## AMANDA:

I’ll be alright.

---

## VICTOR:

I only want to know one thing, and you won’t tell me.

---

## AMANDA:

What is it?

---

## VICTOR:

Do you love Elyot?

---

## AMANDA:

No, I hate him.

---

## AMANDA:

When I saw him again at Deauville, it was an odd sort of shock.

---

## AMANDA:

It swept me away completely. He attracted me;

---

## AMANDA:

he always has attracted me,

---

## AMANDA:

but only the worst part of me. I see that now.

---

## VICTOR:

I can’t understand why? He’s so terribly trivial and superficial.

---

## AMANDA:

That sort of attraction can’t be explained, it’s sort of a chemical what d’you call ‘em.

---

## VICTOR:

Yes; it must be!

---

## AMANDA:

I don’t expect you to understand,

---

## AMANDA:

and I’m not going to try and excuse myself in any way.

---

## AMANDA:

Elyot was the first love affair of my life,

---

## AMANDA:

and in spite of all the suffering he caused me before,

---

## AMANDA:

there must have been a little spark left smoldering,

---

## AMANDA:

which burst into flame when I came face to face with him again.

---

## AMANDA:

I completely lost grip of myself and behaved like a fool,

---

## AMANDA:

for which I shall pay all right, you needn’t worry about that.

---

## AMANDA:

But perhaps one day,

---

## AMANDA:

when all this is dead and done with,

---

## AMANDA:

you and I might meet and be friends.

---

## AMANDA:

That’s something to hope for, anyway.

---

## AMANDA:

Good-bye.

---

---

## VICTOR:

Do you want to marry him?

---

## AMANDA:

I’d rather marry a boa constrictor.

---

## VICTOR:

I can’t go away and leave you with a man who drinks like that.

---

## AMANDA:

You needn’t worry about leaving me, as though I were a sort of parcel.

---

## AMANDA:

I can look after myself.

---

## VICTOR:

You said just now you were going to Tunis to die.

---

## AMANDA:

I’ve changed my mind,

---

## AMANDA:

it is the wrong time of year for Tunis.

---

## AMANDA:

I will go somewhere else.

---

## AMANDA:

I hear Brioni is very nice this time of year.

---

## VICTOR:

Why won’t you be serious for just one moment?

---

## AMANDA:

I’ve told you, there is no use.

---

## VICTOR:

If it will make things any easier for you,

---

## VICTOR:

I won’t divorce you.

---

## AMANDA:

Victor!

---

## VICTOR:

We can live apart until Sibyl has got her decree against Elyot,

---

## VICTOR:

then, some time after that,

---

## VICTOR:

I’ll let you divorce me.

---

## AMANDA:

I see you’re determined to make me serious,

---

## AMANDA:

whether I like it or not.

---

## VICTOR:

I married you because I loved you.

---

## AMANDA:

Oh please, Victor, don't! I won’t listen!

---

## VICTOR:

I expect I love you still;

---

## VICTOR:

one doesn’t change all in a minute.

---

## VICTOR:

You never loved me. I see that now, of course,

---

## VICTOR:

so perhaps everything has turned out for the best really.

---

## AMANDA:

I thought I loved you, really I did.

---

## VICTOR:

Yes, I know, that’s all right.

---

## AMANDA:

What an escape you’ve had.

---

## VICTOR:

I’ve said that to myself often during the last few days.

---

## AMANDA:

There’s no need to rub it in.

---

## VICTOR:

Do you agree about the divorce business?

---

## AMANDA:

Yes. It’s very, very generous of you.

---

## VICTOR:

It will save you some of the mud-slinging.

---

## VICTOR:

We might persuade Sibyl not to name you.

---

## AMANDA:

Yes, we might.

---

## VICTOR:

Perhaps she’ll change her mind about divorcing him.

---

## AMANDA:

Perhaps.

---

## AMANDA:

She certainly went into the bedroom with a predatory look in her eye.

---

## VICTOR:

Would you be pleased if that happened?

---

## AMANDA:

Delighted.

---

## SIBYL:

Elyot and I have come to a decision.

---

## AMANDA:

How very nice!
--

## VICTOR:

What is it?

---

## AMANDA:

Don’t be silly, Victor. Look at their faces.

---

## ELYOT:

Feminine intuition, very difficult.

---

## AMANDA:

Feminine determination, very praiseworthy.

---

## SIBYL:

I am not going to divorce Elyot for a year.

---

## AMANDA:

I congratulate you.

---

## ELYOT:

Sibyl has behaved like an angel.

---

## AMANDA:

Well, it was certainly her big moment.

---

---

## ELYOT :

Il faut le mettre sur la petite table la bas.

---

## LOUISE:

Oui, monsieur.

---

## AMANDA:

It all seems very amicable.

---

## SIBYL:

It is, thank you.

---

## AMANDA:

I don’t wish to depress you, but Victor isn’t going to divorce me either.

---

## ELYOT:

What!

---

## AMANDA:

I believe I asked you once before this morning, never to speak to me again.

---

## ELYOT:

I only said “What.”

---

## ELYOT:

It was a general exclamation denoting extreme satisfaction.

---

## AMANDA:

Do sit down.

---

## SIBYL:

I’m afraid I must be going now.

---

## SIBYL:

I’m catching the Golden Arrow; it leaves at twelve.

---

## ELYOT:

You can stay for some coffee surely?

---

## SIBYL:

No, I really must go!

---

## ELYOT:

I shan’t be seeing you again for such a long time.

---

## AMANDA:

Living apart? How wise!

---

## ELYOT:

Please, Sibyl, do stay!

---

## SIBYL:

Very well, just for a little.

---

## AMANDA:

Victor, sit down, dear.

---

## AMANDA:

Half and half?

---

## SIBYL:

Yes, please.

---

## AMANDA:

What would one do without one’s morning coffee?

---

## AMANDA:

That’s what I often ask myself.

---

## ELYOT:

Is it?

---

## AMANDA:

Victor, sugar for Sibyl.

---

## AMANDA:

It should be absurd for me to call you anything but Sibyl, wouldn’t it?

---

## SIBYL:

Of course; I shall call you Mandy.

---

## ELYOT:

Oh God! We’re off again. What weather!

---

## SIBYL:

Thank you.

---

## VICTOR:

What’s the time?

---

## ELYOT:

If my watch is still going after last night, it’s ten-fifteen.

---

## AMANDA:

Here, Victor dear.

---

## VICTOR:

Thanks.

---

## AMANDA:

Sibyl, sugar for Victor.

---

## ELYOT:

I should like some coffee, please.

---

## AMANDA:

Brioche?

---

## VICTOR:

What?

---

## AMANDA:

Would you like a brioche?

---

## VICTOR:

No, thank you.

---

## ELYOT:

I would. And some butter, and some jam.

---

## AMANDA:

Have you ever been to Brioni?

---

## SIBYL:

No. It’s in the Adriatic, isn’t it?

---

## VICTOR:

The Baltic, I think.

---

## SIBYL:

I made sure it was in the Adriatic.

---

## AMANDA:

I had an aunt who went there once.

---

## ELYOT:

I once had an aunt who went to Tasmania.

---

---

## VICTOR:

Funny how the South of France has become so fashionable in the summer, isn’t it?

---

## SIBYL:

Yes, awfully funny.

---

## ELYOT:

I’ve been laughing about it for months.

---

## AMANDA:

Personally, I think it’s a bit too hot,

---

## AMANDA:

although of course one can lie in the water all day.

---

## SIBYL:

Yes, the bathing is really divine!

---

## VICTOR:

A friend of mine has a house right on the edge of Cape Ferrat.

---

## SIBYL:

Really?

---

## VICTOR:

Yes, right on the edge.

---

## AMANDA:

That sounds marvelous!

---

## VICTOR:

Yes, he seems to like it very much.

---

## AMANDA:

Do you know, I really think I love traveling more than anything else in the world!

---

## AMANDA:

It always gives such a grand feeling of adventure.

---

## AMANDA:

First the thrill of packing,

---

## AMANDA:

and getting your passport visa’d,

---

## AMANDA:

then the thrill of setting off,

---

## AMANDA:

and trundling along on trains and ships,

---

## AMANDA:

and then the most thrilling thing of all,

---

## AMANDA:

arriving at strange places, and meeting strange people, and eating strange foods -

---

## ELYOT:

And making strange noises afterwards.

---

## VICTOR:

That was a damned fool thing to do.

---

## ELYOT:

How did I know that she was going to choke?

---

## VICTOR:

Here, drink some coffee.

---

## AMANDA:

Leave me alone. I’ll be all right in a minute.

---

## VICTOR:

You waste too much time trying to be funny.

---

## SIBYL:

It’s no use talking to Elyot like that;

---

## SIBYL:

it wasn’t his fault.

---

## VICTOR:

Of course it was his fault entirely, making rotten stupid jokes –

---

## SIBYL:

I thought what Elyot said was funny.

---

## VICTOR:

Well, all I can say is, you must have a very warped sense of humor.

---

## SIBYL:

That’s better than having none at all.

---

## VICTOR:

I fail to see what humor there is in incessant trivial flippancy.

---

## SIBYL:

You couldn’t be flippant if you tried until you were blue in the face.

---

## VICTOR:

I shouldn’t dream of trying.

---

## SIBYL:

It must be very sad not to be able to see any fun in anything.

---

## VICTOR:

Fun! I should like you to tell me what fun there is in-

---

## SIBYL:

I pity you, I really do. I’ve been pitying you ever since we left Deauville.

---

## VICTOR:

I’m sure it’s very nice of you, but quite unnecessary.
--

## SIBYL:

And I pity you more than ever now.

---

## VICTOR:

Why now particularly?

---

## SIBYL:

If you don’t see why, I’m certainly not going to tell you.

---

## VICTOR:

I see no reason for you to try and pick a quarrel with me.

---

## VICTOR:

I’ve tried my best to be pleasant to you, and comfort you.

---

## SIBYL:

You weren’t very comforting when I lost my trunk.

---

## VICTOR:

I have little patience with people who go about losing luggage.

---

## SIBYL:

I don’t go about losing luggage.

---

## SIBYL:

It’s the first time I’ve lost anything in my life.

---

## VICTOR:

I find that hard to believe.

---

## SIBYL:

Anyhow, if you’d tipped the porter enough, everything would have been all right.

---

## SIBYL:

Small economies never pay; it’s absolutely no use –

---

## VICTOR:

Oh, for God’s sake be quiet!

---

## SIBYL:

How dare you speak to me like that!

---

## VICTOR:

Because you’ve been irritating me for days.

---

## SIBYL:

Oh!

---

## VICTOR:

You’re one of the most completely idiotic women I’ve ever met.

---

## SIBYL:

And you’re certainly the rudest man I’ve ever met!

---

## VICTOR:

Well then, we’re quits, aren’t we?

---

## SIBYL:

One thing, you’ll get your deserts all right.

---

## VICTOR:

What do you mean by that?

---

## SIBYL:

You know perfectly well what I mean.

---

## SIBYL:

And it’ll serve you right for being weak-minded enough to allow that woman to get round you so easily.

---

## VICTOR:

What about you? Letting that unprincipled roué persuade you to take him back again!

---

## SIBYL:

He’s nothing of the sort,

---

## SIBYL:

he’s just been victimized, as you were victimized.

---

## VICTOR:

Victimized! What damned nonsense!

---

## SIBYL:

It isn’t damned nonsense!

---

## SIBYL:

You’re very fond of searing and blustering and threatening,

---

## SIBYL:

but when it comes to the point you’re as weak as water.

---

## SIBYL:

Why, a blind cat could see what you’ve let yourself in for.

---

## VICTOR:

Stop making those insinuations.

---

## SIBYL:

I’m not insinuating anything.

---

## SIBYL:

When I think of all the things you said about her,

---

## SIBYL:

it makes me laugh, it does really;

---

## SIBYL:

to see how completely she’s got you again.

---

## VICTOR:

You can obviously speak with great authority,

---

## VICTOR:

having had the intelligence to marry a drunkard.

---

## SIBYL:

So that’s what she’s been telling you. I might have known it!

---

## VICTOR:

Yes, she did, and I’m quite sure it’s perfectly true.

---

## SIBYL:

I expect she omitted to tell you that she drank fourteen glasses of brandy last night straight off;

---

## SIBYL:

and the reason their first marriage was broken up

---

## SIBYL:

was that she used to come home at all hours of the night, screaming and hiccoughing.

---

## VICTOR:

If he told you that, he’s a filthy liar.

---

## SIBYL:

He isn’t – he isn’t!

---

## VICTOR:

And if you believe it, you’re a scatterbrained little fool.

---

## SIBYL:

How dare you speak to me like that!

---

## SIBYL:

I've never been so insulted in my life!

---

## SIBYL:

How dare you!

---

## VICTOR:

It’s a tremendous relief to me to have an excuse to insult you.

---

## VICTOR:

I’ve had to listen to your weeping and wailing for days.

---

## VICTOR:

You’ve clacked at me, and sniveled at me until you’ve nearly driven me insane,

---

## VICTOR:

and I controlled my nerves and continued to try and help you because I was sorry for you.

---

## VICTOR:

I always thought you were stupid from the first,

---

## VICTOR:

but I must say

---

## VICTOR:

I never realized that you were a malicious little vixen as well!

---

## SIBYL:

Stop it! Stop it! You insufferable great brute!
