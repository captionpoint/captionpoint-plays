## MESMER:
(in a thick German accent)
You are warm; feel the heat!

---

## FRENCHPERSON:
OH, oh, oh!

---

## MESMER:
You are cold; feel the chill! 

---

## FRENCHPERSON:
OH, oh, oh! 

---

## MESMER:
Light as a feather! 

---

## FRENCHPEOPLE:
Oh! Oh! Oh!

---

## MESMER:
Pain is... gone! 

---

## FRENCHPEOPLE:
Merci, merci, my leg feels better!

---

## MESMER:
Now. You are warm! 

---

You are cold! 

---

You are light as a feather!

(echoing)
Mesmer is gone!

## SARAH:
SONNY LET’S MOOOO TEENERS-- 

---

[ELECTRICAL BUZZING]
## BEN:
Ack.

---

## SARAH:
SONNY LET’S MOOO TEENERS... 

## BEN:
Ackkk!! 

---

## SARAH:
Ding! Deng! Dong! Ding! Deng! Dong! 

## BEN:
Ack! Ack! Ack!

---

## BEN:
Land sakes alive! 

---

## SARAH:
What is the matter, Uncle Ben!? 

---

## BEN:
So many things. What language is that?

---

## SARAH:
French. 

---

## BEN:
A miserable failure. 

---

## SARAH:
Uncle?! 

---

## BEN:
Not your French... Although it could use some improvement.

---

This... this... experiment! It simply did not work!  Where is my notebook?. 

---

(to the tune of Frere Jacques)
Where's my notebook, where's my notebook?

---

[ELECTRICAL BUZZING]

---

Sarah! What on earth are you doing?! 

---

## SARAH:
The experiment is a miserable failure. Don’t you want it gone from sight? 

---

## BEN:
Oh, youth. In such a hurry to get things right. 

---

## SARAH:
I-- I don’t understand. Isn’t it a mistake?

---

## BEN:
Certainly, a mistake. 

---

## SARAH:
A really big mistake?

---

## BEN:
Yes. But it is also a set of clues. A chance to gain some knowledge. 

---

## SARAH:
Mistakes are annoying.

---

## BEN:
Mistakes are essential! How am I going to learn anything, if I am not learning anything? 

---

## SARAH:
That does make a bit of sense. 

---

## BEN:
When I have a problem,

---

[DING]

---

## BEN
I observe and ask a question; then I make a hypothesis. 

---

## SARAH:
A what? 

---

## BEN:
A sort of educated guess-- a prediction, based on the clues-- as to what is going on. 

---

Then comes the fun part: the experiment. Sometimes it goes as expected. 

---

## SARAH:
And sometimes it does not. 

---

## BEN:
I think we’ve established that, thank you. Even still, we have some results, or data, 

---

which can be analyzed and recorded to arrive at... a conclusion. 

---

## SARAH:
A conclusion? Like an end? 

---

## BEN:
An end-- and also a beginning. 

---

## SARAH:
The end is the beginning? That’s confusing. 

---

## BEN:
Think of experimenting not as a line. But as a circle. 

---

## SARAH:
The beginning leads to the end... and then back to the beginning! I get it! 

---

But it’s hard to keep it going.

---

## BEN:
You’ll have to keep practicing. 

[CLOCK CHIMES] 

---

## BEN:
Snap, Crackle and Pop! Time to leave already?! 

---

## SARAH:
Where are you off to, Uncle Ben?

---

## BEN:
Oh......

---

France. 

---

## SARAH:
FRANCE!??!!! Theee France?! Like, France - Europe France??? 

---

## BEN: 
That’s the one... 

---

## WOMAN OFFSTAGE:
Sarah!! 

---

## SARAH:
Oh, Uncle Ben! Take me to France! 

---

## BEN:
Ah ha! Your mother calls. 

---

## MOTHER:
Time for your French lessons! 

---

## SARAH:
Oh la la! Will you see the latest fashions? 

---

## BEN:
No, no. Nothing like that. 

---

## MOTHER:
Sarah! 

---

## BEN:
Off you go! 

---

## SARAH:
What better way to learn French than in France? 

---

## BEN:
This is not the moment to accompany me. Paris is in a bit of a frenzy. 

---

## SARAH:
A frenzy? My favorite! Tell me more!

---

## BEN:
It’s all because of a...... 

---

[MYSTERIOUS HUM]

Doctor Mesmer. 

---

## SARAH:
Doctor Mesmer? 

---

## BEN:
A supposed healer of some sort. The King of France has requested my help... 

---

(in a French accent)
“Ben Franklin will solve it... Ben Franklin knows everything... Why not send for Ben?” 

---

Because... 

---

Ben. Is. Exhausted. 

---

And I’ve got gout! But! The King needs my help. 

---

And I need his. 

---

## SARAH:
SO. MANY. QUESTIONS. First: Why do you need the King’s help? 

---

Second: What is gout? 

---

Third-- and, I just thought of this one-- 

---

WILL YOU TAKE ME TO FRANCE?!?!

---

## BEN:
First: I need to ask the King to support the American revolution-- in short, we must have more money. 

---

Second: Gout is a complex disease arising from a build-up of uric acid in the body. 

---

It takes hold of the big toe and awakens the sufferer from slumber with the feeling that his toe... 

---

...is on fire! 

---

## SARAH:
And... the third question... about taking me to France? 

---

## BEN:
That’s a hard no. 

---

## SARAH:
UGH!! 

---

## SARAH:
Pleeeeeeease! Please please please-

---

## BEN:
Sarah, really. You are too young. And too... 

---

## SARAH:
Too... not a boy? 

---

## BEN:
Something like that. 

---

## SARAH:
But that’s so unfair. 

---

## BEN:
Yes. It is. 

---

## MOTHER:
Sarah. This. Instant.

---

## BEN:
Run along! Your mother calls. And my dear sister is not to be trifled with.

---

She terrifies me.

---

## SARAH:
I’m only learning a few French words for society. 

---

The tutor is also teaching me how to curtsy; when to smile and laugh. And when to keep silent. 

---

It’s all just for show. My brothers are allowed to attend real school. 

---

## BEN:
Yes, well. France will wait for you. For now, stay curious, ask questions, make mistakes. 

---

[CLOCK TICKING]

And, above all, do not waste time. For time is what life is made of. 

---

## SARAH:
Fine! 

---

## BEN:
Whew. 

---

## SARAH:
Do not waste time? Do not waste time, you say? Well, then, I shall not. Not a single second.

---

[CLOCK CHIMES]

---

## MESMER:
Welcome to Dr. Mesmer’s amazing clinic, where your ailments will be vanquished, und your illnesses cured! 

---

Und now. Let us begin. 
[MYSTERIOUS HUM]

---

Ahem. Charles? 

---

## CHARLES:
Hmm? 


---

## MESMER:
Let us begin! 

---

## CHARLES:
Mmh! Mmmmhmm... 

---

(in a French accent)
Close your eyes! 

---

## MESMER:
No! No! Eyes stay open, stare into my eyes. 

---

No, you don’t stare into my eyes. Tell them to stare into my eyes...! 

---

## CHARLES:
Stare... into my eyes! 

---

## MESMER:
No, my eyes! 

---

## CHARLES:
“My eyes.” That is what I said...? 

---

## MESMER:
My. Eyes. 

---

## CHARLES:
Ah! I should say stare into YOUR eyes? 

---

## MESMER:
Yes! 

---

## CHARLES:
Stare into... your eyes. 

---

## MESMER:
No, no! How do you stare into your own eyes?!? 

---

Never mind... start with the glass armonica!

---

[MYSTERIOUS MUSIC]

Now then. Stare into my eyes! 

---

Feel the extraordinary energy I have captured in my wand!

---

And which I am... now channeling... to you! 

---

Feel the power. 

---

You are warm! Feel the heat! You are cured!

---

## FRENCHMAN:
Merci, monsieur!

---

## MESMER:
You are cold, feel the chill. You are cured! 

---

## FRENCHWOMAN:
Aaaaah! Merci!

---

## MESMER:
You are cold, feel the chill. You are cured! 

---

## FRENCHPERSON:
Merci!

---

## MESMER:
You are light as a feather. 

---

## BOTH:
Oh, oh, OH!

---

## MESMER:
You are cured! 

---

## FRENCHPERSON:
Merci!

---

## MESMER:
I am exhausted by my own brilliance! I must rest.
[MUSIC FADES]

---

## CROWD:
I’ll give you 2 coins to cure me! 5 coins! 10 coins! 

---

## MESMER:
I will return!

[SLOW FANCY MUSIC PLAYING]

---

[MUSIC FADES, PERSISTENT KNOCKING]

---

## KING:
(In a thick French accent)
What’s all the racket! Who’s banging at the palace doors in the middle of the night?

---

Wait a minute. I cannot answer the door. I am the king. 

---

Servants? SERVANTS!!!!! 

---

## SERVANTS:
Ohhhh, pardon! Ohhh!

---

[KNOCKING]

---

## KING:
Make it stop! Make it stop! 

---

Answer the door! 

---

[TRUMPET SOUNDS]

---

## SERVANT OFFSTAGE:
Docteur Sangsue and Docteur Laville to see King Louis the XVI. 

---

## KING:
What’s all the fuss?! Couldn’t this have waited until morning? 

---

## DOCTOR 1:
This Doctor Mesmer continues to be a nuisance.

---

## DOCTOR 2:
He is stealing our patients. 

---

## DOCTOR 1:
And our patients’ money. 

---

## DOCTOR 2:
And, therefore, our money. 

---

## KING:
Hmm. The patients are going to Mesmer for a cure... 

---

## DOCTOR 1:
Even though we have brilliant treatments... 

---

## DOCTOR 2:
Treatments like leeches! Did you bring the leeches? 

---

## KING:
What do they do exactly... the leeches? 

---

## DOCTOR 1:
They suck out the bad blood... 

---

## KING:
Ick. That doesn’t sound so fun. And what does Mesmer do? 

---

## DOCTOR 2:
He uses a magic wand. 

---

## KING:
A magic wand? That’s it? 

---

## DOCTORS:
Oui.

---

## KING:
Patients pay Mesmer and not the doctors... The doctors have less money, and so, I have less money.

---

## ALL:
Taxes! 

---

## KING:
I must go and count my gold. I like to check on it, make sure all the piles are equal, 

---

and look at my little, tiny face on every single coin! 

---

Did you know that? My face is on every coin! Ha ha!

---

## SERVANT OFFSTAGE:
Docteur Tardé to see King Louis the XVI! 

---

## DOCTOR 1:
Finally! 

---

## DOCTOR 3:
Am I late? 

---

## DOCTOR 2:
Yes, but never mind. Do you have the leeches? 

---

## DOCTOR 3:
Oops! I knew I was forgetting something! 

---

## DOCTOR 2:
That guy! Always a day late and a leech short! 

---

## DOCTOR 1:
He is such a poo-poo head.

---

The patients say they are cured. 

---

## DOCTOR 2:
But they cannot actually be cured! 

---

## DOCTOR 1:
They say they feel better.

---

## DOCTOR 2:
But they cannot possibly feel better! 

---

## DOCTOR 1:
Mesmer says he is a doctor... 

---

## DOCTOR 2:
But he is just a quack! 

---

[QUACK QUACK]

---

## KING:
Pay no mind, my wife keeps ducks. 

---

## DOCTOR 1:
You said you would investigate! 

---

## DOCTOR 2:
Interrogate! 

---

## DOCTORS 1 & 2:
 You said you would do something! 

---

[FOG HORN]

---

## KING:
Help is on the way!

## BEN:
Hello France, Bonjour France!

## CROWD:
Bonjour, Monsieur Franklin!! / Get your Ben Franklin T-Shirt!

---

## BEN:
And let me tell you about the lightning rod! And the electrostatic machine! Have you heard the one about the kite and key? 

---

## CROWD:
Ma chère papa! Ma chère papa!

---

## BEN:
And this... ...is a little invention called the “double-spectacle”! 

---

## CROWD:
Ooh la la! Muah, muah!

## BEN:
Thank you! Thank you very much! 

---

I must go to meet the King! 

---

## STEWARD:
Monsieur, Monsieur! Votre coffre! Your trunk! Mon dieu, but it is heavy. 

---

[GRUNTING, SIGHS]

---

[KNOCKING]

---

Rats! Rats in the trunk! Aaaahhh!!!

---

## SARAH:
Bonjour, France! I have arrived!

---

[UPBEAT HARPSICHORD]

---

## BEN:
Now, young lady. 

---

What in the name of gravity are you doing here dressed as a boy!?! 

---

## SARAH:
Being curious? Making mistakes I can learn from? 

---

And, and... not wasting time! Just like you said! Remember? 

---

## BEN:
I meant play your music! Study your French, practice spinning the.... hoop! 

---

I did not mean follow me as a stowaway to France! 

---

My goodness! This is no place for a girl. This is... this is Paris! 

---

## SARAH:
Surely, there are girls here? Look! I see one! Two!! 

---

## BEN:
Does your mother know where you are? 

---

## SARAH:
I left a note. 

---

## BEN:
A note!? 

---

## SARAH:
...Several notes? 

---

Then I fixed the trunk, so it wouldn’t lock. And when I got on board, I made friends with the cook. 

---

He made me the most wonderful suppers... 

---

## BEN:
And nobody stopped you? 

---

## SARAH:
Not dressed like a boy, they didn’t! 

---

I told anyone who asked that I was your grandson! People even wanted my autograph! 

---

## BEN:
And what is it you plan to do now? 

---

## SARAH:
My plan is to help you, Uncle Ben! With your experiments, your inventions, 

---

and now... with your investigation of Dr. Mesmer! 

---

## BEN:
I am leaving for the palace shortly. I cannot bring you with me... 

---

Can I? No, no, no... that will not work. 

---

## SARAH:
Why not? 

---

## BEN:
The negotiations with the king can be very tense. 

---

## SARAH:
Negotiations? What’s that? 

---

## BEN:
Discussions. Talks. Where both people want to get their own way. 

---

## SARAH:
Oh, I am very good at that.

---

## BEN:
Hmm. That is very true. I must send word to your mother that you are safe! 

---

Oh dear, my sister is not going to be happy with either of us... not happy at all. 

---

You are rather convincing as a boy. 

---

## SARAH:
Perhaps I can be your assistant! 

---

## BEN:
No no no, you couldn’t possibly be my assistant. 

---

You could be my valet. 

---

## SARAH:
Of course! Your valet! What’s a valet? 

---

## BEN:
It’s a sort of assistant. 

---

[CLOCK CHIMES]
## BEN:
I am due at the palace! This will have to work. 

---

[MYSTERIOUS MUSIC]

---

## MESMER:
Yes, I have returned!

---

Let us begin. Over here. You are warm, feel the heat. 

---

Over here. You are cold, feel the chill. 

---

Now, my favorite. You are light as a feather.

---

## CHARLES:
Dr. Mesmer, Dr. Mesmer!!

---

## MESMER:
Charles, I’m in the middle of something. 

---

## CHARLES:
Ben Franklin is here.

---

## MESMER:
What?? 

---

## CHARLES:
He has his wonderful invention the double spectacle- 

---

## MESMER:
Ben Frahn-klin?? I will return. 

---

## CHARLES:
Wait! Dr. Mesmer, I got you a t-shirt!

---

## MESMER:
Charles!

[CRASHING, CAT WAILING]

---

[TRUMPET SOUNDING]

---

## SERVANT OFFSTAGE:
Monsieur Benjamin Franklin! And his... ...petit valet...to see King Louis the XVI. 

---

## BEN:
Buh-buh-buh-buh-buh, wait. 

---

Before we see the king, you should know, I am going to ask him to help us fight the revolution. 

---

## SARAH:
King Louis seems too fancy to fight. 

---

## BEN:
Much too fancy! But his gold will buy ammunition, food and supplies for our suffering soldiers. 

---

If I help the king with his mess... ...perhaps he will help us with ours. 

---

[FANCY UPBEAT HARPSICHORD]

---

## SARAH:
This is heavenly! 

---

## SERVANT:
Croissant? 

---

## BEN:
Merci. Now to the business of the day... 

---

## SERVANT:
Profiterole? 

---

## BEN:
Ah! No, thank you. 

---

## SARAH:
Yum! 

---

## SERVANT:
Bon-bon. 

---

## SARAH:
Definitely! 

---

## BEN:
This is not really what a valet does... 

---

## SARAH:
I’m not really a valet! 

---

[MUSIC FADES]

---

## KING:
Thank goodness you’ve arrived! I have a tremendous problem! 

---

## DOCTORS OFFSTAGE:
Down with Mesmer! Down with Mesmer! 

---

## KING:
You hear the doctors? They are so angry! I cannot go on like this! It is madness! 

---

## BEN:
Yes, I read your letter with interest. This Dr. Mesmer is quite intriguing. Even George Washington has mentioned him. 

---

## KING:
Intriguing? Non! Non, non, non. It is intolerable! 

---

## DOCTORS OFFSTAGE:
Down with Mesmer, Down with-

---

## KING:
Fix it! Fix it!

---

## BEN:
I will help you. But you must also help us. May I sit? 

---

## KING:
Non! Walk with me... Now. Tell me! How is it going with the revolution? I think it is a splendid idea. 

---

Break away from that silly, old England! You can do it! 

---

## BEN:
We are doing our best. And very close to succeeding...but we do need your help with the fight. 

---

## KING:
Oh, I am much too fancy to fight. 

---

## BEN:
No, no. We need your help with the soldiers. They need supplies and ammunition. 

---

## SARAH:
They need food... 

---

## KING:
Let them eat cake! I heard that somewhere... it’s very catchy. 

---

## BEN:
Your highness...the situation is serious. 

---

## KING:
Why do I get the feeling he’s about to ask me for money...

---

## BEN:
I must ask you... for money. 

---

## KING:
But I gave you mountains of money. Just last year! For the same revolution! 

---

It is the same revolution, yes? 

---

## BEN:
Yes. Turns out it’s very expensive to start a country.

---

## KING:
Monsieur Franklin-- I don’t know how I can help you. 

---

The doctors are losing money. And when they lose money, I lose money. 

---

## KING & BEN: 
Taxes. 

---

## SARAH:
Seems like he has plenty of money. 

---

## KING:
My piles of gold are shrinking daily! 

---

## DOCTORS:
Down with Mesmer!

---

## KING:
Make it stop, Ben Franklin! Make it stoppppp! 

---

## BEN:
The problem seems clear: We must determine whether Mesmer is a legitimate healer or if he is simply a quack!

---

[QUACK QUACK!]

---

## KING:
Pay no mind. My wife keeps ducks... 

---

## MARIE:
(high-pitched)
Oh! Oh oh oh oh!

---

(in a thick French accent)
What I have seen!!

---

## KING:
May I present my wife... Marie Antoinette aka Queen of France! 

---

Monsieur Franklin is here... ... for more gold... 

---

## BEN:
Oh, well, yes... but really we are asking for continued support of the revolution. 

---

## MARIE:
Revolution?! In France?! Impossible! 

---

## KING:
Non, non, non... the AMERICAN revolution!

---

Ha! The look on your face... Revolution...Non, non, it could never happen here! 

---

## BOTH:

Hahahaha! (sigh)

---

## MARIE:
Ah. Of course. American Revolution. You can do it! 

---

## KING:
And Monsieur Franklin is also here to help us with that pesky little Mesmer problem. 

---

## MARIE:
Pesky? Little? Problem? Non, non, non! Au contraire! Doctor Mesmer is thrilling! A savior! 

---

And quite tall...

---

## KING:
You see, this is what I’m talking about! It is a mania! 

---

## MARIE:
AAH!! Let me tell you what happened... 

---

[MYSTERIOUS HARPSICHORD]

I had a terrible headache... I have no idea what was causing it. 

---

Shhh. There was a buzz all around Paris... 

---

Doctor Mesmer, Doctor Mesmer, Doctor Mesmer. Lady Champignon told Monsieur Mimolette... 

---

## FRENCHPERSON:
Mon dieu!

---

## MARIE:
...who spoke to Madame Frederic... 

---

## FRENCHPERSON:
Zut alors!

---

## MARIE:
...who said something to Monsieur Arc-en-Ciel.

---

## FRENCHPERSON:
Sacre bleu!

---

## MARIE:
Who divulged the details to moi! 

---

I simply could not believe what I was hearing. So I went to see Dr. Mesmer for myself. 

---

And I was... ...mesmerized!!!

---

[ELECTRIC BUZZING]

## MESMER:
I am exhausted by my own brilliance. I must rest.

---

I will return! 

---

Charles!

---

Money money money... I love that sound.

---

## WOMAN:
Help me!

---

## MESMER:
I cannot help you, shepherdess. I am resting and recharging... 

---

And you could never afford me. 

---

## WOMAN:
But I am in pain! 

---

And I have brought this. 

---

[ANGELIC CHORUS]

---

## MESMER:
I suddenly feel... rested! And... recharged! Charles! Bring me my wand!

---

## CHARLES:
Your majesty! 

---

## MESMER:
Nien! 

---

## MARIE:
Ja! 

---

## MESMER:
It is an honor to serve the crown. 

---

## MARIE:
And just like that, he removed my head... ache. 

---

## KING:
And gave it to me. Oh, Monsieur Franklin, I hope you can get us out of this messy Mesmer mess! 

---

## BEN:
It all does seem rather outrageous. 

---

## DOCTORS OFFSTAGE:
Down with Mesmer!!

---

## KING:
Yikes! More angry doctors at the door! 

---

I will not rest until we have an answer! Like, literally, I will not be able to sleep. 

---

## BEN:
Leave it to me...

Owwwwwww! 

---

## SARAH:
Uncle? What is wrong? 

---

## BEN:
It’s the gout!

---

## MARIE:
Dr. Mesmer can cure your illness! Yes! He can work wonders. 

---

[THUNDER, RAIN]

---

## SARAH:
Do you think Mesmer has real power? 

---

## BEN:
I don’t think anything yet. That would be jumping to conclusions-- not very scientific at all! 

---

But I am starting to form a hypothesis... 

---

## SARAH:
Oh no, is that because of the gout? 

---

## BEN:
Ha, no, no.  A hypothesis is a sort of guess, remember? 

---

## BOTH:
An educated guess 

---

## BEN

at what might be occurring. 

---

From what we know, Mesmer’s techniques all sound a bit absurd. 

---

Telling people to believe in a power that comes from a field of energy? I mean, really... 

---

[THUNDER BOOMS]

---

## SARAH:
But, uncle, are you forgetting your kite and key experiment? 

---

## BEN:
How could I forget that one! Almost fried my hair. 

---

## SARAH:
We didn’t understand much about electricity until your experiment. 

---

## BEN:
True. 

---

## SARAH:
You had a problem to solve... 

---

## BEN:
How to harness electricity. 

---

## SARAH:
You had a hyper-thought! 

---

## BEN:
Hypothesis. 

---

## SARAH:
Right. Hypothesis. You did an experiment and collected data... 

---

[THUNDER CRASHES, SPOOKY MUSIC]

---

## BEN:
In this experiment, I am attempting to harness electricity! 

---

To grab onto lightning from the heavens, by reaching up with a kite! 

---

## SARAH:
Oh, ho! Here it comes! 

[DING]

---

The electrical charge is making its way to the metal key! 

---

## BEN:
Be careful! It’s pure power! 

[MUSIC SWELLING]

---

## SARAH:
Conclusion?! 

---

## BEN:
The heavens are full of energy! Electricity can be harnessed from above! Seemingly out of nowhere... 

---

## SARAH:
A power is there.

[THUNDER CRASHES, MUSIC FADES]

---

So how can you be certain Mesmer’s power is any different? 

---

How are we going to learn anything if we are not learning anything?

---

## BEN:
That does make a bit of sense. We must give Mesmer's method a fair shake. We must test it! 

---

[THUNDER CRASHES]

---

[TRUMPET SOUNDS]

Monsieur Ben Franklin nd his uh... petit valet to see the King Louis the XVI.

---

## KING:
Well?!? 

---

## BEN:
We must consider the possibility that the wand may have some power. 

---

## KING:
What do you mean the wand may have some power? 

---

I thought you said, and I quote: “It all does sound rather outrageous.” 

---

## SARAH:
Tying a key to a kite and flying it in a lightning storm also sounds pretty outrageous. 

---

## KING:
Now that’s bananas!

---

## BEN:
Anyway, the point is. We must approach this problem scientifically. Ignore both the acolytes and the cynics. 

---

## SARAH:
Huh? 

---

## BEN:
The lovers and the haters. Shake it off, my dear. 

---

What we need is “The Scientific Method.”

---

It allows us to put aside our personal feelings and assumptions. 

---

## KING:
Go on.

---

## BEN:
First we establish the problem... 

---

## KING:
The problem is the doctors pounding on my door! 

---

## BEN:
No no no, that is a side-effect. Then make some observations! 

---

## KING:
I observe the angry doctors! 

---

## BEN:
Then we arrive at a question... 

---

## KING:
Will the doctors every stop being so angry? 

---

## BEN:
No, the question is: Can Mesmer actually cure patients with the wave of a wand? 

---

## SARAH:
Then we come up with a hyperthought-- 

---

## BEN:
Hypothesis-- 

---

## KING:
Hypothesis? 

---

## SARAH:
An educated guess. 

---

## BEN:
Then we do an experiment, collect and analyze the data... 

---

## SARAH:
...and we form a conclusion! 

---

## KING:
This all sounds complicated. 

---

## SARAH:
This all sounds like fun! 

---

## BEN:
I will write to Mesmer and have him to come to me. 

---

## SARAH:
To begin the experiment! 

---

## MESMER:
Me? Go to Frahnklin? Never! 

---

## CHARLES:
I thought you’d be thrilled to demonstrate your techniques?

---

## MESMER:
Those beady little eyes, and those... mangled contraptions?! 

---

## CHARLES:
The double-spectacle! It is a wonderful invention. By Monsieur Franklin himself! 

---

## MESMER:
Of course it is! Benjamin Frahnklin, Benjamin Frahnklin. 

---

He’s here, he’s there, he’s everywhere! 

---

I swear, it's all about the Benjamins! Whyyyyy... 

---

## CHARLES:
Maybe it’s his brilliant mind? 

---

## MESMER:
Not helpful! 

---

## CHARLES:
He even invented your favorite instrument. The glass armonica! 

---

## MESMER:
Something stinks. 

---

## CHARLES:
Go to him.

---

## MESMER:
Not a chance. But. If he came to me...

---

Und observed my brilliance. On my terms. That might be... tolerable. 

---

## MESMER:
Sich sputen! 

---

Geh mit Eile... 

---

Nien. Handle wie der Wind und fliege mit Eile von hier weg! Im Augenblick! 

---

## CHARLES:
While I do enjoy a good waltz and absolutely love the sausages, 

---

I don't speak German. 

---

## MESMER:
Go tell him!!! 

---

[UPBEAT HARPSICHORD]

[KNOCKING]

## BEN:
The wig!

---

## CHARLES:
You are formally invited to witness the brilliant techniques of Dr. Franz Mesmer at his clinic, Place Vendome, Paris! 

---

## SARAH:
Ah! Wonderful! 

---

## CHARLES:
Wonderful! 

---

## SARAH:
Marvelous! 

---

## CHARLES:
Marvelous! 

---

## BEN:
Alas, I cannot go! 

---

## CHARLES:
Cannot go! Wait-- why not? 

## SARAH:
Why not, Uncle!? 

---

## CHARLES:
Uncle?

## SARAH:
We have to see Dr. Mesmer! The experiment! 

---

## CHARLES:
Experiment? 

---

## BEN:
Yes, but his clinic is on a very bad road. 

---

## CHARLES:
Oh... 

---

## BEN:
Full of ruts and broken cobblestones! 

---

## CHARLES:
Cobblestones...this is true…

---

## BEN:
The carriage ride there would be harrowing. 
Have I mentioned the gout? 

---

## SARAH:
Oh, yes. You have. Several times. 

---

## BEN:
No, no. It is settled. Mesmer must come to me! 

---

[HARPSICHORD RIFF]

---

## MESMER:
Absolutely not! Tell Frahnklin, he comes to me or we do not have a deal! 

---

## BEN:
He must come to me! 

---

## MESMER:
No! To me! 

---

## BEN:
No! To me! 

---

## MESMER:
No! To me! 

---

## BEN:
Non! A moi! 

---

## MESMER:
Nein! Für mich! 

---

## BEN:
No! Para mí! 

---

## MESMER:
Nee! Voor mij! 

---

## BEN:
Hapana kwa ajili yangu! 

---

## MESMER:
Watashi ni wa not! 

---

[SILENCE]

---

## BEN:
I don’t know any more languages!! 

---

## KING:
Mesmer says he won’t go to Franklin. And Franklin says he can’t go to Mesmer... 

---

## MARIE:
Wait a moment! Franklin won’t go to Mesmer and Mesmer won’t go to Franklin. 

---

Why don’t they come to us? To the palace! 

---

## KING:
Ben Franklin and Dr. Mesmer here? At the palace? Oui! Oui! It is the perfect solution. 

---

## BOTH:
Hahahaha! (sigh)

---

[BOXING BELL RINGS, CROWD CHEERING]

---

## ANNOUNCER:
Franklin vs. Mesmer! One night only! 

---

Is Mesmer mystic or scientific? Your questions answered!!

---

It's a battle for the crown, folks!

---

## KING
A battle for the crown? Mais non!

[TECHNO MUSIC PLAYING]

## MESMER:
Look into my eyes!

## SARAH:
What is happening? 

---

## BEN:
I’m not entirely certain. Let’s continue to observe... 

---

## MESMER: 
(speaking rhythmically)
You are feeling warm.

---

You are feeling cold.

---

## MESMER:
Light as a feather, hands up in the air!
Light as a feather, hands up in the air!

[MUSIC ENDS]

I am exhausted by my own brilliance! 

---

## MARIE:
Bravo! Bravo! 

---

## BEN:
Fascinating! Extraordinary, Indeed! 

---

## KING:
Does he have powers? Are you convinced?!

---

## BEN:
Not in the least! 

---

## MARIE:
But... Monsieur Franklin... did you not say “fascinating”? 

---

## BEN:
I did! 

---

## CHARLES:
Did you not say “extraordinary”? 

---

## BEN:
Certainly, I did! 

---

## KING:
Did you not see scientific proof of people being cured? 

---

## BEN:
I did... not. 

---

## SARAH:
What we witnessed was remarkable and thrilling... 

---

## BEN:
...but there is no proof that the wand was working... 

---

## SARAH:
...or not working... 

---

## BEN:
...and if the wand was working... 

---

## SARAH:
...we have no proof of what that working wand was! 

---

## EVERYONE:
What?

---

## BEN:
What we need is... 

---

## BOTH:
The Scientific Method! 

---

[SHOWTUNE-ESQUE HARPSICHORD]

---

## BEN:
(speaking rhythmically)
First, we observe the problem and ask a question!

---

## SARAH:
Does Dr. Mesmer’s magic wand really cure the people? 

---

## BEN:
That is the “question” we are asking... 

---

## SARAH:
...the “problem” we are trying to solve. 

---

## BEN:
From what we can “observe” I am ready to make an educated guess, also known as a... 

---

## SARAH:
Hypothesis! 

[MUSIC ENDS]

---

## BOTH:
Our hypothesis is... 

---

## SARAH:
If patients think they will be cured, then they will feel as if they are cured! 

---

## BEN:
Isn’t that the same thing as being cured? 

---

## SARAH:
Not at all. Dr. Mesmer’s power has nothing to do with the wand, and everything to do with people’s imaginations. 

---

## BEN:
I’m confused. 

---

## SARAH:
I’ll show you what I mean. Dr. Mesmer, will you see another patient? 

---

## MESMER:
Ja, ja... I can do this all day. 

---

[SHOWTUNE RIFF]

## SARAH:
The experiment! 

---

[DRUMROLL]

## BEN:
My favorite part! I have a piece of equipment that I have brought, 

---

all the way from America, which we will use to conduct this experiment. 

---

And...Voila! 

---

## MARIE:
A blindfold?

---

## KING:
That’s it??? 

---

## BEN:
We will use this blindfold to cover the patient’s eyes. 

---

## SARAH:
Then we will collect some DATA and RESULTS and do some ANALYSIS! 

---

## BEN:
Do we have a volunteer to be mesmerized for science? 

---

## MARIE:
Oh, me, me, me!  I am the Queen, and I love science! 

---

## BEN:
Your majesty. Please mesmerize the patient! 

---

## MESMER:
No. 

---

## CHARLES:
Simply do what you usually do. 

---

## MESMER:
This is not how I do things! And you are not the boss of me, Ben Frahnklin. 

---

## KING:
But I am. Now...I order you to mesmerize my wife! 

---

[MYSTERIOUS MUSIC]

---

## MESMER:
Ahem… Feel the burning heat!

---

## MARIE:
Yes! It feels warm! It feels wonderful ...In my ear!

---

## MESMER:
Um, do you still feel the warmth? 

---

## MARIE:
Yes! But now it’s wrapped around... my ankle! It was sore but the energy is healing it! 

---

## MESMER:
Ahem. And now? 

---

## MARIE
Whoah, whoah, whoah, lalalalalala!!

---

## MARIE:
(burps) My tummy ache is cured! 

---

## MESMER:
This is ridiculous! 

---

## BEN:
Dr. Mesmer, please continue to mesmerize the patient! Feel the heat, your Majesty, as you are Mesmerized... 

---

## MARIE:
Oh, I am so hot, I am so cold!

---

Whoah! Whoah! Whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah-

---

Ohhh la, la! I feel so much better.

---

Aaaaughgh!

---

## KING:
Wait. The-wand-was-pointed... here But-nothing-happened-and-then-the wand-was-pointed...there... 

---

And-nothing-happened!-But-when-the-wand-was-not-pointed-ANYWHERE 

---

Voila! The-patient-felt-something, but-there-was-nothing... 

---

Mesmer has no power! No power at all! He is an imposter! 

---

Off with his heaaaaaad! 

---

## BEN:
Not so fast, your Highness. There’s not necessarily a crime here. If Mesmer has zero power ... 

---

## MESMER:
(in American accent) 
Bro, c'mon.. 

---

## BEN:
Then he’s done nothing wrong!

[BOXING BELL RINGS]

---

## SARAH:
Conclusion! 

---

## BEN:
One moment! We must do this all again! 

---

## SARAH:
But don’t we already have our conclusion? 

---

## BEN:
The more people we include in the experiment... 

---

## SARAH:
The better the experiment! 

---

## BEN:
Let’s gather more patients! 

---

[UPBEAT HARPSICHORD]

---

[RECORD SCRATCH]

---

## BEN:
Do you expect something to happen? 

---

## PATIENT:
Yes! 

---

It happened! 

---

## BEN:
Do you think something will happen? 

---

## PATIENT:
No. 

---

Nope. 

---

## BEN:
What do you expect? 

---

## PATIENT:
To be cured!

---

I’m cured! 

---

## BEN:
What about you? 

---

## PATIENT:
I don’t expect to feel anything at all. 

---

Nothin’. Just like I thought.

---

## PATIENT:
Yup, wow!

---

## PATIENT:
Maybe. Maybe?

---

Let's gather more patients.

[MUSIC SPEEDS UP]

---

## ALL:
Yep! / No. / Maybe? / Duh. / I don't think so.

---

[MUSIC GETS FASTER AND HIGHER]

## ALL:
UM / Yeah? / Let me just- / Yeah, sure!

---

[MUSIC ENDS]

---

## BEN:
The patients only feel something if they think they will! My– 

---

Our conclusion: 

---

## SARAH:
The imagination is an extremely powerful force! 

---

## BEN:
Even more so than I thought! The power is not in the wand. 

---

## BEN AND SARAH:
 The power is in the mind! 
 
 [BOXING BELL RINGS]

---

## BEN:
Thank you, everyone. This has been informative! 

---

Thank you, Dr. Mesmer. There, there! No crying necessary! 

---

We had a problem, 

---

## Sarah:

we formed a hypothesis, 

---

## BEN:
we performed an experiment, 

---

## Sarah:
and collected data and did some analysis. 

---

## BEN:
Then we delivered a conclusion! It is science in its purest form. 

---

## MESMER:
Science-schmience! I still say my method works! 

---

I wave the wand. People feel better. Why can’t that be enough?

---

## Charles: 
Dr. Mesmer!

---

## SARAH:
A question for you doctors before we go…

---

## DOCTOR 1:
Yes? 

---

## DOCTOR 2:
What is it? 

---

## DOCTOR 3:
You tiny, little man. 

---

## SARAH:
Have you ever tested your leeches by putting them through the Scientific Method? 

---

## DOCTOR 1:
I have an idea: we shall use the Scientific Method... 

## DOCTOR 2:
Doctor, I’ve had have a wonderful idea to use the Scientific Method on the leeches-- 

---

## DOCTOR 3:
You know what I think would be good: to test the leeches using the Scientific Method... 

---

## BEN:
I have a feeling there is about to be a lot more science.

---

## KING:
This has been most helpful. 

---

## BEN:
Yes, it was quite enlightening. 

---

## KING: 
Well, bon voyage! 

---

## BEN:
Aren’t you forgetting something? 

---

## KING:
I don’t think so... 

---

[KA-CHING]

---

## KING:
Oh! That... Of course. Would you like a small, medium, large, or... king-sized gold? 

---

## BEN:
King-sized, please. 

---

## KING:
Servants! One king-sized gold for Monsieur Franklin! Monsieur Franklin, right this way... 

---

## BEN:
I’ll be right back. 

---

## KING:
I didn’t forget about the gold, but I was hoping he would! C’est la vie! 

---

[GENTLE HARPSICHORD]

---

## MARIE:
Ahem. I think this belongs to you? 

---

## SARAH:
So you know I’m a girl?

---

## MARIE:
Your secret is safe with me. 

---

## SARAH:
It’s hard to keep a secret. 

---

## MARIE:
But the wig helps! My wig allows me to be whomever I wish to be!

---

## SARAH:
And mine turned me into someone else entirely. 

---

## MARIE:
Don’t be sad! You impressed everyone! 

---

You were a valet, Monsieur Franklin’s assistant, even a scientist using the scientific method! 

---

That’s wonderful, non? 

---

## SARAH:
Yes, but I had to wear boys’ clothes to do it. I had to be someone I’m not. When, really, I was the one with all the ideas! 

---

## MARIE:
But this had nothing to do with the wig… 

---

## SARAH:
Or these clothes… 

---

## MARIE:
It has nothing to do with what is on the outside. 

---

## SARAH:
It was me the whole time… Sarah. 

---

## MARIE:
And Sarah is amazing. 

---

[OCEAN WAVES, FOG HORN]

## MARIE:
Where is he? Where is the king? Ooooohhh...

---

## KING:
We did it! Science!

---

## MARIE:
I miss that cute little Ben Franklin and his furry little hat and silly little spectacles. 

---

## KING:
He did get quite a bit of gold out of me. But, you’re right, he's adorable! 

---

## MARIE:
And what is that thing he said he was trying to do? 

---

## KING:
Build a country? 

---

## MARIE:
A government by the people? 

---

## KING:
And -- and-- --for the people...? 

---

## BOTH:
Hahahahah! (sigh)

---

It will never work!!

[MYSTERIOUS MUSIC]

---

## MESMER:
What is that music? Wait-- have I mesmerized myself? 

---

## CHARLES:
Dr. Mesmer! 

---

## MESMER:
Charles!

---

## CHARLES:
I followed you all the way to Switzerland! 

---

Wow, am I hungry! Fondue?

---

## MESMER:
Hmmm...looks like a wand... Acts like a wand... 

---

## CHARLES:
It is a wand!

---

## MESMER:
There are some people whom Ben Frahnklin and his science will never convince! 

---

Let’s go find them. Come, Charles, patients await! Don't forget my luggage!

Not really. France was so exciting! I got to conduct experiments. 

---

## BEN:
Your contributions were essential.

---

## SARAH:
I got to say things, and people listened. Now I have to go back to... 

---

## MOTHER:
Sarah! 

---

[FIREWORKS]

---

## BEN:
But look! The war is coming to an end, and it’s the beginning of a new country... a new experiment... 

---

## SARAH:
Uncle Ben, do you hear me? I cannot go back to just doing what I’m told, sitting properly, 

---

holding my tea cup just so, not thinking for myself or even being myself! 

---

## MOTHER:
Time for your lessons! 

---

## BEN:
Dear sister-- Sarah is... 

---

Busy. Helping me. With an experiment. 

---

## MOTHER:
Ok. 

---

## BEN:
Ok? 

---

## MOTHER:
Just don’t let her hop the next boat to France! 

---

## BEN:
It’s a deal! 

---

## MOTHER:
AND NO LIGHTNING!! 

---

## SARAH:
Another experiment, Uncle Ben?

---

## BEN:
Perhaps the greatest experiment of all!

---

We are building a new country. The United States of America. 

---

One without a king or a queen. One built and run by the people-- 

---

## SARAH:
A country not run by a king or a queen -- is it possible?

---

## BEN:
I do not know. 

---

## SARAH:
But you’ve written words and words and more words about this new country. How can you not know? 

---

## BEN:
If we’ve learned anything from Dr. Mesmer, my dear, it’s that the power was not in his wand, but in the imaginations of the people. 

---

A wand is just a wand! And a pen is just a pen. The power is not in the pen. It's...

---

## SARAH:
It’s in the people. 

---

## BEN:
Yes. In their hearts and minds. 

---

## SARAH:
The Constitution...

---

## BEN:
Yes, go ahead. Read the first line. 

---

## SARAH:
We the people.

---

I’m a person, Uncle Ben. Am I in here? What about my mother? 

---

## BEN:
Oh, my dear sister... 

---

## SARAH:
Or… People who don’t look like... um...well… like you. 

---

## BEN:
I-- I don’t have an answer for that. 

---

## SARAH:
We all should be part of this experiment, Uncle Ben. 

---

Every single one of us. The more people we include in the experiment, the better the experiment will be! 

---

You said so yourself. 

---

[FIREWORKS] 

---

## BEN:
What is YOUR prediction? 

---

## SARAH:
You want to know my hypothesis? About this whole United States of America experiment?

---

## BEN:
Your ideas are essential. 

---

[FLUTES PLAYING YANKEE DOODLE]

## SARAH:
I’m still observing... questioning.

And I think this is just the beginning.
