## PRINCIPAL:
Good morning,
Washington High students.
---
Before we get started
with today's safety training assembly,
---
I want to remind you of the guidelines
you should all be following
---
while on school grounds.
---
First, you are required to wear
a face mask
---
that covers both your mouth
and nose at all times.
---
Failure to do so will result
in ejection from the premises.
---
Next, take a moment
and silence all your cell phones,
---
watches, and other noise-making devices,
now.
---
Please don't make me
ask this more than once.
---
Speaking of noise,
---
you should also be aware that portions
of today's safety training
---
will include top firearms
and multiple loud simulated gunshots.
---
In the event of an actual emergency,
---
please exit the way you came in,
in a calm and orderly manner,
---
and follow the instructions
of campus staff.
---
Today's assembly will last about two hours
---
with one 10-minute bathroom break
in the middle.
---
Thank you all again for your cooperation.
---
Let's get through the day safe and sound.
---
---
[bell rings]
---
Staff and students
of Washington High School,
---
we are in lockdown.
---
Please follow the standard
lockdown safety procedures.
---
If you have any questions,
make sure to ask your teacher,
---
but do not interrupt or create confusion
---
if he or she is trying
to initiate safety protocol.
---
We’re just trying to keep you safe.
---
Don’t do anything
to jeopardize your safety.
---
## WYNN:
Is this a drill or the real thing?
---
## LENORE:
Does it matter?
---
## WYNN:
Sure it does.
---
We are in the middle of something.
---
I'll text my girl.
---
## KRAMER:
This is the third drill
this month.
---
## LENORE:
We don't know if it's a drill.
---
Principal Falvey
didn't say it was a drill.
---
## SELMA:
She didn't say it was a drill
last time either, but it was.
---
## KRAMER:
We are fine.
---
We have security cameras
and locks on the doors.
---
## WYNN:
Still no answer.
---
Hope she's not shot.
---
## LENORE:
I didn't hear gunshots.
---
## SELMA:
We're supposed to be listening
to her.
---
## WYNN:
She looks nervous.
---
## LENORE:
She hasn't stopped talking.
--

## SELMA:
Did anyone see her lock the door?
---
## WYNN:
Why isn't she texting me back?
## SELMA:
She's in class.
---
## WYNN:
I'm in class.
## SELMA:
She actually pays attention.
---
Get off that thing.
---
## WYNN:
You are not the boss of me.
---
## SELMA:
This is serious.
## WYNN:
Is it?
---
You don't even know
if this is a drill or not.
---
## SELMA:
Even if it's a drill,
we need to take it seriously
---
so that we know what to do
when this really happens.
---
## WYNN:
If.
## KRAMER:
She keeps saying calm down
---
but she doesn't look very calm.
---
That body language communicates
a lot.
---
That's what my acting teacher says.
---
## WYNN:
Sounds like an expert.
---
## LENORE:
Will someone lock the door?
---
## KRAMER:
Aren't we supposed
to be underneath our desks?
---
## WYNN:
I don't know.
## LENORE:
I think so.
---
## SELMA:
Yes,
but she should be telling us what to do.
---
She is just reminding us to be calm.
---
What good is that?
## KRAMER:
Someone should tell her that.
---
## LENORE:
Shouldn't someone check
to see if the door is locked?
---
## KRAMER:
Why don't you do it?
---
## LENORE:
Sure, I could,
---
but I don't even know how it locks.
## KRAMER:
It locks like a door.
---
## LENORE:
Why don't you do it?
---
## KRAMER:
Because I don't care
if it's locked, it's a drill.
---
## LENORE:
We don't know that.
## KRAMER:
It doesn't matter.
---
## SELMA:
I'll do it.
---
[silence]
---
Get underneath your desks.
## KRAMER:
Why?
---
## LENORE:
She didn't say to.
## SELMA:
I said to.
---
## WYNN:
Oh come on, now.
---
## SELMA:
You too, jock boy.
---
[cell phone chime]
---
## WYNN:
It's just a drill.
---
## SELMA:
Stay down.
## WYNN:
It's not a real shooting.
---
## SELMA:
We still need to follow procedures.
## WYNN:
Says who?
---
## SELMA:
The school. We are doing
these drills so that we know what to do.
---
## WYNN:
Do you really think a locked door
and us crouching beneath our desks
---
is going to help against
a guy with a gun?
---
## SELMA:
It's better than doing nothing.
## WYNN:
It is doing nothing.
---
## Officer Daley:
 This is Officer Daley.
Room 160, secure.
---
Stay under your desk
and inside until the drill is over.
---
## SELMA:
See, it's important
to follow the rules.
---
## WYNN:
How many of these are we going
to have to do?
---
## KRAMER:
Is she crying?
---
[drum beats]
---
## KRAMER:
Sorry I'm late.
---
## KRAMER'S MOM:
That's okay.
I was wondering where you were.
---
## KRAMER'S DAD:
Mom made
a brilliant meatloaf for dinner.
---
## KRAMER'S MOM:
Oh, he's just saying that.
---
## KRAMER'S DAD:
No, I'm not, I mean it.
It might the best ever.
---
## KRAMER'S MOM:
Catalina dressing,
that’s the secret.
---
Wanda from work told me.
---
## KRAMER'S DAD:
That's interesting.
---
## KRAMER'S MOM:

It's not what you would think.
---
It tastes better when it's incorporated
in the meat and cooked.
---
Nothing at all like French dressing taste
on salads.
---
How was school today?
---
## KRAMER:
Great.
---
I gave my oral report
in History class today.
---
Mr. Evans seemed to like it.
## KRAMER'S DAD:
You worked so hard on that.
---
## KRAMER:
I got my Trig test back, B.
---
## KRAMER'S DAD:
Should I call the school?
---
See if Mr. Jones has anything against you?
---
## KRAMER:
No, dad, it's fine.
---
## KRAMER'S DAD:
Are you sure
he's not homophobic?
---
## KRAMER:
Dad, it's fine.
---
## KRAMER'S MOM:
Let it go, honey.
He said that he's handling it.
---
## KRAMER'S DAD:
I'm just saying if--
## KRAMER'S MOM:
Honey.
---
## KRAMER'S DAD:
What kept you
so long at school?
---
Drama Club? Student Council?
Speech and Debate?
---
## KRAMER:
I walked by the gym.
---
## KRAMER'S MOM:
You went to the gym?
## KRAMER:
I didn't go in,
---
I walked by five times, back and forth.
---
I thought about going in.
---
## KRAMER'S MOM:
Why didn't you?
---
## KRAMER:
All of those guys.
---
It's intimidating.
They're so strong and muscular.
---
## KRAMER'S MOM:
Since when are you intimidated?
---
## KRAMER:
I just don't know
if I'm strong enough.
---
## KRAMER'S MOM:
Well, you actually
have to go in to find out.
---
## KRAMER'S DAD:
All of those boys
with their big muscles,
---
they don't have what you have.
---
They're intimidated by you.
---
For them picking up a book is a lot harder
than picking up some dumbbell.
---
Imagine if you are smart, strong,
and a good actor,
---
then you will be a real triple threat.
---
## KRAMER:
Dad, I'm already a triple threat.
---
## KRAMER'S DAD:
A multiple threat, then.
Even better.
---
Eat up, you'll need your strength
at the gym.
---
[bell rings]
---
[school noise]
---
## SELMA:
Excuse me,
aren't you in the History class?
---
## LENORE:
Yes. I sit right next to you.
---
I see you every day.
---
## SELMA:
I know, but we've never talked.
---
## LENORE:
That's not my fault.
---
Oh, wait a minute.
---
Sorry, come back.
---
I didn't think you actually wanted
to talk to me.
---
## SELMA:
I was talking to you.
---
## LENORE:
No one ever wants to talk to me.
---
## SELMA:
I wonder why.
---
You shouldn't have freaked out
the other day, about the drill.
---
## LENORE:
I reacted like a normal person
would react.
---
## SELMA:
I'm a normal person,
and I was calm.
---
## WYNN:
[intense grunting]
---
## WYNN:
You need something?
---
## KRAMER:
I was just watching your form.
---
## WYNN:
It comes naturally.
---
## KRAMER:
What's that supposed to mean?
---
I'm unnatural?
---
## WYNN:
You really are like a girl, okay?
---
I'm not saying you're unnatural.
---
I'm just saying that doing guy stuff
comes more naturally to me.
---
## KRAMER:
That's still offensive.
---
## WYNN:
[grunt]For Christ's sake, pick up those 20s
and copy what I'm doing.
---
If you're going check me out,
---
you might as well be building muscle
at the same time.
---
## SELMA:
Do you know how hard it
is to get past school security?
---
## LENORE:
Anything's possible.
---
## SELMA:
It doesn't do anyone
any good to be scared.
---
## LENORE:
Fear isn't logical.
## SELMA:
Exactly.
---
I don't have time for it.
---
I have bigger things to worry about.
---
## LENORE:
Like what?
---
## SELMA:
Like not getting
into an Ivy League school.
---
That's scary.
---
## KRAMER:
Can we stop now?
---
My arms are tired.
---
## WYNN:
Sure,
---
but you're not going to get
any stronger by complaining.
---
## KRAMER:
Rome wasn't built in a day.
---
## WYNN:
You need to know
how to defend yourself.
---
## KRAMER:
Against what?
---
## WYNN:
Those guys who don't like you.
---
## KRAMER:
I have friends.
---
## WYNN:
Yes, but guys don't like you
because you're-- you know.
---
## KRAMER:
Gay?
## WYNN:
Shush,
---
we're in a gym.
## KRAMER:
I can't be gay in a gym?
---
## WYNN:
No. Push ups.
---
## LENORE:
I'm an actress.
---
## SELMA:
You're an actress?
---
## LENORE:
Does that surprise you?
---
## SELMA:
Yes.
---
You have to have courage
and confidence to get on stage, right?
---
## LENORE:
I'm working on it.
---
## SELMA:
Then just act courageous
and confident.
---
## LENORE:
Easy for you to say.
---
## SELMA:
A drill is just like a play, fake.
---
## LENORE:
I've never been cast
in a school play.
---
## SELMA:
So, you're not an actress?
---
## LENORE:
I'm not good enough.
---
## SELMA:
It sounds like you could use
some confidence.
---
You'll never be good enough
with that mentality.
---
[bell rings]
---
## WYNN:
See you around.
---
## KRAMER:
Thanks.
---
## WYNN:
For what?
---
## KRAMER:
The advice.
---
## WYNN:
I don't want you to hurt yourself.
---
## KRAMER:
Really?
---
## WYNN:
See you around.
---
[bell rings]
---
## PRINCIPAL:
Hello, students.
---
In light of recent
and all too frequent tragic events,
---
protecting your safety has a greater
meaning than ever before.
---
Simple lockdown drills are irrelevant
in this new era.
---
Today, we have a guest
who will explain the importance
---
of keeping yourselves
and your classmates safe.
---
I know you think
this doesn't apply to you, it does.
---
It can make the difference
between life and--
---
just listen, okay?
---
Take it seriously, please.
---
Pete?
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:

Do you feel safe?
---
## KRAMER:
Is that a rhetorical question?
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:

Ever since Sandy Hook,
every school has safety measures.
---
This one does.
---
They have to buzz in visitors,
they have evacuation drills.
---
## KRAMER:
I'd rather be
at a drill right now.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:

That shooter
still found his way in,
---
because he was prepared.
---
What do we do to prepare?
---
## SELMA:
Listen to dumb lectures?
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:

Lock the door,
turn off the lights,
---
stay still very, very quiet.
---
We duck under our desks,
cover our heads.
---
## LENORE:
Isn't that what we're supposed
to do?
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:

You don't want
to be a sitting duck.
---
You either run, you hide, or you fight.
---
## WYNN:
Did he just say fight?
## LENORE:
He said fight.
---
## KRAMER:
That's not what he meant.
---
## LENORE:
That's what he said.
## KRAMER:
That's not what he meant.
---
No one would say we should fight back.
---
## SELMA:
That's stupid.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:

How can we make it
harder for the bad guy
---
to come through the door
of our classrooms?
---
## KRAMER:
Lock the door.
---
## LENORE:
Kramer, he's not asking
for audience participation.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:

That's right.
What else?
---
## KRAMER:
Blockade.
---
Get a bunch of desks,
then get under your desk, and pray.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:

Pray?
---
Who told you that?
---
## KRAMER:
Well, that's the only thing
that's going to save you,
---
once he shoots the door down
and moves the desks himself.
---
We're not bulletproof.
---
You're not suggesting we get guns
to protect ourselves, are you?
---
## PRINCIPAL:
Young man, sit down, right now.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:

That's fine.
It's a valid question.
---
What's your name?
## KRAMER:
Kramer.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:

Kramer, come down here.
---
## LENORE:
Don't go down there.
You'll embarrass yourself.
---
## KRAMER:
I don't embarrass easy.
---
How can I help you?
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:

I don't want you
to pray.
---
## KRAMER:
Okay.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:


Not that I'm an atheist,
---
but I would never want you
to just hide your face
---
and pray for divine intervention,
---
not with tragedies
like Parkland happening.
---
You got that?
## KRAMER:
Sure.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:

I want
to make sure you hear me.
---
## KRAMER:
I hear you.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:

Because all the praying
in the world,
---
wishing the bad guy will just go away,
none of that will save you.
---
I want you to be powerful, Kramer.
---
I want you to be a warrior.
---
I am going to show you how to do that.
---
I'm going to show you all how to do that.
---
Okay?
---
## KRAMER:
Okay.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:

I want you to live.
---
## KRAMER:
Me too.
---
Can I go back to my seat now?
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:

Of course.
---
Can we give Kramer a round of applause.
---
[applause]
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:

True story.
---
During the Virginia Tech shootings
in 2007,
---
thirty one students were killed
---
because a professor
---
wouldn't let his students leave
the classroom.
---
The door wouldn't lock,
the shooter came in,
---
shot the professor first,
and then the students.
---
If you have to hide,
you shouldn't just hide,
---
you should be planning
what you are going to do
---
when you have the opportunity
to either escape or fight back.
---
Ladies, if you were being attacked,
---
you would do anything you could
to fight off your attacker, wouldn't you?
---
Now, imagine your attacker has a gun.
---
## PRINCIPAL:
Let's give our guest
a round of applause.
---
Pete, my office.
---
You may all now go back
to your classrooms.
---
Go on.
---
[music]
---
## PRINCIPAL:
You can't do that.
---
You can't just scare them,
it'll freak them out.
---
You don't know these kids.
---
I know these kids.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:


We also can't shelter them
---
from certain realities
of life just because they're children.
---
## PRINCIPAL:
I realize that, but making them
paranoid isn't going to help.
---
These aren't your corporate clients,
they are children, my children.
---
I'm responsible for them,
and I want them to be safe too.
---
Every time I see these reports,
another school, another shooting,
---
you don't think I want them to be safe?
---
You don't think that I want them
to be protected?
---
There has to be another way,
they need more than fear mongering.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:

You're right.
---
## PRINCIPAL:
I am.
---
I'm glad you see it that way.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:

I was just trying
to warn them,
---
because I'm concerned for their safety,
I guess it's the dad in me,
---
but you are right,
---
just scaring them doesn't work.
---
They'll freeze up, or they won't take
me seriously, like my own kids.
---
[laughs]
---
Look who I'm talking to,
I don't need to tell you.
---
I admire how much you care
about your students.
---
How you talk about them as your children,
I wish we had more teachers,
---
more principals looking
after our kids like that,
---
looking after my kids like that.
---
## PRINCIPAL:
I've been doing
this a long time.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:

I know.
---
It must be exhausting,
not to have the support you need.
---
I see the good you do.
I googled you before I came here.
---
## PRINCIPAL:
Same.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:

What did you find out
about me?
---
## PRINCIPAL:
Impressive military background,
you served in Afghanistan,
---
but you didn't go on to law enforcement,
---
which would have been
a natural transition.
---
You started
your own security consulting firm,
---
without a background in security.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:

Impressive, yes,
but it doesn't tell the whole story.
---
Yes, I served for eight years
in the military,
---
but I care about the people
I protect, too.
---
Lives are at stake.
---
You think my methods are too extreme
for your school.
---
## PRINCIPAL:
Well,
we're not training soldiers.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:

But, if I showed them
some techniques I used in my experience,
---
then we wouldn't have to worry
about their safety.
---
More importantly, you wouldn't have
to worry about them either.
---
You’re a woman who has had to fight
just to be taken seriously.
---
## PRINCIPAL:
You don't know me well enough
to make that assessment.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:

I don't need
to know you that well.
---
I've got Google, remember?
---
You turned this school around.
---
Test scores up, dropout rates down.
---
You're considered a real leader.
Respected.
---
It seems the superintendent sees
a successor in you,
---
which is why he recommended
I come to your school first.
---
## PRINCIPAL:
Well, I agree that our students
cannot become complacent.
---
They need to be prepared
for the real world,
---
and that includes arming themselves
with knowledge.
---
Your delivery has to be softened
for high school students.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:

That's why I need you,
Principal Falvey.
---
This program can't be a success
without your cooperation.
---
If it is a success,
---
other schools will look to your example
of how to handle the thorny issue
---
of keeping our kids safe.
---
The real impact
will be that you won't lose any students
---
to a school shooting.
---
## PRINCIPAL:
You can't guarantee that.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:

"You won't know
if you don't try."
---
Isn't that what you said
to the superintendent
---
when he questioned your methods
of revamping the school curriculum?
---
Didn't he think those methods
were extreme?
---
## PRINCIPAL:
Yes, but I--
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:

It's also what you said
to the inner city students you worked
---
with in Southern California.
---
Their success is what brought you here.
---
You know how to create programs
that succeed to keep kids learning.
---
That's all I'm trying to do.
---
I'm just trying to keep them alive.
---
## PRINCIPAL:
We need written consent
from the parents.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:

I have a standard form
I can email you
---
that explains our training methods.
---
## PRINCIPAL:
Speaking of consent,
---
there's something I feel
that I need to address.
---
You were very hands-on with that student
you pulled up on stage.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:

Kramer?
## PRINCIPAL:
Yes, Kramer.
---
I know Kramer quite well.
He's quite the actor.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:

He should enjoy
the role-playing component
---
of the self-defense roles.
## PRINCIPAL:
Self-defense?
---
Does it involve full contact?
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:

No more than sports.
---
Like sports, it's a self-esteem
and team building exercise.
---
When students know
how to defend themselves,
---
they move through the world
with more confidence.
---
The training teaches them how to work
together toward a common purpose.
---
## PRINCIPAL:
Well, our Physical Education
was cut a while back.
---
How much will they exert themselves?
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:

They'll get
their heart rates up, for sure.
---
## PRINCIPAL:
As long as personally,
you do not touch the students.
---
We have strict guidelines
when it comes to physical contact.
---
There has to be verbal consent,
and then even after that--
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:

I know. I know. I know.
It's all in our form, too.
---
Listen,
---
it's a fully-funded program
that benefits students
---
and it fell in your lap.
---
You just need to put your stamp on it.
---
## PRINCIPAL:
Does the superintendent,
he's aware of your methods?
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:

I think
he's seen my safety videos online.
---
That's how he found me,
---
and he sent me to you.
---
## PRINCIPAL:
I'm going to need
a copy of that consent form.
---
[music]
---
## SELMA:
Here.
---
## SELMA'S MOM:

Is this a progress report?
---
## SELMA:
It's for a program
we're doing at school.
---
## SELMA'S STEPDAD:

What's an "active shooter drill"?
---
## SELMA:
It's for school safety.
---
## SELMA'S MOM:
 
"By signing this,
---
I allow my child to participate
in the active shooter drills
---
sponsored by Washington
High School's School Safety Program.
---
The school is bringing
in an outside security company
---
to train our students-"
## SELMA'S STEPDAD:
"-to train our school
---
in important safety measures
such as self-defense."
---
## KRAMER:
It's another opportunity
for me to rehearse my acting.
---
## Kramer's Dad:
It says here you may be
engaged in physical demonstrations.
---
## SELMA'S MOM:

 Self-defense?
---
What exactly is this program?
---
## SELMA:
It'll be good
for college applications.
---
School Safety Officer.
---
## SELMA'S MOM:

Is that what this is about?
---
I don't see anything here about that.
---
## SELMA:
I have strong leadership skills.
---
It's only a matter of time.
---
## LENORE'S DAD:
Then what will you do,
honey?
---
You know you're not good
in stressful situations.
---
## LENORE'S MOM:
You freak out.
---
## LENORE:
I do not freak out.
---
## SELMA'S STEPDAD:
The world is violent.
Isn't it better that Selma's prepared?
---
## SELMA'S MOM:
I don't know.
---
She's only 16.
---
## LENORE'S MOM:
You're only 14,
and the world's a dangerous place.
---
## LENORE:
Maybe I could learn
something then.
---
Isn't it better for me to learn
how to defend myself?
---
## LENORE'S DAD:
If there's a bigger kid,
maybe you can hide behind him.
---
## LENORE'S MOM:
[laughs]
A human shield.
---
That's a great idea.
---
## LENORE'S DAD:
I bet
there'll be some acting involved.
---
Do you like that?
---
## KRAMER'S MOM:
Just don't get hurt, honey.
---
## SELMA'S MOM:

Is it mandatory?
---
## SELMA:
It's not mandatory,
but it is another activity.
---
There's no way an Ivy League school
will reject me,
---
combined with my grades
and the SAT scores.
---
## LENORE'S MOM:
It sounds dangerous.
---
## LENORE:
There won't be any real guns.
---
It'll make me a better actress.
---
## LENORE'S MOM:
Oh, I don't really
think you're the acting type, sweetheart.
---
## SELMA'S STEPDAD:
Do I need
to sign it as well?
---
## SELMA:
There's no place
for stepparents to sign.
---
## LENORE:
You don't think
I could be good at anything.
---
## LENORE'S DAD:
Here we go.
---
## LENORE'S MOM:
Your daughter
doesn't think we love her.
---
## LENORE:
I didn't say that.
---
I don't think you believe in me.
---
## LENORE'S MOM:
This is stupid.
---
## LENORE:
Does that mean
you're not going to sign it?
---
## LENORE'S MOM:
What do you think?
---
## LENORE'S DAD:
I think if we don't sign it,
we're going to look like fools.
---
## LENORE:
Thank you.
---
## LENORE'S MOM:
Maybe this will give
her some self-esteem.
---
## LENORE:
I'm right here.
---
## LENORE'S MOM:
Good.
You need to hear this.
---
## LENORE'S DAD:
It's for the best, honey.
---
We only want what's best for you.
---
[music]
---
## WYNN:
I have something from school
I need you to sign before you go to work.
---
## WYNN'S MOM:
Hold on a moment.
---
Have you seen my keys?
## WYNN:
Where did you leave them?
---
## WYNN'S MOM:
Don't get smart with me.
---
## WYNN:
Did you check your purse?
---
## WYNN'S MOM:
Of course, I did.
---
## WYNN'S MOM:
They were in my purse.
---
All right. What is it?
---
## WYNN:
I need you to sign
this consent form.
---
It's for these active shooter drills
they're starting at the school.
---
## WYNN'S MOM:
What does that even mean?
---
## WYNN:
I don't know, but this guy came
and talked to our school
---
a few weeks ago.
---
## WYNN'S MOM:
Can I do it later?
## WYNN:
No, it's due tomorrow.
---
## WYNN'S MOM:

And you're just not telling me?
---
## WYNN:
Well, I forgot.
---
## WYNN'S MOM:
I'll sign it tomorrow.
## WYNN:
You'll forget.
---
Fine.
---
## WYNN'S MOM:
What's going on with football?
---
Is the coach going to let in more?
---
## WYNN:
I guess.
---
## WYNN'S MOM:
You know I can't take care
of college by myself.
---
You need to do your part.
## WYNN:
What do you think I'm doing?
---
I play. I practice.
I'm freaking studying right now.
---
## WYNN'S MOM:
You say
that like you're doing me a favor.
---
## WYNN:
That's not what I meant.
---
## WYNN'S MOM:
Take off this sweatshirt.
## WYNN:
I'm cold.
---
## WYNN'S MOM:
You've got sweaters.
## WYNN:
I'm not even going out.
---
## WYNN'S MOM:
Doesn't matter.
---
What if you forget and have to go
outside for something?
---
## WYNN:
Okay. I think I can be Black
and wear a hoodie inside my own house
---
without someone shooting me
because I'm threatening.
---
## WYNN'S MOM:
Don't be so sure.
---
Give me the sweatshirt.
I'm going to donate it.
---
## WYNN:
You're going to be late.
---
## WYNN'S MOM:
Fine.
---
Make sure your brother doesn't stay
on the computer too late,
---
and don't go outside.
---
---
[whistle]
---
[gun shot]
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:

This is what a real
gun sounds like.
---
Well, for the most part.
These are blanks, obviously.
---
Don't confuse it with
---
[gun shot]
---
a car backfiring,
---
[gun shot]
---
or a sonic boom,
---
[gun shot]
---
or a book hitting the floor.
---
It's not that, it's
---
[gun shots]--
---
That sound should be permanently imprinted
in your memory.
---
The best time to attack a shooter
who has come into the school
---
or your classroom is when he's unloading.
---
You are in control.
---
Now, I brought a buddy of mine here.
---
We will call him "The Shooter."
---
## WYNN:
That's a woman.
## SELMA:
Yes, that's clearly a woman.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:

You're being rude
to our guest.
---
## KRAMER:
The lady shooter.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:

That's enough.
---
Statistically, most,
if not all, active shooters are men,
---
but for the purposes of this exercise,
this is our shooter.
---
Please welcome her.
---
For these exercises,
we will address the shooter as a man.
---
## WYNN:
Then why isn't "he" a man?
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
Because my normal guy
threw his back out, and my colleague here
---
was available to be the shooter.
---
## SHOOTER:
I'm a black belt.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
Tammy,
you're not supposed to talk.
---
You're just supposed to be the shooter.
The shooter doesn't talk.
---
## SHOOTER:
I thought you said
during the drills,
---
there was going to be some lines
you was going to get me to say.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
Yes, during the drills,
not when I'm introducing you.
---
## SHOOTER:
Sorry.
I was just trying to help.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
That's enough, Tammy.
---
I mean, the shooter.
---
Don't be scared of the shooter.
---
He is wearing a mask
to look imposing and threatening.
---
He has his body padding on
because you're all going to take
---
turns attacking him.
---
You cannot be afraid.
---
As he said, he is a black belt.
---
If this were an actual attack,
---
you would use everything
in your arsenal to protect yourselves,
---
wouldn't you?
---
This is going to be fun.
---
Imagine he is someone who annoys you.
---
## KRAMER:
Like who?
## WYNN:
Like you.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:

That's enough, Wynn.
---
If you want it to be a teacher
or a coach you really hate,
---
I won't tell anyone.
## WYNN:
Oh, he doesn't have any coaches.
---
He's not on any teams. 
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
That's not nice, Wynn.
---
## KRAMER:
No, he's right.
---
I'm not a sports guy,
---
but I'm in Drama Club.
That's kind of like a team,
---
and the guy in charge
of that is kind of annoying.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:

Use that then.
## WYNN:
Can it be a parent?
---
Even if you don't hate them,
you're just really frustrated with them?
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
If it helps.
---
## SELMA:
Can he be someone
that we're scared of?
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:

Just as long
as your fear doesn't cause
---
you to freeze up,
but Selma makes a good point.
---
This is a great opportunity
to face your fear.
---
If you can conquer your fear,
you can do anything.
---
He could be anyone,
---
someone you trust,
and that is what they bank on,
---
the guise of familiarity
to keep you off-guard,
---
and when you're off-guard,
they will strike to kill.
---
All right, enough talking.
---
I need a volunteer.
---
Lenore, you raised your hand before.
---
## LENORE:
That was to ask a question
that you never let me ask.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
Come on.
This will be good for you.
---
Come a little closer.
I'm not going to hurt you.
---
He might,
---
but that's why we're here for.
---
We're going to make sure
he doesn't hurt you.
---
We'll make sure no one's going
to hurt you ever.
---
You'll hurt him.
Okay?
---
## LENORE:
I don't want to hurt him.
---
Especially because he's her.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:

You can do this.
## LENORE:
Do I have to?
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
Yes.
---
Active Shooters, like dogs, wolves,
and horses, can smell your fear.
---
You have to be certain you can do this,
Lenore.
---
Are you certain?
---
## LENORE:
Yes.
---
Yes, I think so.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
All right.
We'll go with that.
---
I want you to come at Lenore,
---
like you're going
to tear her limb from limb.
---
## LENORE:
Are we just jumping into this?
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:

Let's get right
into it. I know you can do it.
---
Ready?
---
Go.
---
## WYNN:
Come on, Lenore.
## KRAMER:
You've got this.
---
## SHOOTER:
Ow.
## LENORE:
Oh, did I?
---
## SHOOTER:
Bang, you're dead.
---
## KRAMER:
I almost--
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
That's not good enough.
---
## SHOOTER:
Bam, bam, bam.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
Now you're all dead too.
---
School's out.
---
She'll be okay.
---
Okay.
---
Who's next?
---
## LENORE:
Let me try again.
---
[music]
---
---
[crickets]
---
## SELMA'S MOM:
Selma?
---
Selma.
---
Selma, wake up.
---
## SELMA:
What's the matter?
---
## SELMA'S MOM:
I heard a strange,
did you hear that?
---
## SELMA:
All I heard was you waking me up.
I have a math test tomorrow.
---
## SELMA'S MOM:
There was a strange
noise outside.
---
Your stepfather went to investigate.
---
## SELMA:
He went to investigate?
What?
---
## SELMA'S MOM:
The noise we heard outside.
Aren't you listening?
---
## SELMA:
I'm barely awake.
---
Is he okay going out there alone?
---
## SELMA'S MOM:
He's got his gun with him.
## SELMA:
His gun?
---
He's got a gun in the house?
## SELMA'S MOM:
For protection.
---
I don't mean to scare you.
---
## SELMA:
It's too late now.
---
## SELMA'S MOM:
This is just
how it was when you were a kid.
---
I never felt unsafe with your father.
## SELMA:
And now?
---
## SELMA'S MOM:
At least he's got a gun,
it makes me feel better.
---
Your father didn't need a gun.
---
[gun shot]
---
## SELMA:
Oh shit.
---
## SELMA'S MOM:
What the hell was that?
## SELMA:
I don't know.
---
How would I know that?
## SELMA'S MOM:
Don't panic.
---
I'm sure he's fine.
## SELMA:
I'm not panicking.
---
## SELMA'S MOM:
You're shaking.
## SELMA:
Well, you're taking all the covers.
---
[noise]
---
What was that?
---
[creaking]
---
Is someone there?
---
Hello?
---
Fuck.
## SELMA'S MOM:
 Oh thank God.
---
Glenn, why didn't you announce yourself?
---
## SELMA'S STEPDAD:
To who?
An empty house?
---
## SELMA'S MOM:
 Us.
We thought maybe you had been shot.
---
## SELMA'S STEPDAD:
By who?
## SELMA'S MOM:
 By whoever is out there.
---
## SELMA'S STEPDAD:
Oh, I'm sorry.
---
## SELMA:
What was it?
---
## SELMA'S STEPDAD:
I don't know,
but whoever or whatever it was,
---
it's gone now.
---
We're safe.
## SELMA:
Then why did you shoot your gun?
---
## SELMA'S STEPDAD:
Warning shot.
## SELMA:
Oh my God,
---
but what if they felt threatened
and shot at you?
---
## SELMA'S STEPDAD:
But they didn't.
---
## SELMA:
But--
## SELMA'S MOM:
 It didn't, it didn't, okay?
---
He's fine.
---
## SELMA:
I know,
but it so easily could have--
---
## SELMA'S MOM:
 Enough.
---
Go to bed.
Okay?
---
---
---
[whistle]
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
In the event
of an active shooter attack,
---
you need to use anything
at your disposal to defend yourselves.
---
If it's a stapler, a computer,
a backpack, a chair,
---
anything that will distract the shooter.
---
For today's demonstration,
we are going to use tennis balls.
---
When the shooter comes through the door,
you are going to pelt him with them.
---
Then two of you are going to go in,
---
jump the active shooter
and wrestle him to the ground,
---
grab his gun.
---
Then you're going to all dog pile on him
and sit on him until the police arrive.
---
Can you do that?
---
Any two volunteers?
---
Great.
---
You two, you are going to be my jumpers.
---
## LENORE:
Jumpers?
## SELMA:
That sounds dangerous.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:

Nothing
is dangerous if you're well trained.
---
## SELMA:
You want us
to just jump the shooter?
---
## LENORE:
Why us?
## WYNN:
You know,
---
I'd be more than happy to be a jumper.
---
## SELMA:
I'm fine with that.
## LENORE:
I want to jump.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:

No,
I have a bigger job for you,
---
but no less important.
You are going to be my shooter.
---
## WYNN:
What happened to your friend,
the lady shooter?
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:

She had to cancel
on me at the last minute,
---
but mainly I think we need a male.
---
## KRAMER:
Wait a minute.
---
I'm perfectly capable
of being the shooter.
---
## WYNN:
Speaking of a lady shooter.
---
## KRAMER:
No, I've been working out.
---
Tell them.
---
## WYNN:
Sure.
Yes, you've been working out,
---
but shooters aren't losers
from the Drama Club.
---
No offense.
## SELMA:
Actually,
---
if this were real,
Kramer is the exact demographic,
---
an outcast.
---
He wouldn't need to be big
or strong or much of a man, really.
---
Because he would have a gun.
## KRAMER:
I am not an outcast or a loser,
---
or a lady.
---
## SELMA:
It's not an insult.
---
In reality, I'm a bigger outcast than you.
---
I'm a person of color.
---
I'm a woman, and I'm smart.
---
I'm a unicorn.
---
Doesn't that make me
the perfect shooter?
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
I’m letting
you be one of the jumpers.
---
## SELMA:
Letting.
---
Why? Because women
are usually victims?
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
You're not a victim
if you fight back.
---
## LENORE:
I'm happy to show you
what I've learned.
---
## SELMA:
I don't know
why he gets all the power.
---
## WYNN:
Just get off of your soapbox
and let the guys take this one.
---
Okay? It's safer.
---
## LENORE:
He doesn't have all the power.
---
## SELMA:
It takes two of us
to tackle one of him.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
He may have one weapon,
but you have eight,
---
two hands, two elbows,
two knees, two feet.
---
Between the two of you,
you have 16 weapons.
---
Can we get this started?
I've got a lot of ground to cover.
---
One other thing we need to make sure
of is that you are not in his line
---
of fire so that when he comes
through the door,
---
he tries to shoot directly in front
of him, he won't see anything.
---
He'll be disoriented.
---
He'll miss things for a split second.
---
Then our two brave soldiers can jump.
---
## WYNN:
Wait, should I be listening
to all this?
---
I'm learning all of your plans.
I could use that against you.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
It's fine.
---
Turn your shooter ears off
and your potential victims' ears on.
---
See?
Boys can be victims too.
---
Remember, ladies,
---
you do not want to be anywhere
near that gun.
---
If he sees you first,
when he gets an open shot,
---
he will kill you.
---
Should we go for it?
## KRAMER:
What do I do?
---
They all have very important roles.
---
The shooter, jumpers.
---
What am I?
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
You're everyone else.
---
## KRAMER:
Excuse me, sir,
but I'm not used to being in the chorus.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
Well,
now you can be the whole chorus.
---
## KRAMER:
The leader?
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
Sure.
---
## KRAMER:
Like a dance captain.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
What's that?
---
## LENORE:
Just end the suffering now
and say yes.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
Kramer,
you will stand back here.
---
When the shooter comes in,
you will pelt him
---
with your tennis balls
when you get the chance.
---
The jumpers will be going off of your cue.
---
When you're pelting him,
that is their signal
---
that it's time to bring him down.
---
You have a very important job,
dance captain.
---
Ladies, positions.
## WYNN:
What about me?
---
What are my instructions?
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
I will shut the door.
You will wait in the hall.
---
I will knock on the door three times.
You will come in with your gun.
---
You'll be looking for people to shoot.
---
Do not worry, this is just a replica.
---
It's just meant to look threatening.
It does not actually work.
---
Tennis balls will be coming at you.
Use your hands to block your face.
---
When the girls jump on you,
let them take you gently to the ground.
---
Safety first.
## WYNN:
Wait, but if I was a real shooter,
---
wouldn't I be fighting them off?
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
That's true,
but for the sake of this exercise--
---
## WYNN:
I thought this exercise
was supposed to be as realistic
---
as possible to prepare us?
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
I don't want you
to hurt anyone.
---
Just go down and stay down
when they dog pile on you.
---
## WYNN:
Shouldn't I have padding
if they're going to tackle
---
and dog pile on me?
I have pads for football.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
My other guy
had all that stuff.
---
Go easy on this guy,
especially you ladies.
---
## SELMA:
We are supposed to tackle him.
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
Tackle him gently.
---
## SELMA:
That doesn't even make any sense.
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
Who's in charge here?
---
Any other questions?
## WYNN:
Shouldn't we at least run it once.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
I've got a lot
of material left to cover, bud.
---
You'll be fine.
---
Let's turn off the lights to add
to the active shooter's disorientation.
---
## KRAMER:
Now.
---
[screams and grunts]
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
Everyone off.
---
How'd that feel?
---
[music]
---
## PRINCIPAL:
Well, I've heard
from some parents,
---
the students are going home telling
their folks about what's going on.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
Come on,
you're used to a little pushback.
---
## PRINCIPAL:
They're threatening
to speak to the superintendent.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
They don't understand
the gravity of the situation.
---
You need to explain it to them.
## PRINCIPAL:
I tried.
---
All they hear is tennis balls
and shots fired.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
Blanks.
---
## PRINCIPAL:
You have to understand
that to them, that sounds
---
more dangerous than an actual shooting.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
If something
actually happens at this school,
---
those same parents are going to march
into this office wondering
---
why you are not doing more
to save their children.
---
## PRINCIPAL:
What can we do
to help them understand that?
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
Maybe we could have
a Q&A and address their concern.
---
After all, I'm a parent.
---
## PRINCIPAL:
I don't think you talking to them
directly is the best idea.
---
You're aggressive. Maybe we can put
together a little presentation.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
What about a demo?
---
Then they would see the training's
not as scary as they think it is.
---
## PRINCIPAL:
You can't have
the students tackling each other.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
That defeats
the purpose of a demonstration.
---
## PRINCIPAL:
We have to get to the heart
of why we're doing this.
---
Their children's safety,
that's all that matters.
---
If you can get the parents
to understand that, they'll be on board.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
What if we do a play?
---
## PRINCIPAL:
A play?
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
We need
to speak to their emotions
---
so they're not distracted by our methods.
---
Most parents love to see
their kids in plays.
---
I bet you Kramer would do it,
and he could convince the others.
---
## PRINCIPAL:
Well, our arts budget
got cut to pay for you.
---
Maybe this will remind the parents
why the arts are important.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
Hopefully
that'll translate to a big turnout.
---
## PRINCIPAL:
What do you know
about writing a play?
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
[laughs]
Nothing.
---
I wouldn't even know
how to charge you for it.
---
What if you write the play?
---
## PRINCIPAL:
I've never written a play before,
---
but I can't afford
to lose anymore programs
---
for you to write one either.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
You're the perfect
person to write this play.
---
You know the community,
you know what these parents need
---
to hear to get them on board.
---
## PRINCIPAL:
All the parents want to hear
is that we're keeping their kids safe.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
That's a clear message.
A great place to start.
---
Just make sure you're making it exciting,
---
otherwise they're not going
to hear the message.
---
## PRINCIPAL:
You want me to explain
how threatening an active shooter is,
---
and make it exciting?
---
With what?
Pyrotechnics?
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
No.
Emotions, speak from the heart.
---
They have to believe
that this could happen here.
---
They think that this could only happen
to someone else, somewhere else.
---
They're never going to get it.
---
It can't just be a new story.
---
## PRINCIPAL:
I don't know
if I can be that persuasive.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
You've got
a great message.
---
Keep our kids safe.
---
Let me ask you this,
---
when it comes to school safety,
what is your biggest fear?
---
## PRINCIPAL:
I'm worried about
what happens if I don't do something.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
So are they.
---
You've got this.
---
If you need it, I'm always here to help.
---
I know a thing or two
about getting a message across,
---
and I won't even charge you for it.
---
## PRINCIPAL:
I guess I better get
to writing that play. Huh?
---
[bell rings]
---
[grunts]
---
## KRAMER:
Would you look at that?
---
## WYNN:
Bro, I'm trying to concentrate.
---
## KRAMER:
I'm a "bro" now?
Wow, we have gotten close.
---
## WYNN:
Shut up.
---
## KRAMER:
I'm talking,
---
and somehow,
---
I'm also lifting
---
the exact same weight as you.
---
## WYNN:
That makes you my equal
or something?
---
## KRAMER:
Well, at least your equal.
---
I'm practically straight now
with all this lifting.
---
## WYNN:
You're practically straight
like I'm practically a Rhoades scholar.
---
## KRAMER:
You said it, not me.
Switch.
---
Is this why we come this late,
so that you don't have to be seen with me?
---
## WYNN:
Oh, are we talking now?
---
Like girlfriends?
## KRAMER:
Just keep my legs in the air.
---
Shut up.
---
I'm getting strong.
---
## WYNN:
You like to validate yourself a lot.
---
## KRAMER:
Blame my parents.
---
## WYNN:
Are they proud
of everything you do?
---
Like being gay?
---
## KRAMER:
They talk about all
of my achievements all of the time.
---
## WYNN:
Being gay's not an achievement.
---
It's like me saying being tall
is an achievement.
---
## KRAMER:
My parents would consider
being tall an achievement.
---
They're rather militant about it.
---
They think if they show the slightest
amount of disappointment in me,
---
then I won't have the strength
---
to venture out
into the world with confidence.
---
They're just as uncomfortable
with me being gay as you are.
---
## WYNN:
I'm not uncomfortable.
---
## KRAMER:
Sure you are.
---
## WYNN:
Just because you're proud
and confident and gay
---
doesn't mean you know everything.
## KRAMER:
Oh, it doesn't?
---
Switch.
---
## WYNN:
Oh, so you think cause you're gay,
you're so smart?
---
## KRAMER:
Gays aren't as naturally manly
as you, which means that all of our brains
---
go to our brains instead of our muscles.
---
## WYNN:
Oh, is that a scientific fact?
---
## KRAMER:
You can figure
that one out for yourself, Wynn.
---
Come on, use your muscles.
---
## WYNN:
You know, I almost like you.
---
Do all gay guys at our school
try to be this funny?
---
## KRAMER:
I wouldn't know.
---
Most gays stay away from me
because I'm the gayest, apparently.
---
## WYNN:
Must be lonely.
---
## KRAMER:
I have friends.
## WYNN:
Yes, girls.
---
That's kind of a waste.
You're not going to fuck any of them.
---
## KRAMER:
I've motorboated a few,
just for fun.
---
## WYNN:
See? Now that's unfair.
---
I wish I could just walk up
to a girl and--
---
## KRAMER:
Concentrate on the dips.
---
I didn't get boner or anything?
---
## WYNN:
I would have been hard as a rock.
---
## KRAMER:
Now you know
what gym showers are like for me.
---
## WYNN:
Have you ever noticed
how quiet it is in here?
---
## KRAMER:
Switch.
---
[silence]
---
What was that?
---
## WYNN:
Just for fun.
---
I didn't get a boner or anything.
---
Oh, are you getting feelings
about this now?
---
## KRAMER:
I'm not getting feelings
about anything.
---
## WYNN:
That wasn't horrible.
---
## KRAMER:
Thanks.
## WYNN:
That wasn't an insult.
---
## KRAMER:
Well, try being on this end of it.
---
## WYNN:
It's about getting closer
to another guy, right?
---
## KRAMER:
Not everything is about conquest.
---
## WYNN:
Who's making assumptions now?
---
## KRAMER:
Everybody knows
that's why straight guys work out,
---
so that they can be protective
over their women,
---
maintaining the patriarchy.
## WYNN:
Oh, is that why we work out?
---
See, no one told me.
I just like the way I look in t-shirts.
---
## KRAMER:
We're not all that different
from each other.
---
You're just a few steps away.
---
## WYNN:
Okay, look,
---
trying to turn me can't be the only reason
that you work out.
---
There's nothing wrong
with maintaining the patriarchy,
---
or trying to protect your loved ones.
---
## KRAMER:
Let's just say I understand
you better than I thought I would.
---
Do you feel closer to me?
## WYNN:
That's a loaded question.
---
Thanks dude.
---
Now I know I don't like kissing dudes.
---
Check that one off the list.
---
## KRAMER:
Well, I hate motorboating.
## WYNN:
Check-check.
---
## KRAMER:
I want to get out of here.
---
## WYNN:
Look, I wasn't trying
to reject you, but you had--
---
## KRAMER:
I mean this town.
---
It's so fucking small.
---
## WYNN:
Yes.
---
I'm going to the NFL.
---
After seven years,
I'll retire and maybe act,
---
like the Rock or Terry Crews.
---
## KRAMER:
I'm going to New York.
---
Skipping the NFL.
---
## WYNN:
Like you'd turn down
the opportunity to be in those showers.
---
## KRAMER:
Just because you kissed me,
---
don't think that means that you know me.
---
[bell rings]
---
[background conversations]
---
## KRAMER:
Sometime a few minutes
before 9:30 AM,
---
Adam Lanza pulls out of his driveway.
---
The general belief is that he originally
intended to go to the local high school.
---
## LENORE:
But two police cars
that happened to be in the driveway
---
of the school stopped him.
He kept driving down the road.
---
[cough]
---
## WYNN:
Surveillance footage
from the high school shows
---
his car circling the school parking lot.
---
## SELMA:
By 9:34,
---
he was at the front entrance
of Sandy Hook Elementary.
---
He was a student there,
so he knew the schedule.
---
Students would already be in class,
and no one would be wandering the halls.
---
## KRAMER:
Visitors were required
to ring the doorbell before entering.
---
## LENORE:
Security cameras were outside
the school's main entrance.
---
## WYNN:
Lanza shot
through the plate glass window
---
to the right of the door eight times
with his rifle.
---
[shots]
---
## SELMA:
In less than a second, he was in.
---
## KRAMER:
What was that?
## LENORE:
Did you hear that?
---
## SELMA:
That's strange.
## WYNN:
Gunshots?
---
## ALL:
Lockdown.
---
## KRAMER:
Shooter.
[shots]
---
## LENORE:
One.
## KRAMER:
Two.
---
## LENORE:
The door won't lock.
---
## KRAMER & LENORE:
[shots]
Three.
---
## KRAMER:
[shots]
Four.
---
## LENORE:
[shots]
Five, six, seven.
---
## KRAMER:
[shots]
eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve.
---
## LENORE:
[shots]
thirteen, fourteen
---
## KRAMER & LENORE:
[shots]
fifteen, sixteen.
---
## KRAMER:
[shots]
All in 38 seconds.
---
## LENORE:
Every Fall, usually,
---
there were scheduled
annual evacuation drills,
---
complete with orange cones.
---
## SELMA:
What was that?
## WYNN:
Shh.
---
## KRAMER:
Turn the lights out.
---
## LENORE:
What do we do now?
---
## SELMA:
Pray.
## WYNN:
I hear gunshots.
---
## KRAMER:
Let's sing Christmas carols.
---
It's almost Christmas.
---
Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells,
Jingle all the way.
---
## ALL:
Oh what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse open sleigh.
---
[gun shot]
---
## KRAMER:
Dashing through the snow.
---
## KRAMER & WYNN:
In a one-horse open sleigh.
---
## KRAMER & WYNN & LENORE:
Over the fields we go.
---
## ALL:
Laughing all the way.
---
[gun shots]
---
## WYNN:
You're shaking.
---
## LENORE:
Why are we here for so long?
---
I have to pee.
## KRAMER:
It won't be long now.
---
Hold hands.
---
Several times a year.
---
## LENORE:
They had lockdown drills.
---
## KRAMER:
I want to go home.
---
## WYNN:
Police sirens in the distance.
---
## LENORE:
9:38.
## WYNN:
The sound of a door opening.
---
## LENORE:
I love you.
---
[gun shot]
---
## KRAMER:
seventeen.
---
[gun shot]
---
## LENORE:
eighteen.
---
## KRAMER:
Lanza's rifle jammed
for a few short seconds.
---
Run.
---
[gun shot]
---
## LENORE:
Four of them ran past him
as he was trying to unjam his rifle.
---
[gun shot]
---
## KRAMER:
nineteen.
---
[gun shot]
---
## LENORE:
twenty, twenty-one.
## KRAMER:
twenty-two, twenty-three.
---
## LENORE:
twenty-four.
---
## KRAMER & LENORE:
twenty five, twenty six.
---
## LENORE:
9:40 AM.
---
five minutes, six adults,
twenty children
---
[gun shot]
---
It's over.
---
## KRAMER:
Eventually, parents
are allowed to find their children.
---
## LENORE:
Some of them do.
---
## KRAMER:
Those that do,
say the same thing.
---
## LENORE:
Thank God.
## KRAMER:
Are you okay?
---
## LENORE:
Where?
## KRAMER:
Thank God.
---
## LENORE:
Have you seen?
## KRAMER:
Where?
---
## LENORE:
I love you.
## KRAMER:
Have you seen?
---
## LENORE:
Oh God.
## KRAMER:
I love you.
---
## LENORE:
I prayed.
---
## KRAMER:
I prayed.
## LENORE:
I love you.
---
## KRAMER:
I love you.
## LENORE:
I love you.
---
## KRAMER:
I love you.
## LENORE:
I love you.
---
## KRAMER:
I love you.
## LENORE:
Your mommy loves you.
---
## KRAMER:
Your mommy loves you.
## LENORE:
Your daddy loves you.
---
## KRAMER:
Your daddy loves you.
## LENORE:
We love you.
---
## KRAMER:
We love you.
## LENORE:
Are you okay?
---
## KRAMER:
I love you.
---
## LENORE:
Thank God.
## WYNN:
Have you seen.
---
## LENORE:
I love you.
## KRAMER:
Oh, God.
---
Okay. I love you.
## WYNN:
I love you.
---
## SELMA:
Have you seen.
## KRAMER:
Okay. I love you.
---
## WYNN:
I love you.
## KRAMER:
Oh, God. I love you.
---
Your mommy loves you.
Your daddy loves you.

We love you.
I love you.

I love you.

Thank God.
## SELMA:
Your mommy loves you.

Your daddy loves you.

## SAFETY CONSULTANT:

Keep our kids safe.
---
Keep our kids safe.
---
## MORE VOICES:
Keep our kids safe.
---
Keep our kids safe.
---
Keep our kids safe.
---
## PRINCIPAL:
Attention students.
---
We are sending home a letter explaining
our new school safety procedures,
---
which have been funded
by the school district,
---
making Washington High School
the first school in the state
---
to participate in a fully funded active
shooter drill program.
---
So let's show our school pride
with our full attention and engagement.
---
Also, the school musical
has been cancelled.
---
[bell ring]
---
[music]
---
[intermission]
---
---
[bell]
---
## PRINCIPAL:
Is this really necessary?
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
I spent months working
on the details
---
of this pilot re-enactment drill.
I know what I'm doing.
---
Plus, the parents are on board now,
thanks to you.
---
If this gets added
to the school safety program,
---
there's no stopping what we can do.
---
Schools everywhere will implement
this program specifically.
---
## PRINCIPAL:
I was talking
about the light switch, specifically.
---
Do we really need to turn the lights off?
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
Students need to be
prepared for unexpected things to happen.
---
Like, the active shooter cuts off
the power,
---
or you make your way
to the main power source
---
and you cut off the power to keep
the active shooter off his game.
---
Today's re-enactment scenario is,
---
what happens when there's an active
shooter on the loose?
---
This is an excellent opportunity
for our students to utilize the skills
---
they've built up over the past few months.
---
## PRINCIPAL:
But you're forgetting to take
something into consideration.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
What's that?
---
## PRINCIPAL:
Hormones.
---
What do you think is going to happen
when all the lights go off?
---
What do you think their first response
is going to be?
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
They've been trained
to assess the situation.
---
## PRINCIPAL:
Making out and oral sex.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
Should we make an announcement?
---
## PRINCIPAL:
Like what?
---
"Students, please refrain from giving
or receiving blow jobs?"
---
Be my guest.
---
## PRINCIPAL:
And what if someone gets hurt?
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
Giving or receiving blow jobs?
---
## PRINCIPAL:
Tripping over a chair,
or another student.
---
You can't see much when it's dark,
and I'm worried about liability.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
See,
that's the difference between us.
---
You think about
these little minute details,
---
while I'm thinking
about the bigger picture.
---
What about the liability of deaths
you could have prevented
---
if your students were prepared
for anything?
---
## PRINCIPAL:
Are they prepared for anything?
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
We're about to find out.
---
That's why they call it a drill.
---
Time is wasting.
You've got to pull the trigger.
---
## PRINCIPAL:
Can't you pull the trigger?
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
Not legally.
---
To make a difference,
you've need to pull the trigger.
---
## PRINCIPAL:
Now?
---
[music]
---
## SELMA:
What are you doing?
---
Let's get out of here.
---
## LENORE:
I want to find him.
---
Test out what I've learned.
---
## SELMA:
You shouldn't go looking for
trouble.
---
## LENORE:
If I can overtake him now,
---
then I'll know I'm capable.
## SELMA:
And if you're not?
---
## LENORE:
Then I'll know
what I need to work on.
---
Are you going to help me or not?
---
Two against one.
---
## SELMA:
Two against two.
He's got a gun.
---
## LENORE:
What are you afraid of?
---
If anything, the more we know
what we're capable of,
---
the less afraid we'll be.
---
## SELMA:
You're starting to sound
like the Safety Consultant.
---
## LENORE:
And you're beginning
to sound scared.
---
I think we should split up.
---
## SELMA:
Why?
---
## LENORE:
I think I have a better chance
at survival.
---
Good luck.
---
## SELMA:
What am I going to do now?
---
## WYNN:
You could stick with me.
## SELMA:
I give up.
---
## WYNN:
Turn around,
I'm not the shooter.
---
## SELMA:
Damn.
## WYNN:
Disappointed?
---
## SELMA:
I just want this to be over with.
---
Maybe I should just go
and offer myself up to the shooter.
---
## WYNN:
No, you don't want to do that.
---
These aren't just drills, Selma.
They're life lessons.
---
How we perform in these drills
---
is how we're going
to perform in real life.
---
## SELMA:
Where did you get that?
Some football movie?
---
## WYNN:
Be a quitter.
---
It's cool.
---
## SELMA:
Oh, I get it. It's some sort
of reverse psychology tactic
---
that you learned playing sports.
## WYNN:
No.
---
I just can't care
about you more than you do.
---
## SELMA:
I should go find the Shooter.
---
## WYNN:
Wait, no, shit.
---
Selma. I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have said that.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
Boom, you're shot.
---
## WYNN:
Oh shit.
---
That's it?
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
Yes.
---
Took you down faster than I thought,
big football player like yourself.
---
Report to the triage station to have
your bullet wounds and fake blood applied.
---
## WYNN:
This sucks.
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
I shot you in the back.
---
Make sure that's where they apply
the bullet wounds.
---
## WYNN:
Okay.
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
Hey,
---
I saw you talking to someone else.
Where did she go?
---
## WYNN:
I can't help you.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
I know.
It's against the rules,
---
but it will make the drill go by faster.
---
## WYNN:
I can't help you because I'm dead.
---
## SELMA:
Kramer.
## KRAMER:
Selma.
---
You're still alive.
---
## SELMA:
He got Wynn.
I saw it.
---
I was hiding when it happened.
---
## KRAMER:
Do you think
we're the only ones left?
---
## SELMA:
How would I know that?
## KRAMER:
I don't know.
---
I just think it would be cool
if we're the last survivors.
---
It would mean we are the strongest.
---
Are you okay?
---
## SELMA:
Are you afraid of anything?
---
## KRAMER:
Yes.
---
I'm afraid of not being the person
I'm meant to be.
---
## SELMA:
I'm talking about something real.
---
## KRAMER:
Like snakes?
---
## SELMA:
Why isn't this locked,
or barricaded?
---
## KRAMER:
I forgot.
I've been thinking.
---
## SELMA:
About the person
you're meant to be?
---
## KRAMER:
Let's not fight.
---
Especially if we're the last
two people left alive.
---
## SELMA:
Don't say that.
---
Is it healthy to always feel unsafe?
## KRAMER:
I don't hear anything.
---
Do you think that means the drill is over?
---
## SELMA:
I think we're supposed
to hear something.
---
Like a bell or an alarm.
---
## KRAMER:
We've been here for a long time,
or it seems like a long time.
---
## SELMA:
I think the Principal
is supposed to make an announcement.
---
## KRAMER:
I haven't heard anything
for a while.
---
You think we'd be able to hear something,
like footsteps, anything.
---
Maybe I should go out there.
---
## SELMA:
I'm going to stay
here where it's safe.
---
## KRAMER:
But it's not.
---
## SELMA:
Don't worry.
---
I am going to lock and barricade
the door behind you.
---
## KRAMER:
You should come with me,
that way,
---
if we see the shooter our odds
of getting him will be greater.
---
Two against one.
---
Your choice.
---
Lock the door.
Lock the door.
---
## SELMA:
No.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:

Ow.
## SELMA:
I'm not letting you in.
---
Drop the gun.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:

For real.
My arm is stuck.
---
Let me out and I swear I won't shoot you.
---
## SELMA:
Nice try.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:

I'm serious, Selma.
---
## SELMA:
I wouldn't if you were really
the Shooter.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:

But my arm
is really stuck.
---
You're hurting me.
---
Hello?
---
Is anyone out there?
Hello?
---
Help.
---
Help.
---
Why didn't I choose a safe word?
---
## SELMA:
I'm sorry about this,
but I'm just following the rules.
---
I'm sure someone will come around
and end the drill soon.
---
Especially since the shooter
has been caught.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:

I'm supposed to end
the drill.
---
## SELMA:
Why?
---
Because there aren't supposed
to be any survivors?
---
What happens if the shooter
dies during the drill?
---
You haven't thought about that,
have you?
---
Have you?
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
No.
---
## SELMA:
Does that feel better?
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:

Yes. A bit. Oh fuck.
---
What did you do that for?
---
## SELMA:
Because you think
we're all going to die.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:

That's not true.
---
## SELMA:
Then stop pushing on the door.
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:

You're hurting me.
---
## SELMA:
I thought that was the point
of the drill.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
Don't worry.
I'm not going to hurt you.
---
Oh, you did a pretty good job on my arm.
---
It's going to leave a mark.
---
## SELMA:
Don't hurt me.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
I'm not going to do anything.
---
## SELMA:
Stop coming closer.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
I just want
to make sure you're okay.
---
## SELMA:
I am fine.
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
You're not fine.
---
I can see it on your face.
---
Selma, stop.
---
I'm not going to hurt you.
---
## SELMA:
I don't believe you.
---
How do I know this isn't part
of the drill?
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:

The drill is over.
---
Stop.
---
You're not in danger.
---
## SELMA:
Then stop chasing me.
---
Let me go.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:

You can't go like this.
---
## SELMA:
Let go of me.
You said I was safe.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
You are.
---
I just want to make sure you calm down
before I let go of you.
---
## SELMA:
Why?
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
Because you're going
to get me in trouble.
---
## SELMA:
Maybe that's a good thing.
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
Shh.
---
Calm down.
## SELMA:
Let go of me.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
Okay.
You just got scared.
---
## SELMA:
Please let go of me.
---
Please.
---
[sobbing]
---
Will you please just tell the principal
that the drill is over now?
---
[sobbing]
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
Okay.
---
[bell rings]
---
## PRINCIPAL:
The drill is over.
---
The scheduled talkback with the safety
consultant has been postponed.
---
Thank you for your participation.
---
## WYNN:
Selma, you in here?
---
## SELMA:
Yes.
---
## WYNN:
Pete, sent me in here to get you.
---
## SELMA:
Who?
## WYNN:
The safety guy.
---
## SELMA:
I'm fine.
---
## WYNN:
You don't sound it or look it.
---
## SELMA:
Thanks.
---
What happened to you?
---
## WYNN:
Oh, shot in the back.
---
## SELMA:
I remember.
---
It's better if you go.
---
## WYNN:
Oh, they can't release us
until we're all accounted for.
---
## SELMA:
You see?
---
You're not here because you care.
You're just here to complete roll call.
---
## WYNN:
What did you do?
---
They had to ice Pete's his arm.
## SELMA:
I don't want to talk about it.
---
## WYNN:
Okay.
---
Is there room for me under that desk?
---
Just to sit,
we don't have to don't to talk.
---
## SELMA:
Don't get any ideas.
---
## WYNN:
I'm sorry you were so scared.
---
Pete said that he didn't mean it.
## SELMA:
Fine.
---
## WYNN:
What?
You said you were fine?
---
## SELMA:
You said we don't have to talk.
---
Just stop talking.
Get under the desk.
---
Don't look at me.
---
Don't touch me either.
---
Just sit there.
---
[music]
---
## PRINCIPAL:
What did you do?
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:

The rest
of the drill went on without a hitch.
---
## PRINCIPAL:
This is too dangerous.
I knew I should have never.
---
You traumatized that student.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:

A person
won't become traumatized by a simulation.
---
There has to be past trauma.
---
## PRINCIPAL:
You're saying
this is her fault?
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:

I'm just saying
we can't hold ourselves responsible.
---
## PRINCIPAL:
Oh, I'm not responsible.
---
You're exposing these children
to violence in order to protect them?
---
This has gotten out of hand.
---
I'm bringing the superintendent
into this conversation.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:

Make sure
you tell him you flipped the light switch.
---
## PRINCIPAL:
I had to legally.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:

You could have said no.
---
## PRINCIPAL:
I objected.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:

Did you say no?
---
It's an easy word to say.
See how easy that could have been?
---
## PRINCIPAL:
You're not going to lay
this on me.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:

I don't have to.
---
I'm an independent contractor.
---
All that happens to me
is my contract gets canceled.
---
## PRINCIPAL:
These were your methods.
---
You're liable.
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:

You signed a contract.
---
In order for methods to be implemented,
they need to be approved.
---
Plus, you wrote
the Sandy Hook presentation
---
## PRINCIPAL:
Because you said
you couldn't write a play.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:


I'm sure the superintendent
---
would understand if you disapproved
and raised objections,
---
but you participated in helping me
execute my curriculum.
---
Logically speaking,
---
you must have approved enough
to put your objections aside.
---
## PRINCIPAL:
You're going to throw me
under the bus and make this all my fault?
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
Only if you strike first.
---
Tell the superintendent that the drills
---
have helped so many students
protect themselves,
---
and that you recommend
he start implementing the active shooter
---
training program, district wide.
---
That way, it's a win-win for both of us.
---
## PRINCIPAL:
I can't do that.
---
What if more students are traumatized?
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
What is your conscience
going to tell you
---
when you read a news report of a school
shooting you could have prevented?
---
## PRINCIPAL:
Oh, you can't lay that on me.
I'm just one person.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:

You're just one woman.
---
How long do you think it will take you
to do this much good,
---
climbing a ladder one rung
at a time if you even get there?
---
Don't throw everything away
for one small incident.
---
You need to start thinking
about the bigger picture.
---
## PRINCIPAL:
I still believe in the system.
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
Why?
---
The system doesn't believe in you.
---
You got your programs cut.
---
Then the superintendent hands you
this high-risk program and if it fails,
---
which he figures is likely,
you will take the fault.
---
You have to make sure this doesn't fail.
---
## PRINCIPAL:
By breaking the rules.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
The rules are fixed.
---
The only way to win
is to make your own rules.
---
You could be a real force behind making
this state schools safer.
---
## PRINCIPAL:
If I'm going to do this,
---
I don't want it
to just be a statewide program.
---
I want it to go national.
---
Me and you, 50-50.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
Huh, equal partners.
---
I bring a lot of experience.
---
## PRINCIPAL:
You can't do this without me
and you know that.
---
This way,
---
neither one of us will have
more to lose than the other.
---
[bell rings]
---
[background noise]
---
## WYNN:
What do you mean
you didn't watch the Super Bowl?
---
## KRAMER:
Did you watch
the Tony Awards?
---
## WYNN:
Who's Tony?
---
## LENORE:
Damn.
If it isn't the dynamic duo.
---
## KRAMER:
I hope you're not calling me
Robin.
---
## WYNN:
Wait.
He later became Nightmare.
---
## KRAMER:
He started out as a sidekick.
---
## WYNN:
Who ultimately became
a star in his own right,
---
and he will always be the young one.
---
## KRAMER:
True.
## WYNN:
Hear from Selma?
---
## LENORE:
I was just about to ask you
the same question, prince charming.
---
## WYNN:
Just because I was the last
one who saw her?
---
What about you?
## LENORE:
Why me?
---
Because she's a girl and I'm a girl?
## WYNN:
Yes. Makes sense.
---
## KRAMER:
I left a message with her stepdad.
---
## LENORE:
See?
Not all men are insensitive.
---
## WYNN:
You trying to make me look bad?
---
## KRAMER:
I didn't mean to.
---
## LENORE:
This might be weird timing,
---
but I just booked my first commercial.
---
## WYNN:
What?
## KRAMER:
You did not.
---
## LENORE:
I did.
I have a commercial agent.
---
## WYNN:
Congratulations.
---
## KRAMER:
How is it that you have
an agent before I have an agent?
---
## LENORE:
Luck, I guess?
---
## KRAMER:
I guess.
---
## WYNN:
That is not luck.
That is hard work.
---
Congratulate her.
## KRAMER:
It's not fair.
---
## WYNN:
Come on. Don't be a sore lo-
## KRAMER:
Are you about to say sore loser?
---
## WYNN:
No.
## KRAMER:
Because I'm not a loser.
---
I'm never going to lose.
## WYNN:
All right.
---
I know you're not a loser.
Calm down.
---
## KRAMER:
It's not a nice thing to say.
---
## WYNN:
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings,
Kramer.
---
## LENORE:
Is there something going on here?
## WYNN:
No.
---
## LENORE:
See? You just finished
each other's sentences.
---
## KRAMER:
Those were two separate sentences.
---
## WYNN:
Close together,
but not the same sentence.
---
## KRAMER:
Will you stop making
such a big deal over something
---
that is not at all a big deal?
---
## LENORE:
Oh, the lady
is protesting too much.
---
## KRAMER:
That's not even the quote.
---
## KRAMER:
I told you she was annoying.
---
## LENORE:
You told him I was annoying?
---
When?
## KRAMER:
At the gym.
---
## LENORE:
Oh,
---
so Batman and Robin are going to the gym
together now.
---
Gym buddies.
---
I think the other one was cuter.
---
These are going to look great
on the senior slideshow.
---
## WYNN:
Look at what you did.
---
## KRAMER:
I didn't do anything,
she's being a bitch.
---
## LENORE:
I changed my mind.
---
This is not going
in the senior slide show.
---
They're going on Instagram.
---
## WYNN:
What?
## KRAMER:
Like she has friends.
---
## LENORE:
I may not have a lot
of friends but I have followers.
---
## LENORE:
This picture's going to spread
---
like wildfire.
---
Wynn is one of the most popular guys
at this school.
---
## KRAMER:
What does that prove?
---
We're friends, big deal.
---
Besides,
it's not like you caught us kissing.
---
## WYNN:
Shut up, Kramer.
## LENORE:
Have you guys kissed?
---
## KRAMER:
Once.
## WYNN:
What the fuck?
---
## LENORE:
You kissed Wynn
and he didn't beat you up?
---
## KRAMER:
No, he kissed me.
---
## WYNN:
Jesus.
## KRAMER:
It wasn't a big deal.
---
## LENORE:
You don't even look gay.
## WYNN:
What is happening right now?
---
Kissing a guy doesn't make me gay.
---
## LENORE:
Okay,
it makes you sexually fluent.
---
That doesn't prove anything.
---
## WYNN:
I don't like guys.
---
## LENORE:
If kissing Kramer
doesn't make you gay,
---
kissing me doesn't make you straight.
---
No matter how many times you try.
---
Get close and partner up.
---
## WYNN:
Stop, I'm not a faggot.
---
## LENORE:
Give me my phone back,
and you can't say that word.
---
## WYNN:
Why?
It makes it clear who's who.
---
Nada, opposites.
---
## KRAMER:
Why would you say that to me?
---
You're my friend.
## WYNN:
I didn't say it to you,
---
all right.
---
I've done nothing wrong.
---
I let you work out with me
because you are weak and I'm strong.
---
I was doing you a favor
because that's what guys do,
---
you protect the weak.
---
## KRAMER:
Is that what you think of me?
---
## WYNN:
What else am I supposed to think?
---
Look at you.
---
## KRAMER:
Call me weak again.
## WYNN:
Kramer, stop.
---
## KRAMER:
You know you want to say it.
---
Say it.
---
Say it.
---
## LENORE:
Kramer. Kramer.
---
What the hell?
## KRAMER:
This isn't my fault.
---
## LENORE:
He only called you weak.
---
He didn't say it directly to you.
## KRAMER:
But he said it to you.
---
That's what he meant
when he was calling me weak.
---
## LENORE:
Look at what you did to him.
---
## KRAMER:
He deserves it.
---
Faggot.
---
## WYNN:
Stop, I can take care of myself.
---
## LENORE:
Let me walk you
to the school nurse.
---
[music]
---
## PRINCIPAL:
We have a zero-tolerance policy
for school violence.
---
## KRAMER:
I was provoked.
---
## KRAMER'S DAD:
Kramer would never do
anything unless he felt threatened.
---
## PRINCIPAL:
I can't allow Kramer
to come back to school.
---
The other boy said that Kramer-
## KRAMER:
His name is Wynn.
---
## PRINCIPAL:
Wynn, said you wouldn't stop
---
and because you're so strong-
## KRAMER:
No, I work out to protect myself.
---
Just like he does.
---
## PRINCIPAL:
Wynn has never been
in trouble before.
---
He's a star athlete
and he has a good record.
---
## KRAMER:
So do I.
---
He used a homophobic slur.
---
## PRINCIPAL:
Has Kramer shared any other problems
he's having here at school?
---
## KRAMER'S DAD:
No.
---
## PRINCIPAL:
Has he ever been evaluated
for anger issues?
---
## KRAMER'S DAD:
My son is not crazy.
---
He was disrespected and fought back.
---
## PRINCIPAL:
From what I've learned
in speaking to both the students
---
and a witness,
---
he didn't direct the alleged slur
to Kramer directly.
---
## KRAMER:
Alleged?
---
## PRINCIPAL:
If Kramer felt disrespected
or unsafe at any point
---
and had reported it-
---
## KRAMER'S DAD:

What about the other student?
---
What's his punishment?
---
## PRINCIPAL:
Wynn is in the hospital.
---
## KRAMER'S DAD:
Of course.
---
I don't mean to be unsympathetic.
---
Maybe it would be a good idea
for the parents
---
to get together to work
this out in a civil manner.
---
## PRINCIPAL:
Their lawyer
has told the mother not to.
---
## KRAMER'S DAD:
Their lawyer?
---
They have a lawyer?
---
Do we need a lawyer?
---
Is this a situation
where we need legal counsel?
---
Oh, Jesus.
---
## PRINCIPAL:
Did Wynn advance
towards you in a way that was threatening,
---
or in a way that you interpreted
as threatening?
---
## KRAMER:
The word he used.
---
## PRINCIPAL:
Yes, in your proximity,
I see how that can be triggering,
---
but he didn't physically try to hurt you?
---
## KRAMER:
No, I didn't give him the chance.
---
## KRAMER'S DAD:
What he's saying
is that he was scared, don't you get that?
---
## PRINCIPAL:
When you say
you didn't give him the chance -
---
## KRAMER:
I attacked him before
he had the chance to attack me.
---
I couldn't waste time hesitating,
questioning whether
---
or not what he said was a threat or not,
---
or weighing how much
of a threat that word is.
---
I reacted.
---
We're taught not to wait.
---
## PRINCIPAL:
By whom?
## KRAMER:
That's what our training is about,
---
isn't it?
---
Don't freeze up in the moment?
## KRAMER'S DAD:
What's he talking about?
---
## KRAMER:
You say
that you don't condone violence,
---
but are you also saying
that I would have just had to wait
---
until Wynn and a group
of his football player friends cornered me
---
in the hall or an empty classroom
like a sitting duck?
---
## PRINCIPAL:
So, you're not sorry?
---
## KRAMER:
I don't feel safe.
---
## PRINCIPAL:
Wait a moment.
We're not done yet.
---
## KRAMER'S DAD:
Oh, we're done.
---
Wait for me outside.
---
I'm handling this.
---
My son is brave.
---
Why shouldn't he fight back?
---
Our culture tells boys
to defend themselves all of the time.
---
Why not my son?
---
## PRINCIPAL:
Because you can't fight
violence with violence.
---
## KRAMER'S DAD:
Not according
to your training.
---
You will be hearing from my lawyer,
---
and not just because my son has been
discriminated against for his sexuality.
---
I don't know what kind of training
you're running at this school,
---
but my son wasn't violent
before he learned how to be.
---
[music]

## SELMA'S MOM:
Sorry that took so long.
## SELMA:
That's okay.
---
## SELMA'S STEPDAD:
You need another Coke?
---
Another?
---
Thanks, sweetheart.
---
## SELMA'S MOM:
Sorry that took so long.
---
## SELMA'S STEPDAD:
Ran into a buddy
of mine from work at the bar,
---
he bought us a drink.
---
## SELMA:
They know I was waiting for you?
---
## SELMA'S STEPDAD:
We didn't want
to embarrass you because of what happened,
---
the boy is in a class below you,
I think, or is it a girl?
---
## SELMA'S MOM:
 Have you had a chance
to look at the menu, Selma?
---
I can order anything you want
because it's a celebration.
---
You're going back to school tomorrow.
---
## SELMA'S STEPDAD:
Finally.
---
## SELMA'S MOM:
 We're so happy about it.
Aren't we?
---
How are you feeling about it, darling?
---
## SELMA:
I don't know.
---
## SELMA'S STEPDAD:
I'm going to pick you up
from school tomorrow myself.
---
## SELMA:
I thought Mom was coming to get me.
---
## SELMA'S MOM:
 I've got a last meeting
scheduled at the office.
---
You'll be fine.
---
## SELMA:
It's a real big deal
and I need you.
---
## SELMA'S MOM:
 Glenn can handle it.
---
## SELMA'S STEPDAD:
We'll be fine.
---
You need to stop babying her.
---
## SELMA'S MOM:
She's going
through something right now.
---
## SELMA'S STEPDAD:

Maybe she wouldn't be going through
---
something if you weren't always
babying her,
---
but you did rough up
that security guy pretty good.
---
[laughs].
---
We'll do something fun tomorrow
after school.
---
## SELMA'S MOM:
 People are starting to stare.
---
You need to keep your voice down
about what happened to her at school,
---
I don't want her to be stigmatized.
---
## SELMA'S STEPDAD:
Fine.
---
I'll talk to the friends at the bar,
they like it when I'm loud.
---
## SELMA:
Are you okay?
---
## SELMA'S MOM:
 Huh?
---
I'm fine.
---
I think we should order the prime rib.
---
We deserve it.
---
We're strong women.
Aren't we?
---
[music]
---
## WYNN'S MOM:
Surprise, happy birthday.
---
## WYNN:
My birthday was three weeks ago.
---
## WYNN'S MOM:
I had to wait
until you get out of the hospital.
---
## WYNN:
I got out of the hospital
two weeks ago,
---
and the nurses already got me a cake.
---
## WYNN'S MOM:
Oh,
that wasn't a real celebration.
---
It wasn't even your favorite cake.
---
You couldn't open your mouth.
---
I was going to plan it for as soon
as you get out of the hospital,
---
but I had to make up some hours
at work for all the time I took off.
---
I'm not saying anything is your fault.
## WYNN:
Wait, why are you home now?
---
## WYNN'S MOM:
Because some things
are more important than work.
---
Geoffrey is letting me coming in late.
## WYNN:
Without pay?
---
## WYNN'S MOM:
There's an ice cream cake
in the freezer.
---
Your brother is sorry, he can't be here.
He had a late band practice.
---
## WYNN:
So he thought you were crazy too?
[chuckles]
---
[silence]
---
## WYNN'S MOM:
It's just me and you.
---
Just like the old times
when you were an only child.
---
[laughter]
---
## WYNN:
Best six years of my life.
---
## WYNN'S MOM:
I thought
we could light the candles.
---
You can make a wish,
---
and then I can go back to work
and work half a shift.
---
But really,
---
it's just an excuse to have
some ice cream and cake.
---
[laughter]
---
## WYNN:
You know, you don't have
to keep trying to make me feel better.
---
I'm doing fine.
---
## WYNN'S MOM:
I know,
but I cherish these moments.
---
I won't be able to mother you forever.
---
Once you go off to college--
## WYNN:
Mom you have to stop worrying
---
about me, okay?
This is good practice.
---
## WYNN'S MOM:
That's what I thought,
but then this happened.
---
I don't know if I'll be able to stop
worrying about you now.
---
Plus,
---
I bought you all your favorite candy.
---
## WYNN:
What?
You didn't have to do that.
---
[laughter]
---
Oh, Junior Mints, Starbursts,
Mike and Ikes.
---
Okay, maybe being spoiled isn't so bad.
[chuckles]
---
## WYNN'S MOM:
I just keep thinking,
if I didn't have to work so much,
---
maybe this wouldn't have happened.
---
## WYNN:
I got beat up mom.
---
There's nothing you could do about that.
---
## WYNN'S MOM:
I think
that boy said he was your friend.
---
## WYNN:
He was.
---
## WYNN'S MOM:
I'm not so sure
we should have dropped the charges.
---
That could have paid for--
## WYNN:
It's not worth it.
---
## WYNN'S MOM:
You try working two jobs
and then ask again if it's worth it.
---
This is for your future,
your brother's future.
---
That school and that boy
could have ruined everything.
---
What if it would have swayed the scouts
that have been keeping their eye on you?
---
You have a real chance at something.
---
A scholarship could change your life.
---
## WYNN:
I don't have to go to college.
---
I could do other things to be successful.
---
## WYNN'S MOM:
You need education.
## WYNN:
You did fine without college.
---
## WYNN'S MOM:
I did fine, but not great.
---
I want you to be great.
---
## WYNN:
I will do great.
---
I'm joining the Army.
---
## WYNN'S MOM:
[laughs]
---
You are not going to the Army.
---
## WYNN:
What's wrong with the Army?
Great men have been in the Army.
---
## WYNN'S MOM:
Greater men
have gone to college.
---
The world is dangerous.
You don't got to be out there in it.
---
## WYNN:
That's why the world
needs protectors.
---
## WYNN'S MOM:
Just not you.
---
You're not serious, are you?
## WYNN:
Well, okay, I think I misspoke.
---
When I said I was joining the Army,
---
I meant to say that I joined the Army.
---
I enlisted.
[chuckles].
---
It's a good thing, the Army,
---
and don't worry,
I'll come back in one piece.
---
## WYNN'S MOM:
You can't promise that.
---
How did you even find out about this?
---
## WYNN:
It's the Army.
---
I was at the mall
and there were some recruiters there.
---
## WYNN'S MOM:
What about college?
What about those recruiters?
---
## WYNN:
If I finally want to go,
after I come back, I can still go.
---
[silence]
---
## WYNN'S MOM:
If you come back.
---
## WYNN:
Mom, I'll come back, okay?
---
Then college is covered
if I go to a state school.
---
Plus, there are great medical benefits,
---
not just for me,
but for our entire family.
---
Now you can stop working so hard.
---
Look, I am going to take care of us.
## WYNN'S MOM:
That's my job.
---
This is not how your life is going to go.
---
## WYNN:
Mom, I'm going to be fine, okay?
---
The Army's going to take care of me.
I'll have excellent male role models,
---
and I'll make you proud.
---
That is all you ever wanted for me.
---
Now you can stop worrying about me mom.
---
The Army is going to turn me
into an excellent man.
---
Mint chocolate chip with Oreos?
---
My favorite.
---
[music]
---
[silence]
---
## KRAMER'S MOM:

We are not suing the school.
---
## KRAMER'S DAD:
He's our son.
---
## KRAMER'S MOM:
He beat someone up so badly,
the boy was sent to the hospital.
---
[door closes]
## KRAMER'S DAD:
If Kramer had never
---
participated in these active
shooter drills,
---
he never would have learned
how to fight back and we wouldn't be here.
---
He's not a violent kid.
## KRAMER'S MOM:
He wasn't violent.
---
## KRAMER'S DAD:
So you agree with me?
---
## KRAMER'S MOM:

Haven't we been through enough?
---
Suing the school only means
this won't be over for a very long time.
---
## KRAMER'S DAD:
You've given up on him.
## KRAMER'S MOM:
I have not,
---
but I can't support what he did.
---
Imagine if this was Kramer,
---
in the hospital because someone
beat him up because he was gay?
---
## KRAMER'S DAD:

He's just going through something.
---
## KRAMER'S MOM:
Well then, we need
to have him psychologically evaluated.
---
Kramer needs help beyond
our capabilities.
---
If you really care--
## KRAMER'S DAD:
I can't listen to this.
---
## KRAMER:
Where are you going?
---
## KRAMER'S MOM:

Where do you think you're going?
---
## KRAMER'S DAD:
I think maybe,
---
it's a good idea if I sleep
somewhere else tonight.
---
## KRAMER:
Why?
---
## KRAMER'S DAD:
Kramer, it's fine.
## KRAMER'S MOM:
It's not fine.
---
We need to stop covering things up.
---
What you did Kramer,
---
is almost unforgivable.
---
## KRAMER:
I was taught to do anything
to fight when someone attacks.
---
## KRAMER'S MOM:
Not by us.
---
Wynn, didn't attack you.
---
## KRAMER:
That's what they rely on,
---
the guise of familiarity,
---
and then they attack.
---
With words, with weapons,
---
with whatever they can use to hurt you.
---
## KRAMER'S MOM:
Are you listening to this?
---
You can't just go around
beating up on people
---
because they say
something horrible to you.
---
What kind of person
does that make you?
---
## KRAMER:
Then let me fix it.
---
I'll go to anger management classes.
---
I'll volunteer with the homeless.
---
I'll clean my room, whatever it takes.
---
## KRAMER'S DAD:
It's too late, Kramer.
---
## KRAMER:
I'm going to fix this.
---
[bell ringing]
---
[background noise]
---
## LENORE:
You look nice.
---
You stopped coming to the training.
---
## SELMA:
It's voluntary.
---
## LENORE:
Not any more.
They're making it mandatory.
---
## SELMA:
I didn't know that.
---
## LENORE:
It's because you've been out
of school.
---
Where have you been?
---
I was worried about you.
---
No really, no one had heard from you.
---
## SELMA:
I didn't hear from anyone either.
---
## LENORE:
Kramer said he left
a message with your--
---
Anyway, I don't know
if you've heard yet,
---
but I've started a Gay-Straight Alliance.
---
Can you believe that the school
has never had one before?
---
I mean, it's the 21st century.
---
## SELMA:
It's good for you.
---
## LENORE:

Maybe if we had a Gay-Straight Alliance,
---
Kramer wouldn't have put Wynn
in the hospital.
---
## SELMA:
What?
---
## LENORE:
Oh, I forgot.
You've been out.
---
It's all anyone at the school
can talk about.
---
## SELMA:
That doesn't make sense.
They're friends.
---
## LENORE:
Were.
---
## SELMA:
I've only been gone a few days.
---
## LENORE:
It was a lot more than a few days.
---
You were gone.
---
Then Kramer and Wynn we're gone,
and I was just by myself.
---
Everyone was talking about your breakdown
and then about Kramer
---
just going off on Wynn and I thought,
"Wow, I'm the last one standing."
---
## SELMA:
It didn't feel that long.
---
## LENORE:
Funny how life changes,
---
because I was there you know.
---
I saw Kramer.
---
Like something in him had snapped.
---
Poor Wynn, he didn't fight back.
---
He's big enough to fight back.
---
## LENORE:
You would think
that he would fight back.
---
## SELMA:
Kramer is his friend.
---
## LENORE:
What?
## SELMA:
Nothing.
---
## LENORE:
Okay.
---
So, anyway, I thought,
“I have to do something.”
---
How could I not?
---
A Gay/Straight Alliance felt
like the right thing to do
---
to bring people together.
---
I have a gift.
---
I'm a unifier.
---
I started doing commercials, you know.
---
## SELMA:
I didn't.
---
## LENORE:
I can get up in front
of people and talk about building a bridge
---
of understanding because I was there.
---
## SELMA:
You said.
---
## LENORE:
Starting a socially relevant club
will get me into Yale for sure.
---
They have a whole school of Drama there.
---
That happens all the time now.
---
He pretends he doesn't know me either.
---
## SELMA:
Why?
---
## LENORE:
I don't know.
---
Maybe because
of everything that's happened.
---
You've missed a lot.
## SELMA:
You said, a lot.
---
## LENORE:
What are you doing here?
---
## KRAMER:
I was in the neighborhood.
---
I need to talk to--
## LENORE:
Just go.
---
It's better that way.
---
## KRAMER:
I'll just be here a minute.
---
## LENORE:
I don't think
he wants to talk to you.
---
Do you blame him?
---
## KRAMER:
It's been a while.
---
## SELMA:
Do you?
---
## KRAMER:
We should talk.
## WYNN:
I'm not interested.
---
## KRAMER:
Fine.
Where's Pete?
---
## LENORE:
He's not here.
## KRAMER:
Bullshit.
---
## SELMA:
Class is about to start.
---
You should go, Kramer.
## KRAMER:
As soon as I talk to Pete.
---
He's the whole reason I'm here.
If it weren't for him, I wouldn't have--
---
## WYNN:
Bullshit.
---
## KRAMER:
I thought you weren't talking
to me.
---
Why do you keep looking at the teacher?
---
## LENORE:
She's ready to start class.
---
## KRAMER:
I said I'm not going anywhere
until I talk to Pete.
---
## WYNN:
Listen, Kramer.
---
This isn't going to end well.
## KRAMER:
Why?
---
You're going to do something?
## WYNN:
Maybe you should just go home.
---
Talking to Pete
isn't going to help anything.
---
## LENORE:
Maybe you could walk Kramer out.
---
Make sure he gets in his car okay.
---
## KRAMER:
A military escort.
---
How flattering.
---
I heard about the Army.
---
## WYNN:
Looks like
we don't have to catch up after all then.
---
## KRAMER:
You don't need
to escort me off the grounds.
---
## WYNN:
I'm just coming with you outside.
## KRAMER:
Why?
---
You want to kiss me?
---
## LENORE:
Just go and leave us alone.
---
You've done enough.
---
## KRAMER:
You're all scared of me.
## SELMA:
Not me.
---
## KRAMER:
When did I become the bad guy?
---
I've been looking for you.
---
## SELMA:
Don't try anything.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:

Where'd you get that?
---
Selma, give me the gun.
## SELMA:
It's my stepdad's.
---
It's supposed to keep us safe.
---
He has it to show us who's in charge.
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:

At home.
---
You're too young to--
## SELMA:
But if he has a gun,
---
then shouldn't I?
## KRAMER:
I don't have a gun!
---
I swear.
I just came here to talk.
---
I swear.
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:

I believe you.
---
## SELMA:
Why?
---
He's supposed to say that.
---
You can't believe him.
He's the active shooter.
---
## LENORE:
That's Kramer.
---
## SELMA:
They all have a name.
---
Until you forget it
because all you can remember
---
is what they've done.
He's dangerous.
---
## WYNN:
Hand me the gun, Selma.
---
You're not in the best condition
to handle that right now.
---
Selma.
---
## SELMA:
You didn't think I would do that
---
because I'm a girl
and girls aren't shooters.
---
They couldn't possibly know
what they're doing.
---
## LENORE:
Are you okay?
## WYNN:
I'll be fine.
---
## SELMA:
It's what you said.
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:

It's not what I said.
---
## LENORE:
What should we do?
## WYNN:
I hope that gun doesn't go off.
---
## LENORE:
What are the chances?
## KRAMER:
Remember,
---
he got us into this mess
in the first place.
---
Would you even know how powerful guns
are if it weren't for him?
---
## WYNN:
Maybe she doesn't know
how to use it, in a way that helps us.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
What are you doing?
---
## LENORE:
What are our chances of survival?
---
## WYNN:
That depends on the gun going off.
---
## KRAMER:
Would I have known
how to defend myself,
---
would Wynn be joining to the Army?
## WYNN:
Don't blame him.
---
## SAFETY CONSULTANT:
I wanted to keep you safe.
---
## LENORE:
Famous last words.
## SELMA:
Shut up.
---
## WYNN:
Okay, just put the gun down.
## SELMA:
Everyone just shut up.
---
I can't think
---
[crosstalk]
---
[gun shot]

[sirens]

[phones ringing]
