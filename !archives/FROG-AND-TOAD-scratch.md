THREE BIRDS
WE FLEW SOUTH FOR THE WINTER SOUTH FOR THE WINTER
EV'RY FALL WE PACK OUR THINGS AND GO WE KNOW JUST HOW TO TIME IT
TO FIND THE PROPER CLIMATE
ONE THAT DOESN'T FEATURE ANY SNOW 'CAUSE WHEN IT SNOWS YOU SHIVER AND IT'S DIFFICULT TO FLY
THERE ISN'T ANY FOOD
WHICH IS ANOTHER REASON WHY WE GO SOUTH FOR THE WINTER SOUTH FOR THE WINTER
BUT WE'RE BACK IT'S ALMOST SPRING IN SPRING THE WEATHER'S LOVELY
IT ELEVATES THE MOOD
BUT EVEN MORE IMPORTANT THERE'S A PLENTITUDE OF FOOD SO IF YOU'RE FEELING PECKISH YOU CAN GO FOR SECONDS EVEN THIRDS

MANBIRD 
WINTER'S FOR THE BIRDS

LADYBIRD 1 
No it isn't.

MANBIRD
It's an expression.

LADYBIRD 1 
 Oh.

THREE BIRDS 
WINTER NOW IS OVER
THE SNOW HAS ALL BEEN SNOWED SPRING IS NEAR
WHICH STARTS A YEAR WITH FROG AND TOAD

MAN BIRD
Well, it's true folks. Spring is almost here. The sun will be shining. The flowers will be growing and the birds will be chirping.
LADYBIRDS
Chirp chirpitty chirp.
MAN BIRD
Over here we have Frog. And over here we have Toad. They are both at the end of a winter long hibernation. Let's take a peek in and see what they're dreaming about.

HE IS THE FINEST FRIEND
OF ALL THE CRITTERS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
 TOAD

CHATTING OVER COZY CUPS OF TEA HE KNOWS JUST THE THING TO SAY THAT WILL BRIGHTEN UP MY DAY

TOAD

FROG
Yes, and soon it became dark. 

TOAD 
Did this really happen Frog?

FROG
Maybe yes and·maybe no. Should I stop telling you the story?

YOUNG FROG
Oh well. It was very nice to have met you, I'll be going now.
LARGE AND TERRIBLE FROG
Not so fast. You must do something for me.
YOUNG FROG
Oh, I'd be only too happy to. What is it?
LARGE AND TERRIBLE FROG
After dinner, I like to have a little exercise so I can work up an appetite for a late snack.

YOUNG FROG
Exercise?
LARGE AND TERRIBLE FROG
Yes skipping rope. And you shall tum for me. Take hold of that end.
YOUNG FROG

FROG
I'm just curious. Did you happen to get any mail today?
TOAD
No I did not Frog! I never get any mail and it makes me unhappy. You know that. Sc why do you insist on bringing it up all the time?
FROG
I'm sorry Toad.
TOAD
That's all right.

FROG
I’m sorry Toad 

TOAD
That’s alright 
FROG
I wonder what time it is? 

TOAD
Well, I don't know that either Frog. As I have repeatedly explained to you, my clock is broken. I need to get a new clock
FROG
Of course. That slipped my mind. Well, here we are at the top of the hill. Look at that view 

TOAD
The snow is lovely. But it’s an awfully long way down. 

FROG 
It will be easy on my sled.
TOAD 
Oh I don't know Frog. I don't think you should go. It looks scary.

FROG 
Don't be silly Toad. It's not as if I'll be riding all alone.
TOAD
Oh, someone is going with you?

FROG
Yes of course 
TOAD 
Oh, well that makes all the difference 
FROG 
Yes it does. 
TOAD 
Who’s going with you? 
FROG
You are. 
TOAD 
Oh no Frog. 
FROG 
Don’t be nervous Toad. I’ll be behind you the whole time. It’s pleasant sledding down the hill.
TOAD
It’s more pleasant sitting in a warm house eating soup. 
FROG 
We can do that once we reach the bottom. Come on. Take a risk. 
TOAD
Oh, very well Frog. Ill go through with it. 
FROG 
That’s fine. You’ll see. It’s pleasant sledding down the hill.
Here we go.

TOAD 
And angry 

FROG
Why? 

TOAD 
Frog, you left me alone. 

FROG
I couldn’t help it Toad. 

TOAD 
Oh, yes you could have. You could have not suggested that we go sledding in the first place and exposing us to such a terrible risk 

FROG
Now Toad. 

TOAD 
Oh don’t now Toad me, Frog. I was in absolute peril. 

FROG
Well I am sorry Toad. 

Where are you going? 


TOAD 
I’m going home to a warm bowl of soup. And I will never speak with you again. 

FROG
But Toad…

SNAIL
Hello Toad. I have a letter for you. 

TOAD
You have?

SNAIL
Yes. 

TOAD
Thank you Snail. 
SNAIL
You’re welcome. Well I gotta run. 

TOAD
"Dear Toad. Today when you told me that you were sad because you had never received a letter, it made me sad too. I suppose that is how it is with you and me. I am writing this letter, hoping that it will make you feel happy, knowing all along that unless you are happy I cannot be. Your friend Frog. 

Frog? 

FROG
Yes Toad?
TOAD
I am speaking to you again.

FROG
I'm glad Toad.
TOAD
At home, I have some soup.

FROG
That's nice.

TOAD
 If you want, I will warm some up for you.
FROG
Why, yes Toad. That would be very pleasant.
SNAIL

TOAD
It's Christmas Eve. The fire is burning. The hot chocolate is ready. But Frog is late. At
least I think he is late. But, he must be late. It has been dark for a very long time. Maybe something has happened to him. Maybe something bad. Maybe something terrible. Maybe he is lost in the dark and he cannot find his way and he is cold and shivering.
Or maybe, he is stuck at the bottom of a hole and he cannot get out and he is cold and shivering. Or maybe, he is being chased by a wolf and he's running as fast as he can and well, he wouldn't be cold and shivering, because when you run it warms you up, but that is not the point. The point is that Frog may be in terrible danger. I must do something. I must help my friend. I must get a lamp and a rope

 Frog! Frog! Don't worry, I'll save you! I am prepared for any situation.

TOAD
IF YOU ARE... LOST IN THE DARK
YOU ARE LOST IN THE DARK
AND YOUR FINGERS
ARE STARTING TO FREEZE I HAVE A LIGHT
THAT WILL CUT THROUGH THE NIGHT SO YOU WON'T BUMP YOUR
HEAD ON THE TREES OR IF YOU ARE...
DEEP IN A HOLE
YOU ARE STUCK IN A HOLE AND NO ONE CAN HEAR
AS YOU SHOUT I'LL BRING A ROPE
A THICK PIECE OF ROPE AND USE IT
TO HELP PULL YOU OOOUUUUUT I AM NOT AFRAID
WELL I AM BUT I'LL BE BRAVE
FROG FROG FROG FROG FROG YOU ARE THE ONE
I'M GOING TO SAVE
IF THERE'S A…
WOLF AT YOUR HEELS
GIANT WOLF AT YOUR HEELS
AND YOU'RE RUNNING AS FAST AS YOU CAN I'LL STOP THE WOLF
I'LL IN FACT BOP THE WOLF
ON THE HEAD WITH A BIG FRYING PAAAAAAN
I AM NOT AFRAID WELL I AM BUT I'LL BE BRAVE
FROG FROG FROG FROG FROG



FROG
Hello Toad.

TOAD
YOU ARE THE ONE

Frog! You're here! You're not lost in the dark.
FROG
No. 
TOAD
You're not being chased by a wolf?

FROG
No. 

TOAD
Well where have you been? 
FROG
I’m sorry to be late Toad. I was wrapping your gift. 

TOAD
Oh. For me? 

FROG
Yes. 
TOAD
I can open it? 
FROG
Of course 
TOAD
It’s a clock! 
FROG
Yes and it keeps very good time. 

TOAD
I needed a clock. 
FROG
I know you did Toad. 
TOAD
Your present isn’t here yet. 

FROG
That’s all right Toad. 

TOAD
It was supposed to be delivered this afternoon. 
FROG
It’s being delivered? 

TOAD
Yes. 

FROG
By whom? 

TOAD
Snail. He should be here any minute. 

FROG
Maybe we should sit down.

TOAD
I'll put the clock on the mantle. This is lovely wrapping paper Frog.
FROG
Thank you Toad. This is a very nice fire.

TOAD
It's warm.

FROG
This is a very peaceful Christmas eve.

TOAD
It didn't start out that way.

FROG
I'm sorry I was late.

SOUTH FOR THE WINTER
JUST LIKE AT THE OP'NING OF THE SHOW 
TRA LA LA LA LA
TRA LA LA LA LA LA
AND THEN OF COURSE THE PROBLEM WITH THE SNOW
BUT...
THE WINTER NOW IS OVER
THE SNOW HAS ALL BEEN SNOWED 
SPRING IS HERE
WHICH STARTS A YEAR WITH FROG AND TOAD

MANBIRD
Well, here we are again folks. You know, through the years some things change and that's good. And some things don't change and that's good too.

LADYBIRDS
Chirp, chirpitty-chirp.

MANBIRD
One thing that will never change: Frog and Toad will always be good friends.
FROG
I'D LIKE TO SING A LITTLE ODE 
ABOUT MY GOOD FRIEND TOAD
TOAD WITH WHOM I FREQUENTLY TAKE TEA 
HE'S NOT SO GOOD AT SPORTS
AND OF COURSE HE'S GOT THOSE WARTS
BUT TOAD HAS BEEN A LOVELY FRIEND TO ME 
TOAD, I FEEL, IS VASTLY UNDERRATED
AND FURTHERMORE, I THINK, MISUNDERSTOOD
AND IN CONCLUSION I WILL ADD
HE IS THE FINEST FRIEND 
OF ALL THE CRITTERS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD

TOAD
I LOVE A LIVELY DIALOGUE 
WITH MY GOOD FRIEND FROG
CHATTING OVER COZY CUPS OF TEA 
HE KNOWS JUST THE THING TO SAY 
THAT WILL BRIGHTEN UP MY DAY
OH FROG HAS BEEN A LOVELY FRIEND TO ME 
FROG IS VERY KINDLY IN HIS NATURE 
MAGNANIMOUS WHENEVER PLAYING HOST 
OF ALL THE CREATURES IN MY SPHERE
OF INFLUENCE
I'M FONDEST OF THE FROG THE MOST

Hello Frog


FROG
Hello Toad. Are you hibernating? 
TOAD
Why yes I am. And you? 

FROG
Oh yes, most definitely. And I have had many, many dreams. 

TOAD
Well, funny so have I.
FROG
Have they been pleasant dreams?
TOAD
Some have been pleasant and some have been not so pleasant. But you have been i every one of them.
FROG
Funny, you have been in all of my dreams too.
TOAD
I had one not so pleasant dream, where we went swimming.
FROG
Really? So did I. And I had a dream that you made the most wonderful cookies.
TOAD
Really? So did I. And I dreamed that we went down a hill on a sled.
FROG
Really? So did I.
TOAD
This is uncanny.

FROG
Remarkable. Well, I'm getting ready to wake up, so you better get back to your own
dream. I'll see you when you wake up.
TOAD
Yes, I'd better get back to hibernating. Spring is nearly here.
FROG
Oh, I think it's just around the corner. Birds?
THREE BIRDS
THE SUN IS OUT
THE SKY IS CLEAR 
WE CAME BACK
SPRING MUST BE HERE
SO LET'S BEGIN ANOTHER YEAR
ALL
A YEAR WITH FROG AND TOAD
A YEAR WITH FROG AND TOAD

THE END.
