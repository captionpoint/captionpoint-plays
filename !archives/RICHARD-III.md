## A SOLDIER:
Sound the alarm!

---

[Sounds of a raging battle]

---

[Shouting and battle cries]

---

[Swords clanging]

---


---


## GLOUCESTER:
I do but dream on sovereignty;



Like one that stands upon a promontory,

---

And spies a far-off shore where he would tread,


And chides the sea that sunders him from thence,

---

So do I wish the crown, being so far off;


And so I chide the means that keeps me from it;

---

Well, say there is no kingdom then for Richard;



What other pleasure can the world afford?

---

I'll make my heaven in a lady's lap,



And deck my body in gay ornaments,

---

And witch sweet ladies with my words and looks.



O monstrous fault, to harbour such a thought!

---

Then, since this earth affords no joy to me,



I'll make my heaven to dream upon the crown,

---

And yet I know not how to get the crown,

For many lives stand between me and home:

---

Why, I can smile, and murder whiles I smile,



I can add colours to the chameleon,

---

And set the murderous Machiavel to school.



Can I do this, and cannot get a crown?

---

Tut, were it farther off, I'll pluck it down.

---

---

## BUCKINGHAM

---

## GLOUCESTER:
Now is the winter of our discontent

Made glorious summer by this son of York;

---

And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house


In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.

---

Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;



Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;

---

Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,



Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.

---

Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;



And now, instead of mounting barbed steeds

---

To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,



He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber

---

To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.



But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,

---

Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;



I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty

---

To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;



I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,

---

Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,



Deformed, unfinish'd, sent before my time

---

Into this breathing world, scarce half made up,



And that so lamely and unfashionable

---

That dogs bark at me as I halt by them;



Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,

---

Have no delight to pass away the time,



Unless to spy my shadow in the sun

---

And descant on mine own deformity:



And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover,

---

To entertain these fair well-spoken days,



I am determined to prove a villain

---

And hate the idle pleasures of these days.



Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,

---

By drunken prophecies, libels and dreams,



To set my brother Clarence and the king

---

In deadly hate the one against the other:



And if King Edward be as true and just

---

As I am subtle, false and treacherous,



This day should Clarence closely be mew'd up,

---

About a prophecy, which says that 'G'



Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be.

---

Dive, thoughts, down to my soul: here



Clarence comes.

---

[Sigh offstage]

---

Brother, good day; what means this armed guard

That waits upon your grace?

---

## CLARENCE:
His majesty, tendering my person's safety, hath appointed this conduct to convey me to the Tower.

---

## GLOUCESTER:
Upon what cause?

---

## CLARENCE:
Because my name is George.

---

## GLOUCESTER:
Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours;



He should, for that, commit your forefathers:

---

O, belike his majesty hath some intent



That you shall be imprison'd in the Tower.

---

But what's the matter, Clarence? may I know?

---

## CLARENCE:
He hearkens after prophecies and dreams;

---

And says a wizard told him that by G



His issue disinherited should be.

---

## GLOUCESTER:
Why, this it is, when men are ruled by women:


'Tis not the king that sends you to the Tower:

---

My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, 'tis she


That tempers him to this extremity.

---

We are not safe, Clarence; we are not safe.

---

## CLARENCE:
By heaven, I think there's no man is secure

---

Heard ye not what an humble suppliant



Lord Hastings was to her for his delivery?

---

## BRAKENBURY:
I beseech your graces both to pardon me;


His majesty hath straitly given in charge

---

That no man shall have private conference,



Of what degree soever, with his brother.

---

## GLOUCESTER:
Even so; an't please your worship, Brakenbury,



You may partake of any thing we say:

---

We speak no treason, man: we say the king


Is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen

---

Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous;



How say you sir? Can you deny all this?

---

## BRAKENBURY:
With this, my lord, myself have nought to do.

---

I beseech your grace to pardon me, and withal



Forbear your conference with the noble duke.

---

## CLARENCE:
We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will obey.

---

## GLOUCESTER:
We are the queen's abjects, and must obey.

---

Brother, farewell: I will unto the king;

---

Meantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood



Touches me deeper than you can imagine.

---

## CLARENCE:
I know it pleaseth neither of us well.

---

## GLOUCESTER:
Well, your imprisonment shall not be long;



Meantime, have patience.

---

## CLARENCE:
I must perforce. 

---

---



Farewell.

---

## GLOUCESTER:
Go, tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return.

---

Simple, plain Clarence! I do love thee so,



That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven,

---

But who comes here? the new-deliver'd Hastings?

---

## HASTINGS:
Good time of day unto my gracious lord!

---

## GLOUCESTER:
As much unto my good lord chamberlain!

---

Well are you welcome to the open air.

---

How hath your lordship brook'd imprisonment?

---

## HASTINGS:
With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must:

---

But I shall live, my lord, to give them thanks



That were the cause of my imprisonment.

---

## GLOUCESTER:
No doubt, no doubt; and so shall Clarence too;

---

For they that were your enemies are his,



And have prevail'd as much on him as you.

---

What news abroad?

---

## HASTINGS:
No news so bad abroad as this at home;

---

The King is sickly, weak and melancholy,



And his physicians fear him mightily.

---

## GLOUCESTER:
Now, by Saint Paul, this news is bad indeed.

---

O, he hath kept an evil diet long,



And overmuch consumed his royal person:

---

'Tis very grievous to be thought upon.



What, is he in his bed?

---

## HASTINGS:
He is.

---

## GLOUCESTER:
Go you before, and I will follow you.

---

---

He cannot live, I hope; and must not die

Till George be pack'd with post-horse up to heaven.

---

And, if I fall not in my deep intent,



Clarence hath not another day to live:

---

Which done, God take King Edward to his mercy,



And leave the world for me to bustle in!

---

For then I'll marry Henry’s youngest daughter.



What though I kill'd her husband and her father?

---

The readiest way to make the wench amends



Is to become her husband and her father:

---

But yet I run before my horse to market:

---

Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns:



When they are gone, then must I count my gains.

---

---

[Drumming]

---

---

## LADY ANNE:
Set down, set down your honourable load,

---

Poor key-cold figure of a holy king!

---

Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster!

---

Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood!

---

Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost,

---

To hear the lamentations of Poor Anne,

---

Wife to thy Edward, to thy slaughter'd son,

---

Stabb'd by the selfsame hand that made these wounds!

---

Cursed be the hand that made these fatal holes!

---

Cursed the heart that had the heart to do it;

---

Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence

---

If ever he have wife, let her be made

---

As miserable by the death of him

---

As I am made by my poor lord and thee!

---

Come, now towards Chertsey with your holy load,

---

Taken from Paul's to be interred there;

---

(Offstage)
## GLOUCESTER:
Stay, you that bear the corse, and set it down.

---

## LADY ANNE:
What dark magician conjures up this fiend?

---

## GLOUCESTER:
Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,



I'll make a corse of him that disobeys.

---

## GUARD:
My lord, stand back, and let the coffin pass.

---

## GLOUCESTER:
Unmanner'd dog! stand thou, when I command:

---

## LADY ANNE:
What, do you tremble? are you all afraid?

---

Alas, I blame you not; for you are mortal,



And mortal eyes cannot endure the devil.

---

Avaunt, thou dreadful minister of hell!

---

## GLOUCESTER:
Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst.

---

## LADY ANNE:
Foul devil, for God's sake, hence, and trouble us not;



For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell,

---

Behold this pattern of thy butcheries.

---

O, gentlemen, see, see! dead Henry's wounds


Open their congeal'd mouths and bleed afresh!

---

O God, which this blood madest, revenge his death!

---

O earth, which this blood drink'st revenge his death!

---

Either heaven with lightning strike the murderer dead,

---

Or earth, gape open wide and eat him quick,

---

As thou dost swallow up this good king's blood



Which his hell-govern'd arm hath butchered!

---

## GLOUCESTER:
Lady, you know no rules of charity,



Which renders good for bad, blessings for curses.

---

## LADY ANNE:
Villain, thou know'st no law of God nor man:



No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity.

---

## GLOUCESTER:
But I know none, and therefore am no beast.

---

## LADY ANNE:
O wonderful, when devils tell the truth!

---

## GLOUCESTER:
More wonderful, when angels are so angry.

---

Vouchsafe, divine perfection of a woman,

---

Of these supposed-evils, to give me leave,



By circumstance, but to acquit myself.

---

## LADY ANNE:
Vouchsafe, defused infection of a man,

---

For these known evils, but to give me leave,



By circumstance, to curse thy cursed self.

---

## GLOUCESTER:
I did not kill your husband.

---

## LADY ANNE:
Didst thou not kill this king?

---

## GLOUCESTER:
I grant ye.

---

## LADY ANNE:
Dost grant me, hedgehog? then, God grant me too



Thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed!

---

O, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous!

---

## GLOUCESTER:
The fitter for the King of heaven, that hath him.

---

## LADY ANNE:
He is in heaven, where thou shalt never come.

---

## GLOUCESTER:
Let him thank me, that holp to send him thither;



For he was fitter for that place than earth.

---

## LADY ANNE:
And thou unfit for any place but hell.

---

## GLOUCESTER:
Yes, one place else, if you will hear me name it.

---

## LADY ANNE:
Some dungeon.

---

## GLOUCESTER:
Your bed-chamber.

---

## LADY ANNE:
Ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest!

---

## GLOUCESTER:
So will it, madam till I lie with you.



But, gentle Lady Anne,

---

Is not the causer of these timeless deaths



As blameful as the executioner?

---

## LADY ANNE:
Thou art the cause, and most accursed effect.

---

## GLOUCESTER:
Your beauty was the cause of that effect;



Your beauty: which did haunt me in my sleep

---

To undertake the death of all the world,



So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom.

---

[Slap]

---

## LADY ANNE:
If I thought that, I tell thee, homicide,



These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks.

---

## GLOUCESTER:
These eyes could never endure sweet beauty's wreck;


You should not blemish it, if I stood by:

---

As all the world is cheered by the sun,



So I by that; it is my day, my life.

---

## LADY ANNE:
Black night o'ershade thy day, and death thy life!

---

It is a quarrel just and reasonable,



To be revenged on him that slew my husband.

---

## GLOUCESTER:
He that bereft thee, lady, of thy husband,



Did it to help thee to a better husband.

---

## LADY ANNE:
His better doth not breathe upon the earth.

---

## GLOUCESTER:
He lives that loves thee better than he could.

---

## LADY ANNE:
Where is he?

---

## GLOUCESTER:
Here.

---

[Lady Anne spits]

---

Why dost thou spit at me?

---

## LADY ANNE:
Would it were mortal poison, for thy sake!

---

## GLOUCESTER:
Never came poison from so sweet a place.

---

## LADY ANNE:
Never hung poison on a fouler toad.

---

Out of my sight! thou dost infect my eyes.

---

## GLOUCESTER:
Thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine.



For now they kill me with a living death.

---

Teach not thy lips such scorn, for they were made



For kissing, lady, not for such contempt.

---

If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive,

---

Lo, 

---

here I lend thee this sharp-pointed blade;

---

Which if thou please to hide in this true bosom.



And let the soul forth that adoreth thee,

---

I lay it naked to the deadly stroke,



And humbly beg the death upon my knee.

---

Nay, do not pause; for I did kill King Henry,



But 'twas thy beauty that provoked me.

---

Nay, now dispatch; 'twas I that stabb'd young Edward,



But 'twas thy heavenly face that set me on.

---

Take up the blade again, or take up me.

---

## LADY ANNE:
Arise, dissembler: though I wish thy death,



I will not be the executioner.

---

## GLOUCESTER:
Then bid me kill myself, and I will do it.

---

## LADY ANNE:
I have already.

---

## GLOUCESTER:
Tush, that was in thy rage:

---

Speak it again, and, even with the word,



That hand, which, for thy love, did kill thy love,

---

Shall, for thy love, kill a far truer love;



To both their deaths thou shalt be accessary.

---

## LADY ANNE:
I would I knew thy heart.

## GLOUCESTER:
'Tis figured in my tongue.

---

## LADY ANNE:
I fear me both are false.



## GLOUCESTER:
Then never man was true.

---

## LADY ANNE:
Well, well, put up your blade.



## GLOUCESTER:
But shall I live in hope?

---

## LADY ANNE:
All men, I hope, live so.

---

---


## GLOUCESTER:
Vouchsafe to wear this ring.

---

## LADY ANNE:
To take is not to give.

---

## GLOUCESTER:
Look, how this ring encompasseth finger.


Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart;

---

Wear both of them, for both of them are thine.

---

And if thy poor devoted suppliant may



But beg one favour at thy gracious hand,

---

Thou dost confirm his happiness for ever.

---

## LADY ANNE:
What is it?

---

## GLOUCESTER:
That it would please thee leave these sad designs



To him that hath more cause to be a mourner,

---

Then, after I have solemnly interr'd



At Chertsey monastery this noble king,

---

And wet his grave with my repentant tears,



I will with all expedient duty see you:

---

Grant me this boon.

---

## LADY ANNE:
With all my heart; and much it joys me too,



To see you are become so penitent.

---

## GLOUCESTER:
Bid me farewell.

---

## LADY ANNE:
'Tis more than you deserve;

---

But since you teach me how to flatter you,



Imagine I have said farewell already.

---

Ha!

Have patience, madam: there's no doubt his majesty

In that you brook it in, it makes him worse:

Therefore, God's sake, entertain good comfort,



And cheer his grace with quick and merry words.

---

## QUEEN ELIZABETH:
If he were dead, what would become of me?

## RIVERS:
No other harm but loss of such a lord.

---

## GREY:
The heavens have bless'd you with a goodly son,



To be your comforter when he is gone.

---

## QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Oh, he is young and his minority



Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester,

---

A man that loves not me, nor none of you.

---

## RIVERS:
Is it concluded that he shall be protector?

---

## QUEEN ELIZABETH:
It is determined, not concluded yet:



But so it must be, if the king miscarry.

---

## GREY:
Here come the lords of Buckingham and Stanley.

---

## BUCKINGHAM:
Good time of day unto your royal grace!

---

## STANLEY:
God make your majesty joyful as you have been!

---

## RIVERS:
Saw you the king to-day, Lord Stanley?

---

## STANLEY:
But now the Duke of Buckingham and I



Are come from visiting his majesty.

---

## BUCKINGHAM:
Madam, good hope; his grace speaks cheerfully.

---

## QUEEN ELIZABETH:
God grant him health! Did you confer with him?

---

## BUCKINGHAM:
Madam, we did: he desires to make atonement



Betwixt the Duke of Gloucester and your brothers,

---

And betwixt them and my lord chamberlain.

---

## QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Would all were well! but that will never be



I fear our happiness is at the highest.

---

## GLOUCESTER:
They do me wrong, and I will not endure it:

---

Who are they that complain unto the king,



That I, forsooth, am stern, and love them not?

---

Because I cannot flatter and speak fair,



I must be held a rancorous enemy.

---

Cannot a plain man live and think no harm,



But thus his simple truth must be abused

---

By silken, sly, insinuating Jacks?

---

## RIVERS:
To whom in all this presence speaks your grace?

## GLOUCESTER:
To thee, that hast nor honesty nor grace.



When have I injured thee? when done thee wrong?

---

Or thee? or thee? or any of your faction?



A plague upon you all! 

---

## QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Come, come, we know your meaning, brother Gloucester;

---

You envy my advancement and my friends':



God grant we never may have need of you!

---

## GLOUCESTER:
Meantime, God grants that we have need of you:

---

My brother is imprison'd by your means.

---

## QUEEN ELIZABETH:
I never did incense his majesty



Against the Duke of Clarence, but have been



An earnest advocate to plead for him.

---

My lord, you do me shameful injury,



Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects.

---

## GLOUCESTER:
You may deny that you were not the cause



Of my Lord Hastings' late imprisonment.

---

## RIVERS:
She may, my lord, for—

---

## GLOUCESTER:
She may, Lord Rivers! why, who knows not so?



She may do more, sir, than denying that:

---

What may she not? She may, yea, marry, may she—

---

## RIVERS:
What, marry, may she?

---

## GLOUCESTER:
What, marry, may she! marry with a king,

---

A bachelor, a handsome stripling too:



I wish your grandam had a worser match.

---

## QUEEN ELIZABETH:
My Lord of Gloucester, I have too long borne



Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs:

---

By heaven, I will acquaint his majesty



With those gross taunts I often have endured.

---

Small joy have I in being England's queen.

---

## QUEEN MARGARET:
And lessen'd be that small, God, I beseech thee!



Thy honour, state and seat is due to me.

---

## GLOUCESTER:
What! threat you me with telling of the king?



Tell him, and spare not: look, what I have said

---

I will avouch in presence of the king:



I dare adventure to be sent to the Tower.

---

## QUEEN MARGARET:
Out, devil! I remember them too well:

---

Thou slewest my dearest husband Henry,



And Edward, my poor son, at Tewksbury.

---

## GLOUCESTER:
Ere you were queen, yea, or your husband king,



I was a pack-horse in his great affairs;

---

To royalize his blood I spilt mine own.

---

In all which time you and your husband Grey



Were factious for the house of Lancaster;

---

Let me put in your minds, if you forget,



What you have been ere now, and what you are;

---

Withal, what I have been, and what I am.

---

## QUEEN MARGARET:
A murderous villain, and so still thou art.

---

## RIVERS:
My Lord of Gloucester, in those busy days



We follow'd then our lord, our lawful king:

---

So should we you, if you should be our king.

---

## GLOUCESTER:
If I should be! I had rather be a pedlar:



Far be it from my heart, the thought of it!

---

## QUEEN ELIZABETH:
As little joy, my lord, as you suppose



You should enjoy, were you this country's king,

---

As little joy may you suppose in me.



That I enjoy, being the queen thereof.

---

## QUEEN MARGARET:
A little joy enjoys the queen thereof;



For I am she, and altogether joyless.

---

Hear me, you wrangling pirates, that fall out



In sharing that which you have pill'd from me!

---

Which of you trembles not that looks on me?



O gentle villain, do not turn away!

---

## GLOUCESTER: 
Foul wrinkled witch, what makest thou in my sight?

Wert thou not banished on pain of death?

---

## QUEEN MARGARET:
I was; but I do find more pain in banishment



Than death can yield me here by my abode.

---

A husband and a son thou owest to me;

---

And thou a kingdom; all of you allegiance:

---

The sorrow that I have, by right is yours,

---

And all the pleasures you usurp are mine.

---

For your young son, which now is Prince of Wales,

---

For Edward my son, which was Prince of Wales,

---

Die in his youth by like untimely violence!

---

Thyself a queen, for me that was a queen,



Outlive thy glory, like my wretched self!

---

Long mayst thou live to wail thy children's loss;



And see another, as I see thee now,

---

Deck'd in thy rights, as thou art stall'd in mine!

---

Long die thy happy days before thy death;

---

And, after many lengthen'd hours of grief,



Die neither mother, wife, nor England's queen!

---

Rivers and Dorset, you were standers by,



And so wast thou, Lord Hastings, when my son

---

Was stabb'd with bloody daggers: God, I pray him,



That none of you may live your natural age,

---

## GLOUCESTER:
Have done thy charm, thou hateful wither'd hag!

---

## QUEEN MARGARET:
And leave out thee? stay, dog, for thou shalt hear me.

---

If heaven have any grievous plague in store


Exceeding those that I can wish upon thee,

---

O, let them keep it till thy sins be ripe,

---

And then hurl down their indignation



On thee, the troubler of the poor world's peace!

---

No sleep close up that deadly eye of thine,

---

Unless it be whilst some tormenting dream



Affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils!

---

Thou elvish-mark'd, abortive, rooting hog!

---

Thou slander of thy mother's heavy womb!

---

Thou loathed issue of thy father's loins!

---

Thou rag of honour! thou detested—

---

## GLOUCESTER:
Margaret.


--

## QUEEN MARGARET:
Richard!

---

## GLOUCESTER:
Ha!

--

## QUEEN MARGARET:
I call thee not.

---

## GLOUCESTER:
I cry thee mercy then, for I had thought



That thou hadst call'd me all these bitter names.

---

## QUEEN MARGARET:
Why, so I did; but look'd for no reply.



O, let me make the period to my curse!

---

## GLOUCESTER:
'Tis done by me, and ends in 'Margaret.'

---

## QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Thus have you breathed your curse against yourself.

---

## QUEEN MARGARET:
Poor painted queen, vain flourish of my fortune!

---

Why strew'st thou sugar on that bottled spider,



Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about?

---

Fool, fool! thou whet'st a knife to kill thyself.

The time will come when thou shalt wish for me

---

To help thee curse that poisonous bunchback'd toad.

---


## RIVERS:
Were you well served, you would be taught your duty.

---

## HASTINGS:
Dispute not with her; she is lunatic.

---

## GLOUCESTER:
Good counsel, marry: learn it, learn it, Rivers.

---

## BUCKINGHAM:
Enough! for shame, if not for charity.

---

## QUEEN MARGARET:
Urge neither charity nor shame to me:

---

Uncharitably with me have you dealt,



And shamefully by you my hopes are butcher'd.

---

[Crowd commotion]

---

## BUCKINGHAM:
Enough, enough.

---

## QUEEN MARGARET:
O princely Buckingham I'll kiss thy hand,

---

Thy garments are not spotted with our blood,



Nor thou within the compass of my curse.

---

## BUCKINGHAM:
Nor no one here; for curses never pass



The lips of those that breathe them in the air.

---

## QUEEN MARGARET:
O Buckingham, take heed of yonder dog!



Look, when he fawns, he bites; and when he bites,

---

His venom tooth will rankle to the death:



Have not to do with him, beware of him;

---

## GLOUCESTER:
What doth she say, my Lord of Buckingham?

---

## BUCKINGHAM:
Nothing that I respect, my gracious lord.

---

## QUEEN MARGARET:
What, dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel?



And soothe the devil that I warn thee from?

---

O, but remember this another day,



When he shall split thy very heart with sorrow,

---

And say poor Margaret was a prophetess!

---

Live each of you the subjects to his hate,



And he to yours, and all of you to God's!

---

---

## HASTINGS:
My hair doth stand on end to hear her curses.

---

## RIVERS:
And so doth mine: I muse why she's still free to speak.

---

## GLOUCESTER:
I cannot blame her: by God's holy mother,

---

She hath had too much wrong; and I repent



My part thereof that I have done to her.

---

## QUEEN ELIZABETH:
I never did her any, to my knowledge.

---

## GLOUCESTER:
But you have all the advantages of her wrong.



God pardon them that are the cause of it!

---

## RIVERS:
A virtuous and a Christian-like conclusion,



To pray for them that have done scathe to us.

---

## GLOUCESTER:
So do I ever:

---

## CATESBY:
Madam, his majesty doth call for you,



And for your grace; and you, my noble lords.

---

## QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Catesby, we come. Lords, will you go with us?

---

## RIVERS:
Madam, we will attend your grace.

---

---

## GLOUCESTER:
How now, my hardy, stout resolved mates!



Are you now going to dispatch the deed?

---

## LOVELL:
We are, my lord; and come to have the warrant



That we may be admitted where he is.

---

## GLOUCESTER:
But, sirs, be sudden in the execution,



Withal obdurate, do not hear him plead;

---

## LOVELL:
We will, my noble lord.

---

---

[Drumming]

---

---

## BRAKENBURY:
Why looks your grace so heavily today?

---



## CLARENCE:
O, I have pass'd a miserable night,



So full of ugly sights, of ghastly dreams,

---

That, as I am a Christian faithful man,



I would not spend another such a night,

---

Though 'twere to buy a world of happy days,



So full of dismal terror was the time!

---

## BRAKENBURY:
What was your dream? I long to hear you tell it.

---

[An organ drone]

---

## CLARENCE:
Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower,



And was embark'd to cross to Burgundy;

---

And, in my company, my brother Gloucester;

---



Who from my cabin tempted me to walk

Upon the hatches:  

---

As we paced along
Methought that Gloucester stumbled; and, in falling,

---

Struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard,



Into the tumbling billows of the main.

---

Lord, Lord! methought, what pain it was to drown!

---

What ugly sights of death within mine eyes!

---

Methought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks;



Ten thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon;

---

Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,



Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,

---

All scatter'd in the bottom of the sea:

---

Some lay in dead men's skulls; and, in those holes



Where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept,

---

As 'twere in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems,



Which woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep,

---

And mock'd the dead bones that lay scatter'd by.

---

## BRAKENBURY:
Had you such leisure in the time of death



To gaze upon the secrets of the deep?

---

## CLARENCE:
Methought I had; and often did I strive



To yield the ghost: but still the envious flood

---

Kept in my soul, and would not let it forth



To seek the empty, vast and wandering air;

---

But smother’d it within my painting bulk,



Which almost burst to belch it in the sea.

---

## BRAKENBURY:
Awaked you not with this sore agony?

---

## CLARENCE:
O, no, my dream was lengthen'd after life;

---

O, then began the tempest to my soul,



Who pass'd, methought, the melancholy flood,

---

With that grim ferryman which poets write of,



Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.

---

With that, methoughts, a legion of foul fiends



Environ'd me about, and howled in mine ears

---

Such hideous cries, that with the very noise



I trembling waked, and for a season after

---

Could not believe but that I was in hell,



Such terrible impression made the dream.

---

## BRAKENBURY:
No marvel, my lord, though it affrighted you;



I promise, I am afraid to hear you tell it.

---

## CLARENCE:
O Brakenbury, I have done those things,



Which now bear evidence against my soul,



For Edward's sake; and see how he prisons me!

---

I pray thee, gentle keeper, stay by me;



My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep.

---

## BRAKENBURY:
I will, my lord: God give your grace good rest!

---

---

## RATCLIFFE:
Ho! who's here?

---

## BRAKENBURY:
In God's name what are you, and how came you hither?

---

## RATCLIFFE:
I would speak with Clarence, and I came hither on my legs.

---

## BRAKENBURY:
Yea, are you so brief?

---

## LOVELL:
O sir, it is better to be brief than tedious. Show



him our commission; talk no more.

---

## BRAKENBURY:
I am, in this, commanded to deliver



The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands:

---

Here are the keys, there sits the duke asleep:



Thus I have resign'd my charge to you.

---

## RATCLIFFE:
Fare you well.

---

## LOVELL:
What, shall we stab him as he sleeps?



No; then he will say ‘twas done cowardly, when he wakes

---

## RATCLIFFE:
When he wakes! why, fool, he shall never wake till



the judgement-day

---

## LOVELL:
Why, then he will say we stabbed him sleeping.

---

The urging of that word 'judgment' hath bred a kind



of remorse in me.

---

## RATCLIFFE:
What, art thou afraid?

---

## LOVELL:
Not to kill him, having a warrant for it; but to be



damned for killing him, from which no warrant can defend us.

---

## RATCLIFFE:
I thought thou hadst been resolute.

---

## LOVELL:
So I am, to let him live.

---

## RATCLIFFE:
Back to the Duke of Gloucester, tell him so.

---

## LOVELL:
I pray thee, stay a while: I hope my holy humour



will change.

---

## RATCLIFFE:
How dost thou feel thyself now?

---

## LOVELL:
'Faith, some certain dregs of conscience are yet



within me.

---

## RATCLIFFE:
Remember our reward, when the deed is done.

---

## LOVELL:
'Zounds, he dies: I had forgot the reward.

---

## RATCLIFFE:
Where is thy conscience now?

---

## LOVELL:
In the Duke of Gloucester's purse.

---

## RATCLIFFE:
So when he opens his purse to give us our reward,



thy conscience flies out.

---

## LOVELL:
Let it go; there's few or none will entertain it.

---

## RATCLIFFE:
How if it come to thee again?

---

## LOVELL:
I'll not meddle with it: it is a dangerous thing: 



it makes a man a coward: 

 

---

'tis a blushing shamefast spirit that mutinies in a man's bosom; it fills one full of obstacles:

---


it made me once restore a purse of gold that I found; 

---

it beggars any man that keeps it: 

---

it is turned out of all towns and cities for a dangerous thing; 

---

and every man that means to live



well endeavours to trust to himself and to live without it.

---

## RATCLIFFE:
Tut, I am strong-framed, it cannot prevail with me,



I warrant thee.

---

## CLARENCE:
Where art thou, keeper? give me a cup of wine.

---

## RATCLIFFE:
You shall have drink enough, my lord, anon.

---

## CLARENCE:
In God's name, what art thou?

---

Your eyes do menace me: why look you pale?



Who sent you hither? Wherefore do you come?

---

## BOTH:
To, to, to—

---

## CLARENCE:
To murder me?

---

## BOTH:
Ay, ay.

---

## CLARENCE:
Are you call'd forth from out a world of men



To slay the innocent? What is my offence?

---

Where are the evidence that do accuse me?

---

What lawful quest have given their verdict up



Unto the frowning judge? or who pronounced

---

The bitter sentence of poor Clarence' death?



The deed you undertake is damnable.

---

## RATCLIFFE:
What we will do, we do upon command.

---

## CLARENCE:
If you are hired for coin, go back again,



And I will send you to my brother Gloucester

---

Who shall reward you better for my life



Than Edward will for tidings of my death

---

## LOVELL:
You are deceived, your brother Richard hates you.

---

## CLARENCE:
O, do not slander him, for he is kind.

---

## RATCLIFFE:
Thou deceivest thyself:



'Tis he that sent us hither now to slaughter thee.

---

## CLARENCE:
It cannot be; for when I parted with him,

---

He hugg'd me in his arms, and swore, with sobs,



That he would seek my release.

---

## RATCLIFFE:
Make peace with God, for you must die, my lord.

---


---

## CLARENCE:
Relent, and save your souls.

---

## RATCLIFFE:
Relent! 'tis cowardly.

---

Take that, and that: if all this will not do,

---

I'll drown you within.

---

[Shouting and grunting]

---

[Panting and gasping]

---



---

[Silence]

---

[Drum beats]

---

---

## KING EDWARD IV:
Why, so: now have I done a good day's work:

---

You peers, continue this united league:

---

Rivers and Hastings, take each other's hand;

---

Dissemble not your hatred, swear your love.

---

## RIVERS:
By heaven, my heart is purged from grudging hate:

And with my hand I seal my true heart's love.

---

## KING EDWARD IV:
Madam, yourself are not exempt in this,

---

Nor your son Dorset, Buckingham, nor you;

---

You have been factious one against the other,

---

Wife, love Lord Hastings, let him kiss your hand;

---

And what you do, do it unfeignedly.

---

---


## QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Here, Hastings; 

---

---


## QUEEN ELIZABETH:
I will never more remember

Our former hatred, so thrive I and mine!

---

## KING EDWARD IV:
Dorset, embrace him; Hastings, love lord marquess.

---

---



## DORSET:
This interchange of love, I here protest,



Upon my part shall be unviolable.

---

## HASTINGS:
And so swear I, my lord

---

## KING EDWARD IV:
Now, princely Buckingham, seal thou this league



With thy embracements to my wife's allies,

---

And make me happy in your unity.

---

## BUCKINGHAM:
Whenever Buckingham doth turn his hate



On you or yours, but with all duteous love

---

Doth cherish you and yours, God punish me



With hate in those where I expect most love!

---

## KING EDWARD IV:
A pleasing cordial, princely Buckingham,



is this thy vow unto my sickly heart.

---

There wanteth now my brother Gloucester here,



To make the perfect period of this peace.

---

## BUCKINGHAM:
And, in good time, here comes the noble duke.

---

## GLOUCESTER:
Good morrow to my sovereign king and queen:



And, princely peers, a happy time of day!

---

## KING EDWARD IV:
Happy, indeed, as we have spent the day.

Brother, we done deeds of charity;

---

Made peace enmity, fair love of hate,



Between these swelling wrong-incensed peers.

---

## GLOUCESTER:
A blessed labour, my most sovereign liege:



Amongst this princely heap, if any here,

---

By false intelligence, or wrong surmise,



Hold me a foe; I desire to reconcile me to his friendly peace:

---

First, madam, I entreat true peace of you,



Dukes, earls, lords, gentlemen; indeed, of all.

---

I thank my God for my humility.

---

## QUEEN ELIZABETH: 
My sovereign liege, I do beseech your majesty

To take our brother Clarence to your grace.

---

## GLOUCESTER:
Why, madam, have I offer'd love for this



To be so mocked in this royal presence?

---

Who knows not that the noble duke is dead?

---

[Gasps]

---

You do him injury to scorn his corse.

---

## RIVERS:
Who knows not he is dead! who knows he is?

---

## QUEEN ELIZABETH:
All seeing heaven, what a world is this!

---

## KING EDWARD IV:
Is Clarence dead? the order was reversed.

---

## GLOUCESTER:
But he, poor soul, by your first order died,

---

## STANLEY:
A boon, my sovereign, for my service done!

---

## KING EDWARD IV:
Stanley, I pray thee, peace: my soul is full of sorrow.

---

## STANLEY:
I will not rise, unless your highness grant.

---

## KING EDWARD IV:
Then speak at once what is it thou demand'st.

---

## STANLEY:
The forfeit, sovereign, of my servant's life;



Who slew to-day a righteous gentleman.

---

## KING EDWARD IV:
Have a tongue to doom my brother's death,



And shall the same give pardon to a slave?

---

My brother slew no man; his fault was thought,



And yet his punishment was cruel death.

---

Who sued to me for him? 

---

who, in my rage,



Kneel'd at my feet, and bade me be advised

---

Who spake of brotherhood? who spake of love?


Who told me, in the field by Tewksbury

---

When Oxford had me down, he rescued me,



And said, 'Dear brother, live, and be a king'?

---

But when your carters or your waiting-vassals



Have done a drunken slaughter, and defaced

---

The precious image of our dear Redeemer,



You straight are on your knees for pardon, pardon;

---

And I unjustly too, must grant it you



But for my brother not a man would speak,

---

[Coughs]

---

O God, I fear thy justice will take hold



On me, and you, and mine, and yours for this!

---

Come, Rivers, help me to my bedroom.

---

Oh, poor Clarence!

---

---

## GLOUCESTER:
This is the fruit of rashness! Mark'd you not



How that the guilty kindred of the queen

---

Look'd pale when they did hear of Clarence' death?

O, they did urge it still unto the king!

---

God will revenge it. But come, let us in,



To comfort Edward with our company.

---

## BUCKINGHAM:
We wait upon your grace.

---

---

[Mournful music and drums]

---

---

## QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Oh, who shall hinder me to wail and weep,



To chide my fortune, and torment myself?

---

## DUCHESS OF YORK:
What means this scene of rude impatience?

---

## QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Edward, my lord, your son, our king, is dead.

---

[Sobbing]

---

## DUCHESS OF YORK:
I have bewept a worthy husband's death,



And lived by looking on his images:

---

But now two mirrors of his princely semblance



Are crack'd in pieces by malignant death,

---

And I for comfort have but one false glass,



Which grieves me when I see my shame in him.

---

Thou art a widow; yet thou art a mother,



And hast the comfort of thy children left thee:

---

But death hath snatch'd my husband from mine arms,



And pluck'd two crutches from my feeble limbs,

---

Edward and Clarence. O, what cause have I,



Thine being but a moiety of my grief,

---

To overgo thy plaints and drown thy cries!

---

## QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Oh for my husband, for my dear lord Edward!

---

## DUCHESS OF YORK:
Alas for both, both mine, Edward and Clarence!

---

## DORSET:
Comfort, dear mother: God is much displeas’d



That you take with unthankfulness, his doing.

---

In common worldy things, ‘tis call’d ungrateful



With dull unwillingness to repay a debt

---

Which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent



Much more to be thus opposite with heaven

---

For it requires the royal debt it lent you.

---

## RIVERS:
Madam, bethink you, like a careful mother,



Of the young prince your son: send straight for him

---

Let him be crown'd; in him your comfort lives:

---

## GLOUCESTER:
Madam, have comfort: all of us have cause



To wail the dimming of our shining star;

---

But none can cure their harms by wailing them.



Madam, my mother, I do cry you mercy;

---

I did not see your grace: humbly on my knee



I crave your blessing.

---

## DUCHESS OF YORK:
God bless thee; and put meekness in thy mind,



Love, charity, obedience, and true duty!

---

## BUCKINGHAM:
You cloudy princes and heart-sorrowing peers,

---

That bear this mutual heavy load of moan,



Now cheer each other in each other's love

---

Though we have spent our harvest of this king,



We are to reap the harvest of his son.

---

The broken rancour of your high-swoln hearts,



Must gently be preserved, cherish'd, and kept:

---

Me seemeth good, that, with some little train,

---

Forthwith from Ludlow the young prince be fetch'd



Hither to London, to be crown'd our king.

---

## RIVERS:
Why with some little train, my Lord of Buckingham?

---

## BUCKINGHAM:
Marry, my lord, lest, by a multitude,



The new-heal'd wound of malice should break out,

---

## GLOUCESTER:
I hope the king made peace with all of us



And the compact is firm and true in me.

---

## RIVERS:
And so in me; and so, I think, in all:



Therefore I say with noble Buckingham,

---

That it is meet so few should fetch the prince.

---

## HASTINGS:
And so say I.

---

## GLOUCESTER:
Then be it so; and go we to determine



Who they shall be that straight shall post to Ludlow.


---

---

## BUCKINGHAM:
My lord, whoever journeys to the Prince,



For God's sake, let not us two be behind;

---

For, by the way, I'll sort occasion,



To part the queen's proud kindred from the prince.

---

## GLOUCESTER:
My oracle, my prophet! My dear cousin,

---

I, like a child, will go by thy direction.



Towards Ludlow then, for we'll not stay behind.

---

---

[Mournful music and drums]


---

---

## ARCHBISHOP:
Last night, I hear, they lay at Northampton;



To-morrow, or next day, they will be here.

---

## DUCHESS OF YORK:
I long with all my heart to see the prince:



I hope he is much grown since last I saw him.

---

## QUEEN ELIZABETH:
But I hear, no; they say my son of York



Hath almost overta'en him in his growth.

---

## YORK: 
Ay, mother; but I would not have it so.

---

## DUCHESS OF YORK:
Why, my young cousin, it is good to grow.

---

## YORK: 
Grandam, one night, as we did sit at supper,

---

My uncle Rivers talk'd how I did grow



More than my brother: 'Ay,' quoth my uncle



Gloucester,

---

'Small herbs have grace, great weeds do grow apace:'

---

And since, methinks, I would not grow so fast,



Because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste

---

## DUCHESS OF YORK:
Good faith, good faith, the saying did not hold



In him that did object the same to thee;

---

He was the wretched'st thing when he was young,



So long a-growing and so leisurely,

---

That, if this rule were true, he should be gracious.

---

## YORK: 
Marry, they say my uncle grew so fast



That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old

---

'Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth.

---

## ARCHBISHOP:
Here comes Dorset. What news?

---

## DORSET:
Such news, my lord, as grieves me to unfold.

---

## QUEEN ELIZABETH:
How fares the prince?

---

## DORSET:
Well, mother, and in health.

---

## DUCHESS OF YORK:
What is thy news then?

---

## DORSET:
Lord Rivers and Lord Grey are sent to Pomfret, prisoners.

---

## DUCHESS OF YORK:
Who hath committed them?

---

## DORSET:
The mighty dukes Gloucester and Buckingham.

---

## QUEEN ELIZABETH:
For what offence?

---

## DORSET:
Why or for what these nobles were committed



Is all unknown to me, my gracious lady.

---

## QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Ay me, I see the downfall of our house!

---

The tiger now hath seized the gentle hind;



I see, as in a map, the end of all.

---

## DUCHESS OF YORK:
Accursed and unquiet wrangling days,



How many of you have mine eyes beheld!

---

## QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Come, come, my boy; we will to sanctuary.

---

Madam, farewell.

---

## DUCHESS OF YORK:
I'll go along with you.

---

## ARCHBISHOP:
My gracious lady, go;



And thither bear your treasure and your goods.

---

Come, I'll conduct you to the sanctuary.

---

---

[Drumming]

---

---




## BUCKINGHAM:
Welcome, sweet prince, to London.

---

## GLOUCESTER:
Welcome, dear nephew, my thoughts' sovereign



The weary way hath made you melancholy.

---

## PRINCE EDWARD:
I want more uncles here to welcome me.

---

## GLOUCESTER:
Sweet prince, the untainted virtue of your years



Hath not yet dived into the world's deceit

---

Those uncles which you want were dangerous;

---

## PRINCE EDWARD:
God keep me from false friends! 

---

---

[Stately trumpet fanfare]

---

## GLOUCESTER:
My lord, the mayor of London comes to greet you.

---

## LORD MAYOR:
God bless your grace with health and happy days!

---

## PRINCE EDWARD:
I thank you, good my lord; and thank you all.

---

I thought my mother, and my brother York,



Would long ere this have met us on the way

---

## PRINCE EDWARD:
Welcome, my lord: what, will our mother come?

---

## HASTINGS:
On what occasion, God he knows, not I,

---

The queen your mother, and your brother York,



Have taken sanctuary: 

---

the tender prince would fain have come with me to meet your grace,

---

But by his mother was perforce withheld.

---

## BUCKINGHAM:
Fie, what an indirect and peevish course



Is this of hers! Lord Hastings, will your grace

---

Persuade the queen to send the Duke of York



Unto his princely brother presently?

---

If she deny, Lord Hastings,



From her jealous arms do pluck him perforce.

---

## HASTINGS:
I go, my lord.

---

## PRINCE EDWARD:
Say, uncle Gloucester, if our brother come,



Where shall we sojourn till our coronation?

---

## GLOUCESTER:
Where it seems best unto your royal self.

---

If I may counsel you, some day or two



Your highness shall repose you at the Tower:

---

## PRINCE EDWARD:
I do not like the Tower, of any place.

---

Did Julius Caesar build that place, my lord?

---

## BUCKINGHAM:
He did, my gracious lord, begin that place;

---

## PRINCE EDWARD:
That Julius Caesar was a famous man;

---

Death makes no conquest of this conqueror;



For now he lives in fame, though not in life.

---

I'll tell you what, my cousin Buckingham,--

---

## BUCKINGHAM:
What, my gracious lord?

---

## PRINCE EDWARD:
An if I live until I be a man,



I'll win our ancient right in France again,

---

Or die a soldier, as I lived a king.

---

## BUCKINGHAM:
Now, in good time, here comes the Duke of York.

---

---



## PRINCE EDWARD:
How fares our loving brother?

---

## YORK:
Well, my dread lord; so must I call you now.

---

## PRINCE EDWARD:
Ay, brother, to our grief, as it is yours:

---

Too late he died that might have kept that title,


Which by his death hath lost much majesty.

---

## GLOUCESTER:
How fares our cousin, noble Lord of York?

---

## YORK:
I pray you, uncle, give me this dagger.

---

## GLOUCESTER:
My dagger, little cousin? 

---

It is too heavy for your grace to wear.

---

## YORK:
I weigh it lightly, were it heavier.

---

## GLOUCESTER:
What, would you have my weapon, little lord?

---

## YORK:
I would, that I might thank you as you call me.

---

## GLOUCESTER:
How?

---

## YORK:
Little.

---

## GLOUCESTER:
My lord, will't please you pass along to the Tower?

---

## YORK:
I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower.

---

## GLOUCESTER:
Why, what should you fear?

---

## YORK:
Marry, my uncle Clarence' angry ghost:



My grandam told me he was murdered there.

---

## PRINCE EDWARD:
I fear no uncles dead.

---

## GLOUCESTER:
Nor none that live, I hope.

---

## PRINCE EDWARD:
An if they live, I hope I need not fear.





---

## BUCKINGHAM:
Well, let them rest. Come hither, Catesby.

---

---


Thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend



As closely to conceal what we impart:

---

Thou know'st our reasons urged upon the way;

---

What think'st thou? is it not an easy matter



To make Lord Hastings of our mind,

---

For the instalment of this noble duke



In the seat royal of this famous isle?

---

## CATESBY:
He for his father's sake so loves the prince,



That he will not be won to fight against him.

---

## BUCKINGHAM:
What think'st thou, then, of Stanley? what will he?

---

## CATESBY:
He will do all in all as Hastings doth.

---

## BUCKINGHAM:
Well, then, no more but this: go, gentle Catesby,

---

As it were far off seek thou Lord Hastings,



How doth he stand affected to our purpose;

---

And summon him to-morrow to the Tower,



To sit about the coronation.

---

If thou dost find him tractable to us,


Encourage him, and show him all our reasons:

---

If he be leaden, icy-cold, unwilling,



Be thou so too; and so break off your talk,

---

And give us notice of his inclination:

---

For we to-morrow hold divided councils,



Wherein thyself shalt highly be employ'd.

---

## GLOUCESTER:
Commend me to Lord Hastings,
tell him, Catesby,

---

His ancient knot of dangerous adversaries



To-morrow are let blood at Pomfret-castle.

---

## CATESBY:
My good lords both, with all the heed I may.

---

## BUCKINGHAM:
Now, my lord, what shall we do, if we perceive



Lord Hastings will not yield to our complots?

---

## GLOUCESTER:
Chop off his head, man; somewhat we will do:

---

And, look, when I am king, claim thou of me



The earldom of Hereford, and the moveables

---

Whereof the king my brother stood possess'd.

---

## BUCKINGHAM:
I'll claim that promise at your grace's hands.

---

## GLOUCESTER:
And look to have it yielded with all willingness.

---

[Drumming]

[HASTINGS singing a tune]

---

## HASTINGS:
♪ Imagine me and you, I do ♪

♪ I think about you day and night, it's only right ♪

---

♪ To think about the girl you love and hold her tight

♪ So happy together... ♪

---

## STANLEY:
What, ho! my lord!

---

## HASTINGS:
What is't o'clock?

---

## STANLEY:
Upon the stroke of four.

---

## HASTINGS:
Cannot you sleep these tedious nights?

---

## STANLEY:
So it should seem by that I have to say.

---

I dreamt to-night the duke had razed my helm:



Besides, there are two councils held;

---

And that may be determined at the one



which may make you and I rue at the other.

---

Therefore I needs must know your lordship's pleasure,



If presently you will take horse with me,

---

And with all speed post with me toward the north,



To shun the danger that my soul divines.

---

## HASTINGS:
Do not fear the separated councils

---

Your honour and myself are at the one,



And at the other is our good friend Catesby

---

And for your dreams, I wonder you are so fond



To trust the mockery of unquiet slumbers

---

Go,  we will both together to the Tower,



Where, you will see, the boar will use us kindly.

---

---


## CATESBY:
Many good morrows to my noble lord!

---

## HASTINGS:
Good morrow, Catesby; you are early stirring



What news, what news, in this our tottering state?

---

## CATESBY:
It is a reeling world, indeed, my lord;

---

And I believe twill never stand upright



Till Richard wear the garland of the realm.

---

## HASTINGS:
How! wear the garland! dost thou mean the crown?

---

## CATESBY:
Ay, my good lord.

---

## HASTINGS:
I'll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders



Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.

---

But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it?

---

## CATESBY:
Ay, on my life; and hopes to find forward



Upon his party for the gain thereof:

---

And thereupon he sends you this good news,



That this same very day your enemies,

---

The kindred of the queen, must die at Pomfret.

---

## HASTINGS:
Indeed, I am no mourner for that news,



Because they have been still mine enemies:

---

But, that I'll give my voice on Richard's side,



To bar my master's heirs in true descent,

---

God knows I will not do it, to the death.

---

## CATESBY:
God keep your lordship in that gracious mind!

---

## HASTINGS:
I tell thee, man, 'tis better with me now



Than when I met thee last where now we meet:

---

Then was I going prisoner to the Tower,



By the suggestion of the queen's allies;

---

This day those enemies are put to death,



And I in better state than e'er I was.

---

## CATESBY:
God hold it, to your honour's good content!

---

## HASTINGS:
Gramercy, fellow: there, drink that for me.

---

## CATESBY:
God save your lordship!

---

## HASTINGS:
♪ So happy together... ♪

[Drumming]

## RATCLIFF:
Come, bring forth the prisoners.

---

## RIVERS:
Sir Ratcliff, let me tell thee this:

---

To-day shalt thou behold a subject die



For truth, for duty, and for loyalty.

---

## GREY:
God keep the prince from all the pack of you!

---



A knot you are of damned blood-suckers!

---

## RATCLIFF:
Dispatch; the limit of your lives is out.

---

## RIVERS:
O Pomfret, Pomfret! O thou bloody prison,



Fatal and ominous to noble peers!

---

Within the guilty closure of thy walls



We give thee up our guiltless blood to drink.

---

[Slow, ominous drum beats]

---

## GREY:
Now Margaret's curse is fall'n upon our heads,



For standing by when Richard stabb'd her son.

---

## RIVERS:
Then cursed she Hastings, then cursed she Buckingham,

---

Then cursed she Richard. O, remember, God



To hear her prayers for them, as now for us

---

And for my sister and her princely sons,

---

Be satisfied, dear God, with our true blood,



Which, as thou know'st, unjustly must be spilt.

---

---

[Screams and crying]

---

[Slow drum beats continue]

---

---


## LOVELL:
Make haste; the hour of death is near.

---

---

## RIVERS:
Come, Grey, come, and let us embrace:

---

And take our leave, until we meet in heaven.

---

---

[Faster drum beats]

---


---

## HASTINGS:
My lords, at once: the cause why we are met



Is, to determine of the coronation.

---

In God's name, speak: when is the royal day?

---

## BUCKINGHAM:
Are all things fitting for that royal time?

---

## STANLEY:
It is, and wants but nomination.

---

## BISHOP OF ELY:
To-morrow, then, I judge a happy day.

---

## BUCKINGHAM:
Who knows the lord protector's mind herein?



Who is most inward with the royal duke?

---

## BISHOP OF ELY:
Your grace, we think, should soonest know his mind.

---

## BUCKINGHAM:
Who, I, my lord we know each other's faces,

---

But for our hearts, he knows no more of mine,



Than I of yours; Nor I no more of his, than you of mine.

---

Lord Hastings, you and he are near in love.

---

## HASTINGS:
I thank his grace, I know he loves me well;



But, for his purpose in the coronation.

---

I have not sounded him, nor he deliver'd



His gracious pleasure any way therein:

---

But you, my noble lords, may name the time;

---

And in the duke's behalf I'll give my voice,



Which, I presume, he'll take in gentle part.

---

## BISHOP OF ELY:
Now in good time, here comes the duke himself.

---

## GLOUCESTER:
My noble lords and cousins all, good morrow.



I have been long a sleeper; 

---

## BUCKINGHAM:
Had not you come upon your cue, my lord

---

Hastings had pronounced your part,--



I mean, your voice,--for crowning of the king.

---

## GLOUCESTER:
Than my Lord Hastings no man might be bolder;



His lordship knows me well, and loves me well.

---

## HASTINGS:
I thank your grace.

---

## GLOUCESTER:
Good Bishop of Ely!

---

## BISHOP OF ELY:
My lord?

---

## GLOUCESTER:
When I was last in Holborn,



I saw good strawberries in your garden there

---

I do beseech you send for some of them.

---

## BISHOP OF ELY:
Marry, and will, my lord, with all my heart.

---

## GLOUCESTER:
Cousin of Buckingham, a word with you.

---

Catesby hath sounded Hastings in our business,

---

And finds the testy gentleman so hot,


As he will lose his head ere give consent

---

His master's son, as worshipful as he terms it,



Shall lose the royalty of England's throne.

---

## BUCKINGHAM:
Withdraw you hence, my lord, I'll follow you.

---

## HASTINGS:
His grace looks cheerfully and smooth to-day;

---

I think there's never a man in Christendom



That can less hide his love or hate than he;

---

For by his face straight shall you know his heart.

---

## STANLEY:
What of his heart perceive you in his face



By any likelihood he show'd to-day?

---

## HASTINGS:
Marry, that with no man here he is offended;



For, were he, he had shown it in his looks.

---

## STANLEY:
I pray God he be not, I say.

---

## GLOUCESTER:
I pray you all, tell me what they deserve



That do conspire my death with devilish plots?

---

## HASTINGS:
The tender love I bear your grace, my lord,

---

Makes me most forward in this noble presence



To doom the offenders, whatsoever they be

---

## GLOUCESTER:
Then be your eyes the witness of this ill:

---

See how I am bewitch'd; behold mine eye



Is, like a blasted sapling, wither'd up:

---

And this is Edward's wife, that monstrous witch,



That by their witchcraft thus have marked me.

---

## HASTINGS:
If they have done this thing, my gracious lord—

---

## GLOUCESTER:
If I thou protector of this damned strumpet--



Tellest thou me of 'ifs'? Thou art a traitor:

---

Off with his head! Now, by Saint Paul I swear,



I will not dine until I see the same.

---

Catesby and Ratcliffe, look that it be done:



The rest, that love me, rise and follow me.

---

---


## HASTINGS:
Woe, woe for England! not a whit for me;



For I, too fond, might have prevented this.

---

Stanley did dream the duke did raze his helm;



But I disdain'd it, and did scorn to fly:

---

I now repent I told you dear Catesby



As 'twere triumphing at mine enemies,

---

How they at Pomfret bloodily were butcher'd,



And I myself secure in grace and favour.

---

O Margaret, Margaret, now thy heavy curse



Is lighted on poor Hastings' wretched head!

---

## CATESBY:
Dispatch, my lord; the duke would be at dinner:



Make a short shrift; he longs to see your head.

---

## HASTINGS:
O bloody Richard! miserable England!

---

Come, lead me to the block; bear him my head.



They smile at me that shortly shall be dead.

---

---


## BISHOP OF ELY:
Where is my lord protector? I have sent for these strawberries.

---

[Cymbal crash]

---

[Drumming]

---

---


## GLOUCESTER:
Come, cousin, canst thou quake, and change thy colour,



As if thou wert distraught and mad with terror?

---

## BUCKINGHAM:
Tut, I can counterfeit the deep tragedian;

---

## CATESBY:
Here is the head of that ignoble traitor,



The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings.

---

## GLOUCESTER:
So dear I loved the man, that I must weep.

---

I took him for the plainest harmless creature

That breathed upon this earth a Christian;

---

## BUCKINGHAM:
Well, well, he was the covert'st shelter'd traitor that ever lived.

---

Would you imagine, or almost believe,



This day had plotted, in the council-house

---

To murder me and my good Lord of Gloucester?

---

## GLOUCESTER:
How now, my lord, what say the citizens?

---

## BUCKINGHAM:
The citizens are mum and speak not a word.

---

## GLOUCESTER:
Touch'd you the bastardy of Edward's children?

---

## BUCKINGHAM:
I did; 



And his contract by deputy in France;

---

The insatiate greediness of his desires,



And his enforcement of the city wives;

---

His tyranny for trifles; his own bastardy,



His resemblance, being not like your father;

---

Withal I did infer your lineaments,



Both in your form and nobleness of mind;

---

Your dicipline in war, wisdom in peace,



Your bounty, virtue, fair humility:

---

And when mine oratory grew to an end



I bid them that did love their country's good

---

Cry 'God save Richard, England's royal king!'

---

## GLOUCESTER:
Ah! and did they so?

---

## BUCKINGHAM:
No, so God help me, they spake not a word;



But, like dumb statues or breathing stones,

---

Gazed each on other, and look'd deadly pale.



Which when I saw, I reprehended them;

---

## GLOUCESTER:
What tonguless blocks were they! would not they speak?

---

## BUCKINGHAM:
No, by my troth, my lord.



With the mayor here at hand: intend some fear;

---

Be not you spoke with, but by mighty suit:



And look you get a prayer-book in your hand,

---

And stand betwixt two churchmen, good my lord;



For on that ground I'll build a holy descant:

---

[Stately trumpet fanfare]

---

Welcome my lord; I dance attendance here;



I think the duke will not be spoke withal.

---

Here comes his servant: how now, Catesby,



What says he?

---

## CATESBY:
My lord: he doth entreat your grace;



To visit him to-morrow or next day:

---

He is within, with the right reverend father,



Divinely bent to meditation;

---

## BUCKINGHAM:
Return, good Catesby, to thy lord again;

---

Tell him, myself, the mayor and citizens,



Are come to have some conference with his grace.

---

## CATESBY:
I'll tell him what you say, my lord.

---

## BUCKINGHAM:
Ah, ha, my lord, this prince is not an Edward!

---

He is not lolling on a lewd day-bed,



But on his knees at meditation;

---

Not sleeping, to engross his idle body,



But praying, to enrich his watchful soul:

---

Happy were England, would this gracious prince



Take on himself the sovereignty thereof:

---

But, sure, I fear, we shall ne'er win him to it.

---

## LORD MAYOR:
Marry, God forbid his grace should say us nay!

---

## BUCKINGHAM:
I fear he will.



How now, Catesby, what says your lord?

---

## CATESBY:
My lord,

---

He wonders to what end you have assembled



Such troops of citizens to speak with him,

---

My lord, he fears you mean no good to him.

---

## BUCKINGHAM:
By heaven, I come in perfect love to him;



And so once more return and tell his grace.

---

When holy and devout religious men



Are at their beads, 'tis hard to draw them thence,

---

So sweet is zealous contemplation.

---

## LORD MAYOR:
See, where he stands beside the clergyman!

---

## BUCKINGHAM:
Two props of virtue for a Christian prince,



To stay him from the fall of vanity:

---

And, see, a book of prayer in his hand,



True ornaments to know a holy man. 

---

Famous devout Richard, most gracious prince,



Lend favourable ears to our request;

---

And pardon us the interruption



Of thy devotion and right Christian zeal.

---

## GLOUCESTER:
My lord, there needs no such apology:



I rather do beseech you pardon me,

---

Who, earnest in the service of my God,



Neglect the visitation of my friends.

---

But, leaving this, what is your grace's pleasure?

---

## BUCKINGHAM:
Even that, I hope, which pleaseth God above



And all good men of this ungoverned isle.

---

## GLOUCESTER:
I do suspect I have done some offense



And that you come to reprehend my ignorance.

---

## BUCKINGHAM:
Then know, it is your fault that you resign



The supreme seat, the throne majestical,

---

The scepter'd office of your ancestors,



Your state of fortune and your due of birth,

---

The lineal glory of your royal house,



To the corruption of a blemished stock:

[Crowd reacts]

---


Whilst, in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts,



Which here we waken to our country's good,

---

This noble isle doth want her proper limbs;



Her face defaced with scars of infamy,

[Crowd reacts]

---

And almost shoulder'd in the swallowing gulf



Of blind forgetfulness and dark oblivion.

---

Which to recure, we heartily solicit



Your gracious self to take on you the charge

---

And kingly government of this your land,



Not as protector, steward, substitute,

---

But as successively from blood to blood,



Your right of birth, your empery, your own.

[Crowd cheers]

---

## GLOUCESTER:
Your love deserves my thanks; but my desert



Unmeritable shuns your high request.

---

First if all obstacles were cut away,



And that my path were even to the crown,

---

As my ripe revenue and due by birth



Yet so much is my poverty of spirit,

---

So mighty and so many my defects,



As I had rather hide me from my greatness.

---

But, God be thank'd, there's no need of me,



And much I need to help you, if need were;

---

The royal tree hath left us royal fruit,



On him I lay what you would lay on me.

---

## BUCKINGHAM:
You say that Edward is your brother's son:



So say we too, but not by Edward's wife;

[Crowd hoots]

---

Then, good my lord, take to your royal self



This proffer'd benefit of dignity;

---

If not to bless us and the land withal,



Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry

---

From the corruption of abusing times,

---

## LORD MAYOR:
Do, good my lord, your citizens entreat you.

---

## BUCKINGHAM:
Refuse not, mighty lord, this proffer'd love.

---

## CATESBY:
O, make them joyful, grant our lawful suit!

[Crowd reacts]

---

## GLOUCESTER:
Alas, why would you heap these cares on me?



I am unfit for state and majesty;

---

## BUCKINGHAM:
If you refuse it,--as, in love and zeal,

---

Loath to depose the child, Your brother's son;



As well we know your tenderness of heart

---

Yet whether you accept our suit or no,



Your brother's son shall never reign our king;

[Crowd agrees]

---

But we will plant some other in the throne,



To the disgrace and downfall of your house:

---

And in this resolution here we leave you.--

---

Come, citizens: 'zounds! I'll entreat no more.

---

## LORD MAYOR:
Stay, citizens, stay!

---

Call them again, my lord, and accept their suit.



Do, good my lord, lest all the land do rue it.

---

## GLOUCESTER:
Would you enforce me to a world of care?



Well, call them again. I am not made of stone,

---

---

Cousin of Buckingham, and you sage, grave men,

---

Since you will buckle fortune on my back,



I must be brave and endure the load:

---

## LORD MAYOR:
God bless your grace!

---

## BUCKINGHAM:
Then I salute you with this kingly title:



Long live Richard, England's royal king!

---

## LORD MAYOR AND CITIZENS:
Long live Richard, England's royal king!

---

[A hunting horn]

Long live Richard, England's royal king!

---

[Chanting continues]

Long live Richard, England's royal king!

---
Long live Richard, England's royal king!

[Mournful music]

## DUCHESS OF YORK:
Daughter, well met.

---

## LADY ANNE:
God give your graces both



A happy and a joyful time of day!

---

## QUEEN ELIZABETH:
As much to you, good sister! Whither away?

---

## LADY ANNE:
No farther than the Tower; and, as I guess,

---

Upon the like devotion as yourselves,



To gratulate the gentle princes there.

---

## QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Kind sister, thanks: we'll enter all together.



And, in good time, here the lieutenant is.

---

Master lieutenant, pray you, by your leave,

---

How doth the prince, and my young son of York?

---

## BRAKENBURY:
Right well, dear madam. By your patience,

---

I may not allow you to visit them;



The king hath straitly charged the contrary.

---

## QUEEN ELIZABETH:
The king! why, who's that?

---

## BRAKENBURY:
I cry you mercy: I mean the lord protector.

---

## QUEEN ELIZABETH:
The Lord protect him from that kingly title!

---

Hath he set bounds betwixt their love and me?



I am their mother; who should keep me from them?

---

## DUCHESS OF YORK:
I am their fathers mother; I will see them.

---

## LADY ANNE:
Their aunt I am in law, in love their mother:

---

Then bring me to their sights; I'll bear thy blame



And take thy office from thee, on my peril.

---

## BRAKENBURY:
No, madam, no; I may not leave it so:



I am bound by oath, and therefore pardon me.

---

## STANLEY:
Let me but meet you, ladies, one hour hence,



And I'll salute your grace of York as mother,

---

And reverend looker on, of two fair queens.



Come, madam, you must straight to Westminster,

---

There to be crowned Richard's royal queen.

---

## QUEEN ELIZABETH:
O, cut my lace in sunder, that my pent heart

---

May have some scope to beat, or else I swoon



With this dead-killing news!

---

## LADY ANNE:
Despiteful tidings! O unpleasing news!

---

## DORSET:
Be of good cheer, mother: how fares your grace?

---

## QUEEN ELIZABETH:
O Dorset, speak not to me, get thee hence!

---

If thou wilt outstrip death, go cross the seas,

And live with Richmond, from the reach of hell

---

Go, hie thee, hie thee from this slaughter-house,



Lest thou increase the number of the dead;

---

And make me die the thrall of Margaret's curse,



Nor mother, wife, nor England's counted queen.

---

## STANLEY:
Full of wise care is this your counsel, madam.



Take all the swift advantage of the hours;

---

You shall have letters from me to my son



To meet you on the way, and welcome you.

---

Come, madam, come; I in all haste was sent.

---

## LADY ANNE:
And I in all unwillingness will go.

---

Anointed let me be with deadly venom,



And die, ere men can say, God save the queen!

---

## QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Go, go, poor soul, I envy not thy glory

---

## LADY ANNE:
No! why? When he that is my husband now



Came to me, as I follow'd Henry's corse,

---

When scarce the blood was well wash'd from his hands



Which issued from my other angel husband

---

And that dead saint which then I weeping follow'd;



O, when, I say, I look'd on Richard's face,

---

This was my wish: 'Be thou,' quoth I, ' accursed,



For making me, so young, so old a widow!

---

And, when thou wed'st, let sorrow haunt thy bed;



And be thy wife--if any be so mad--

---

As miserable by the life of thee



As thou hast made me by my dear lord's death!

---

Lo, ere I can repeat this curse again,



I am proved the subject of my own soul's curse,

---

Which ever since hath kept my eyes from rest;



For never yet one hour in his bed

---

Have I enjoy'd the golden dew of sleep,



But have been waked by his timorous dreams.

---

## QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Poor heart, adieu! I pity thy complaining.

---

## LADY ANNE:
No more than from my soul I mourn for yours.

---

## DUCHESS OF YORK:
Go thou to Richmond, and good fortune guide thee!



Go thou to Richard, and good angels guard thee!

---

Go thou to sanctuary, and good thoughts possess thee!



I to my grave, where peace and rest lie with me!

---

## QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Stay, yet look back with me unto the Tower.

---

---

Pity, you ancient stones, those tender babes



Whom envy hath immured within your walls!

---

Rough cradle for such little pretty ones!



Rude ragged nurse, old sullen playfellow

---

For tender princes, use my babies well!



So foolish sorrow bids your stones farewell.

## KING RICHARD III:
Cousin of Buckingham!

---

## BUCKINGHAM:
My gracious sovereign?

---

## KING RICHARD III:
Give me thy hand.

---

---

Thus high, by thy advice



And thy assistance, is King Richard seated;

---

But shall we wear these honours for a day?



Or shall they last, and we rejoice in them?

---

## BUCKINGHAM:
Still live they and for ever may they last!

---

## KING RICHARD III:
O Buckingham, now do I play the touch,



To try if thou be current gold indeed

---

Young Edward lives: think now what I would say.

---

## BUCKINGHAM:
Say on, my loving lord.

---

## KING RICHARD III:
Why, Buckingham, I say, I would be king,

---

## BUCKINGHAM:
Why, so you are, my thrice renowned liege.

---

## KING RICHARD III:
Ha! am I king? But young prince Edward lives.

---

## BUCKINGHAM:
Your grace may do your pleasure.

---

## KING RICHARD III:
Cousin, thou wert not wont to be so dull:



Shall I be plain? I wish the bastards dead;

---

And I would have it suddenly perform'd.



What sayest thou? speak suddenly; be brief.

---

## BUCKINGHAM:
Give me some breath, some little pause, my lord



Before I positively herein:

---

I will resolve your grace immediately.

---

---


## KING RICHARD III:
Ratcliffe!

---


## RATCLIFFE:
My lord?

---

## KING RICHARD III:
Know'st thou not any whom corrupting gold



Would tempt unto a close exploit of death?

---

## RATCLIFFE:
My lord, I know a discontented gentleman,



Whose humble means match not his haughty mind:

---

Gold were as good as twenty orators,



And will, no doubt, tempt him to any thing.

---

## KING RICHARD III:
What is his name?

---

## RATCLIFFE:
His name, my lord, is Lovell.

---

## KING RICHARD III:
I partly know the man: go, call him hither.

---

---

The deep-revolving witty Buckingham



No more shall be the neighbour to my counsel:

---

Hath he so long held out with me untired,



And stops he now for breath?

---

How now! what news with you?

---

## STANLEY:
My lord, I hear the Marquis Dorset's fled



To Richmond, in those parts beyond the sea



Where he abides.

---

## KING RICHARD III:
Catesby!

---

## CATESBY:
My lord?

---

## KING RICHARD III:
Rumour it abroad



That Anne, my wife, is sick and like to die:

---

I must be married to my brother's daughter,



Or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass.

---

Murder her brothers, and then marry her!



Uncertain way of gain! But I am in

---

So far in blood that sin will pluck on sin:



Tear-falling pity dwells not in this eye.

---

## LOVELL:
Your most obedient subject.

---

## KING RICHARD III:
Art thou, indeed?

---

## LOVELL:
Prove me, my gracious sovereign.

---

## KING RICHARD III:
Darest thou resolve to kill a friend of mine?

---

## LOVELL:
For you my lord;



I had rather kill two enemies.

---

## KING RICHARD III:
Why, there thou hast it: two deep enemies,



Foes to my rest and my sweet sleep's disturbers

---

Are they that I would have thee deal upon:



Lovell, I mean those bastards in the Tower.

---

## LOVELL:
Let me have open means to come to them,



And soon I'll rid you from the fear of them.

---

## KING RICHARD III:
Thou sing'st sweet music. Hark, come hither, Lovell

---

Go, by this token: say it is done,



And I will love thee, and prefer thee too.

---

## LOVELL:
'Tis done, my gracious lord.

---

## KING RICHARD III:
Shall we hear from thee, Lovell, ere we sleep?

---

## LOVELL:
Ye shall, my Lord.

---

---

## BUCKINGHAM:
My Lord, I have consider'd in my mind



The late demand that you did sound me in.

---

## KING RICHARD III:
Well, let that pass. Dorset is fled to Richmond.

---

## BUCKINGHAM:
I hear that news, my lord.

---

My lord, I claim your gift, my due by promise,



For which your honour and your faith is pawn'd;

---

The earldom of Hereford and the moveables



The which you promised I should possess.

---

What says your highness to my just demand?

---

## KING RICHARD III:
As I remember, Henry the Sixth



Did prophesy that Richmond should be king,

---

When Richmond was a little peevish boy.



A king, perhaps, perhaps,--

---

## BUCKINGHAM:
My lord!

---

## KING RICHARD III:
How chance the prophet could not at that time



Have told me, I being by, that I should kill him?

---

## BUCKINGHAM:
My lord, your promise for the earldom,--

---

## KING RICHARD III:
Ay, what's o'clock?

---

## BUCKINGHAM:
I am thus bold to put your grace in mind



Of what you promised me.

---

## KING RICHARD III:
Well, but what's o'clock?

---

## BUCKINGHAM:
Upon the stroke of ten.

---

## KING RICHARD III:
Well, let it strike.

---

## BUCKINGHAM:
Why let it strike?

---

## KING RICHARD III:
Because that, like a Jack, thou keep'st the stroke



Betwixt thy begging and my meditation.

---

I am not in the giving vein to-day.

---

## BUCKINGHAM:
Why, then resolve me whether you will or no.

---

## KING RICHARD III:
Tut, tut,



Thou troublest me; am not in the vein.

---

---


## BUCKINGHAM:
Is it even so? rewards he my true service



With such deep contempt made I him king for this?

---

O, let me think on Hastings, and be gone



To Brecknock, while my fearful head is on!

---

[Drumming]

---

## LOVELL:
The tyrannous and bloody deed is done.

---

The most arch deed of piteous massacre



That ever yet this land was guilty of.

---

Thus both are gone with conscience and remorse;



And now he comes, the bloody king.

---

## KING RICHARD III:
Kind Lovell, am I happy in thy news?

---

## LOVELL:
If to have done the thing you gave in charge



Beget your happiness, be happy then,

---

For it is done, my lord.

---

## KING RICHARD III:
Come to me, Lovell, soon at after supper,



And thou shalt tell the process of their death.

---

Meantime, but think how I may do thee good,



And be inheritor of thy desire.

---

Farewell till soon.

---

---


The sons of Edward sleep in Abraham's bosom,



And Anne my wife hath bid the world good night.

---

Now, for I know the Breton Richmond aims



His sights at Elizabeth’s maiden daughter,

---

And, by that knot, looks proudly o'er the crown,



To her I go, a jolly thriving wooer.

---

## CATESBY:
My lord!

---

## KING RICHARD III:
Good news or bad, that thou comest in so bluntly?

---

## CATESBY:
Bad news, my lord: Ely is fled to Richmond;

---

And Buckingham, back'd with the hardy Welshmen,



Is in the field, and still his power increaseth.

---

## KING RICHARD III:
Come, I have heard that fearful commenting



Is leaden servitor to dull delay;

---

Come, muster men: my counsel is my shield;



We must be brief when traitors brave the field.

---

[Mournful music and drumming]

---

---


## QUEEN MARGARET:
So, now prosperity begins to mellow



And drop into the rotten mouth of death.

---

A dire induction am I witness to,



And will to France, hoping the consequence

---

Will prove as bitter, black, and tragical.



Withdraw thee, wretched Margaret: 

---

[Wailing cries offstage]

---

## QUEEN MARARET:
Who comes here?

---

## QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Ah, my young princes! ah, my tender babes!

---

If yet your gentle souls fly in the air



Hover about me with your airy wings

---

And hear your mother's lamentation!

---

Wilt thou, O God, fly from such gentle lambs,



And throw them in the entrails of the wolf?

---

When didst thou sleep when such a deed was done?

---

## DUCHESS OF YORK:
Blind sight, dead life, poor mortal living ghost,

---

Rest thy unrest on England's lawful earth,



Unlawfully made drunk with innocents' blood!

---

## QUEEN ELIZABETH:
O, who hath any cause to mourn but I?

---

## QUEEN MARGARET:
If ancient sorrow be most reverend,



Give mine the benefit of seniory,

---

Tell o'er your woes again by viewing mine:



I had an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him;

---

I had a Harry, till a Richard kill'd him:

---

Thou hadst an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him;

---

Thou hadst a Richard, till a Richard killed him;

---

Thou hadst a Clarence too, and Richard kill'd him.

---

From forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept



A hell-hound that doth hunt us all to death:

---

O upright, just, and true-disposing God,



How do I thank thee, that this carnal cur

---

Preys on the issue of his mother's body,



And the beholders of this tragic play,

---

The adulterate Hastings, Rivers, Grey,



Untimely smother'd in their dusky graves.

---

Richard yet lives, hell's black intelligencer,



Cancel his bond of life, dear God, I pray,

---

That one may live to say, the dog is dead!

---

## QUEEN ELIZABETH:
O, thou didst prophesy the time would come

---

That I should wish for thee to help me curse



That bottled spider, that foul bunch-back'd toad!

---

## QUEEN MARGARET:
I call'd thee then vain flourish of my fortune;

---

Where is thy husband now? where be thy brothers?



Where are thy children? wherein dost thou, joy?

---

Who sues to thee and cries 'God save the queen'?



Where be the bending peers that flatter'd thee?

---

Where be the thronging troops that follow'd thee?



Decline all this, and see what now thou art:

---

For happy wife, a most distressed widow;



For joyful mother, one that wails the name;

---

For queen, a very cowrd crown'd with care;



For one being sued to, one that humbly sues;

---

For one that scorn'd at me, now scorn'd of me;



For one being fear'd of all, now fearing one;

---

For one commanding all, obey'd of none.



Thus hath the course of justice wheel'd about,

---

And left thee but a very prey to time;

---

## QUEEN ELIZABETH:
O thou well skill'd in curses, stay awhile,



And teach me how to curse mine enemies!

---

## QUEEN MARGARET:
Forbear to sleep the nights, and fast the days;



Compare dead happiness with living woe;

---

Think that thy babes were fairer than they were,



And he that slew them fouler than he is:

---

Bettering thy loss makes the bad causer worse:



Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.

---

## QUEEN ELIZABETH:
My words are dull; O, quicken them with thine!

---

## QUEEN MARGARET:
Thy woes will make them sharp, and pierce like mine.

---

## DUCHESS OF YORK:
Why should calamity be full of words?

---

## QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Poor breathing orators of miseries!

---

Let them have scope: though what they do impart



Help not all, yet do they ease the heart.

---

## DUCHESS OF YORK:
If so, then be not tongue-tied: go with me.

---

And in the breath of bitter words let's smother



My damned son, which thy two sweet sons smother'd.

---

I hear his drum: be copious in exclaims.

---

[Drumming]

---

## KING RICHARD III:
Who intercepts me?

---

## DUCHESS OF YORK:
O, she that might have intercepted thee,



By strangling thee in her accursed womb

---

From all the slaughters, wretch, that thou hast done!

---

## QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Hidest thou that forehead with a golden crown,



Where should be graven, if that right were right,

---

The slaughter of the prince that owed that crown,



And the dire death of my two sons and brothers?

---

Tell me, thou villain slave, where are my children?

---

## DUCHESS OF YORK:
Thou toad, thou toad, where is thy brother Clarence?

---

## QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Where is kind Hastings, Rivers, Grey?

---

## DUCHESS OF YORK:
Art thou my son?

---

## KING RICHARD III:
Ay, I thank God, my father, and yourself.

---

## DUCHESS OF YORK:
O, then let me speak!

---

## KING RICHARD III:
Be brief, good mother; for I am in haste.

---

## DUCHESS OF YORK:
Art thou so hasty? I have stay'd for thee,



God knows, in anguish, pain and agony.

---

## KING RICHARD III:
And came I not at last to comfort you?

---

## DUCHESS OF YORK:
No, by the holy rood, thou know'st it well,



Thou camest on earth to make the earth my hell.

---

A grievous burthen was thy birth to me;



Tetchy and wayward was thy infancy;

---

Thy school-days frightful, desperate, wild, and furious,

---

Thy prime of manhood daring, bold, and venturous,

---

Thy age confirm'd, proud, subdued, bloody,

treacherous,

---

More mild, but yet more harmful, kind in hatred:

---

What comfortable hour canst thou name,



That ever graced me in thy company?

---

## KING RICHARD III:
Faith, none, but If I be so disgracious in your sight,



Let me march on, and not offend your grace.

---

## DUCHESS OF YORK:
I prithee, hear me speak.

---

## KING RICHARD III:
You speak too bitterly.

---

## DUCHESS OF YORK:
Hear me a word;



For I shall never speak to thee again.

---

## KING RICHARD III:
So.

---

## DUCHESS OF YORK:
Either thou wilt die, by God's just ordinance,



Ere from this war thou turn a conqueror,

---

Or I with grief and extreme age shall perish



And never look upon thy face again.

---

Therefore take with thee my most heavy curse;



My prayers on the adverse party fight;

---

And there the little souls of Edward's children



Whisper the spirits of thine enemies

---

And promise them success and victory.



Bloody thou art, bloody will be thy end;

---

Shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend.

---

## QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Though far more cause, yet much less spirit to curse abides in me; I say amen to all.

---

## KING RICHARD III:
Stay, madam; I must speak a word with you.

---

## QUEEN ELIZABETH:
I have no more sons of the royal blood


For thee to murder: 

---

for my daughters, Richard,



They shall be praying nuns, not weeping queens;

---

## KING RICHARD III:
You have a daughter call'd Elizabeth,



Virtuous and fair, royal and gracious.

---

## QUEEN ELIZABETH:
And must she die for this? O, let her live,



And I'll corrupt her manners, stain her beauty;

---

I will confess she was not Edward's daughter.

---

## KING RICHARD III:
Wrong not her birth, she is of royal blood.

---

## QUEEN ELIZABETH:
To save her life, I'll say she is not so.

---

## KING RICHARD III:
Her life is only safest in her birth.

---

## QUEEN ELIZABETH:
And only in that safety died her brothers.

---

## KING RICHARD III:
You speak as if that I had slain my nephews.

---

## QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Nephews, indeed; and by their uncle cozen'd



Of comfort, kingdom, kindred, freedom, life.

---

No doubt the murderous knife was dull and blunt



Till it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart,

---

To revel in the entrails of my lambs.

---

## KING RICHARD III:
Madam, I intend more good to you and yours,



Than ever you or yours were by me wrong'd!

---

## QUEEN ELIZABETH:
What good  that can do me good?

---

## KING RICHARD III:
The advancement of your children, gentle lady.

---

## QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Up to some scaffold, there to lose their heads?

---

## KING RICHARD III:
No, to the dignity and height of honour

---

## QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Be brief, lest that be process of thy kindness



Last longer telling than thy kindness' date.

---

## KING RICHARD III:
Then know, that from my soul I love thy daughter.



And mean to make her queen of England.

---

## QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Say then, who dost thou mean shall be her king?

---

## KING RICHARD III:
Even he that makes her queen who should be else?

---

## QUEEN ELIZABETH:
What, thou?

---

## KING RICHARD III:
I, even I: what think you of it, madam?

---

## QUEEN ELIZABETH:
How canst thou woo her?

---

## KING RICHARD III:
That would I learn of you,

---

## QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Send to her, by the man that slew her brothers,

---

A pair of bleeding-hearts; thereon engrave



Edward and York; then haply she will weep:

---

If this inducement force her not to love,



Send her a story of thy noble acts;

---

Tell her thou madest away her uncle Clarence,



Her uncle Rivers; yea, and, for her sake,

---

Madest quick conveyance with her good aunt Anne.

---

## KING RICHARD III:
Come, come, you mock me; this is not the way



To win your daughter.

---

## QUEEN ELIZABETH:
There is no other way



Unless thou couldst put on some other shape,

---

And not be Richard that hath done all this.

---

## KING RICHARD III:
Look, what is done cannot be now amended:



Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes,

---

If I did take the kingdom from your sons,



To make amends, Ill give it to your daughter.

---

If I have kill'd the issue of your womb,



To quicken your increase, I will beget

---

Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter

---

Your children were vexation to your youth,



But mine shall be a comfort to your age.

---

The loss you have is but a son being king,



And by that loss your daughter is made queen.

---

And when this arm of mine hath chastised



The petty rebel, dull-brain'd Buckingham,

---

Bound with triumphant garlands will I come



And lead thy daughter to a conqueror's bed;

---

## QUEEN ELIZABETH:
What were I best to say? her father's brother



Would be her lord? or shall I say, her uncle?

---

Or, he that slew her brothers and her uncles?



Under what title shall I woo for thee?

---

## KING RICHARD III:
Say, she shall be a high and mighty queen.

---

## QUEEN ELIZABETH:
To wail the tide, as her mother doth.

---

## KING RICHARD III:
Say, I will love her everlastingly.

---

## QUEEN ELIZABETH:
But how long shall that title 'ever' last?

---

## KING RICHARD III:
So long as heaven and nature lengthens it.

---

## QUEEN ELIZABETH:
So long as hell and Richard likes of it..

---

## KING RICHARD III:
Be eloquent in my behalf to her.



Now, by my George, my garter, and my crown,--

---

## QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Profaned, dishonour'd, and the third usurp'd.

---

## KING RICHARD III:
I swear—



## QUEEN ELIZABETH:
By nothing; for this is no oath:

---

The George, profaned, hath lost his holy honour;



The garter, blemish'd, pawn'd his knightly virtue;

---

The crown, usurp'd, disgraced his kingly glory.



if something thou wilt swear to be believed,

---

Swear then by something that thou hast not wrong'd.

---

## KING RICHARD III:
Now, by the world—



## QUEEN ELIZABETH:
'Tis full of thy foul wrongs.

---

## KING RICHARD III:
Then, by myself—



## QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Thyself thyself misusest.

---

## KING RICHARD III:
Why then, by God—

---

## QUEEN ELIZABETH:
God's wrong is most of all.



What canst thou swear by now?

---

## KING RICHARD III:
The time to come.

---

## QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Swear not by time to come; for that thou hast



Misused ere used, by time misused o'erpast.

---

## KING RICHARD III:
As I intend to prosper and repent,



So thrive I in my dangerous attempt.

---

In her consists my happiness and thine;



Without her, follows to this land and me,

---

To thee, herself, and many a Christian soul,



Death, desolation, ruin and decay:

---

It cannot be avoided but by this;



It will not be avoided but by this.

---

Therefore, good mother,--I must call you so--



Plead what I will be, not what I have been;

---

## QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Shall I be tempted of the devil thus?

---

## KING RICHARD III:
Ay, if the devil tempt thee to do good.

---

## QUEEN ELIZABETH:
But thou didst kill my children.

---

## KING RICHARD III:
But in your daughter's womb I bury them:

---

## QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Shall I go win my daughter to thy will?

---

## KING RICHARD III:
And be a happy mother by the deed.

---

Bear her my true love's kiss; and so, farewell.

---

---



Relenting fool, and shallow, changing woman!

---

How now! what news?

---

## RATCLIFF:
My gracious sovereign, on the western coast



Rideth a puissant navy; to our shores.

---

'Tis thought that Richmond is their admiral;



And there they hull, expecting but the aid

---

Of Buckingham to welcome them ashore.

---

## KING RICHARD III:
Catesby; where is he?

---

## CATESBY:
Here, my lord.

---

## KING RICHARD III:
O, true, good Catesby:


---

Meet me presently at Salisbury.

---

## CATESBY:
I go.

---

## KING RICHARD III:
How now, what news with you?

---

## STANLEY:
Richmond is on the seas.

---

## KING RICHARD III:
There let him sink, and be the seas on him!



What doth he there?

---

## STANLEY:
I know not, mighty sovereign, but by guess.

---

## KING RICHARD III:
Well, sir, as you guess, as you guess?

---

## STANLEY:
He makes for England, there to claim the crown.

---

## KING RICHARD III:
Is the king dead? the empire unpossess'd?



What heir of York is there alive but we?

---

Then, tell me, what doth he upon the sea?

---

## STANLEY:
Unless for that, my liege, I cannot guess.

---

## KING RICHARD III:
Thou wilt revolt, and fly to him, I fear.

---

## STANLEY:
No, mighty liege; therefore mistrust me not.

---

## KING RICHARD III:
Ay, ay. thou wouldst be gone to join with Richmond:



I will not trust you, sir.

---

## STANLEY:
Most mighty sovereign,



You have no cause to hold my friendship doubtful:

---

I never was nor never will be false.

---

## KING RICHARD III:
Well, go muster men; but, hear you, leave behind



Your son, George: look your faith be firm.

---

Or else his head's assurance is but frail.

---

## STANLEY:
So deal with him as I prove true to you.


---

---

## MESSENGER:
My gracious sovereign, now in Devonshire,



Sir Edward Courtney, and the haughty prelate

---

Bishop of Exeter, his brother there,



With many more confederates, are in arms.

---

## MESSENGER:
My liege, in Kent the Guildfords are in arms;

---

And every hour more competitors



Flock to their aid, and still their power increaseth.

---

## MESSENGER:
My lord, the army of the Duke of Buckingham—

---

## KING RICHARD III:
Out on you, owls! nothing but songs of death?

---

Take that, until thou bring me better news.

---

## MESSENGER:
The news I have to tell your majesty



Is, that by sudden floods and fall of waters,

---

Buckingham's army is dispersed and scatter'd;

---

## KING RICHARD III:
I cry thee mercy:



There is my purse to cure that blow of thine.

---

## MESSENGER 
Sir William Brandon and Lord Marquis Dorset,



'Tis said, my liege, in Yorkshire are in arms.

---

Yet this good comfort bring I to your grace,



The Breton navy is dispersed by tempest:

---

## KING RICHARD III:
March on, march on, since we are up in arms;

---

If not to fight with foreign enemies,



Yet to beat down these rebels here at home.

---

## RATCLIFFE:
My liege, the Duke of Buckingham is taken;



That is the best news: that the Earl of Richmond

---

Is with a mighty power landed at Milford,



Is colder tidings, yet they must be told.

---

## KING RICHARD III:
Away towards Salisbury! while we reason here,



A royal battle might be won and lost

---

---


## STANLEY:
Good servant, tell Richmond this from me:

---

My son George is frank'd up in hold:



If I revolt, off goes young George's head;

---

The fear of that withholds my present aid.



Return unto Richmond; commend me to him:

---

Tell him the queen hath heartily consented



He shall marry Elizabeth her daughter.

---

These letters will resolve him of my mind. Farewell.

---

[Drumming]

---

[Slow drum beat]

---

## BUCKINGHAM:
Will not King Richard let me speak with him?

---

## BRAKENBURY:
No, my good lord; therefore be patient.

---

## BUCKINGHAM:
This is All-Souls' day, fellow, is it not?

---

## BRAKENBURY:
It is, my lord.

---

## BUCKINGHAM:
Why, then All-Souls' day is my body's doomsday.

---

[Chuckles]



This is the day that, in King Edward's time,

---

I wish't might fall on me, when I was found



False to his children or his wife's allies

---

This is the day wherein I wish'd to fall



By the false faith of him I trusted most;

---

This, this All-Souls' day to my fearful soul



Is the determined respite of my wrongs:

---

That high All-Seer that I dallied with



Hath turn'd my feigned prayer on my head

---

And given in earnest what I begg'd in jest.



Thus doth he force the swords of wicked men

---

To turn their own points on their masters' bosoms:



Now Margaret's curse is fallen upon my head;

---

'When he,' quoth she, 'shall split thy heart with sorrow, remember Margaret was a prophetess.'

---

Come, sir, convey me to the block of shame;



Wrong hath but wrong, and blame the due of blame.

---

[Drumming]

---

[Trumpet fanfare]

---



---

## RICHMOND:
Fellows in arms, and my most loving friends,



Bruised underneath the yoke of tyranny,

---

The wretched, bloody, and usurping king,



Lies now even in the centre of this isle.

---

In God's name, cheerly on, courageous friends,



To reap the harvest of perpetual peace

---

By this one bloody trial of sharp war.



True hope is swift, and flies with swallow's wings:

---

Kings it makes gods, and meaner creatures kings.

---



---

[Distant thunder]

---

## KING RICHARD III:
Here pitch our tents, even here in Bosworth field.



My Lord Ratcliffe, why look you so sad?

---

## RATCLIFFE:
My heart is ten times lighter than my looks.

---

## KING RICHARD III:
Ratcliffe, we must have knocks; ha! must we not?

---

## RATCLIFFE:
We must both give and take, my gracious lord.

---

## KING RICHARD III:
Up with my tent there! here will I lie tonight;



But where to-morrow? Well, all's one for that.

---

Who hath descried the number of the foe?

---

## RATCLIFFE:
Six or seven thousand is their utmost power.

---

## KING RICHARD III:
Why, our battalion trebles that account:



Besides, the king's name is a tower of strength,

---

Which they upon the adverse party want.



Let us survey the vantage of the field

---

Let's want no discipline, make no delay,



For, lords, to-morrow is a busy day.

---

[Distant thunder continues]

---

## RICHMOND:
The weary sun hath made a golden set,



And by the bright track of his fiery car,

---

Gives signal, of a goodly day to-morrow.



Yet one thing more, Dorset, before thou go'st,

---

Where is Lord Stanley quarter'd, dost thou know?

---

## DORSET:
Unless I have mista'en his colours much,



Which well I am assured I have not done,

---

His regiment lies half a mile at least



South from the mighty power of the king.

---

## RICHMOND:
If without peril it be possible,



Good Dorset, bear my good-night to him,

---

And give him from me this most needful scroll.

---

## DORSET:
Upon my life, my lord, I'll under-take it;



And so, God give you quiet rest to-night!

---

## RICHMOND:
Come, Dorset, Let us consult upon to-morrow's business in to our tent; the air is raw and cold.

---



[Rolling thunder]

---

## KING RICHARD III:
What is't o'clock?

---

## CATESBY:
It's supper-time, my lord;



It's nine o'clock.

---

## KING RICHARD III:
I will not sup to-night.



Give me some ink and paper.

---

## KING RICHARD III:
Catesby!

---

## CATESBY:
My lord?

---

## KING RICHARD III:
Send out a man at arms



To Stanley's regiment; bid him bring his power

---

Before sunrising, lest his son George fall



Into the blind cave of eternal night.

---

Ratcliff! 



Give me a bowl of wine:

---

I have not that alacrity of spirit,



Nor cheer of mind, that I was wont to have.

---

Set it down. Is ink and paper ready?

---

## RATCLIFF:
It is, my lord.

---

## KING RICHARD III:
Bid my guard watch; leave me.

---

Ratcliff, about the mid of night come to my tent



And help to arm me. Leave me, I say.

---

---


## STANLEY:
Fortune and victory sit on thy helm!

---

## RICHMOND:
All comfort that the dark night can afford



Be to thy person, noble father-in-law!

---

Tell me, how fares our loving mother?

---

## STANLEY:
I, by attorney, bless thee from his mother



Who prays continually for Richmond's good:

---

Prepare thy battle early in the morning,



And put thy fortune to the arbitrement

---

Of bloody strokes and mortal-staring war.



I, as I may--that which I would I cannot,--

---

With best advantage will deceive the time,



And aid thee in this doubtful shock of arms:

---

But on thy side I may not be too forward



Lest, being seen, my dear son, tender George,

---

Be executed in his father's sight.



Once more, adieu: be valiant, and speed well!

---

## RICHMOND:
Good Dorset, conduct him to his regiment:



I'll strive, with troubled thoughts, to take a nap,

---

Lest leaden slumber peise me down to-morrow,



When I should mount with wings of victory:

---

Once more, good night, kind lords and gentlemen.

---

---

## RICHMOND:
O Thou, whose captain I account myself,

---

Look on my forces with a gracious eye;



Put in their hands thy bruising irons of wrath,

---

That they may crush down with a heavy fall



The usurping helmets of our adversaries!

---

Make us thy ministers of chastisement,



That we may praise thee in the victory!

---

To thee I do commend my watchful soul,

---

Ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes:



Sleeping and waking, O, defend me still!

---

---

[Angry ghosts whisper]

---

## CLARENCE:
[Gasping] Let me sit heavy on thy soul to-morrow!



Poor Clarence, by thy guile betrayed to death!

---

To-morrow in the battle think on me,



And fall thy edgeless sword: despair, and die!--

---

---

Thou offspring of the house of Lancaster



The wronged heirs of York do pray for thee

---

Good angels guard thy battle! Live, and flourish!

---

## RIVERS:
Let me sit heavy on thy soul to-morrow,



Rivers. That died at Pomfret! Despair, and die!

---

## GREY:
Think upon Grey, and let thy soul despair!

---

---

## RIVERS:
Awake,

---

## GREY:
And think our wrongs in Richard’s bosom



Will conquer him!

---

## RIVERS:
Awake, and win the day!

---

---

## YORK:
Dream on thy cousins smother’d in the Tower:

---

## PRINCE EDWARD:
Let us be led within thy bosom, Richard,



And weigh thee down to ruin, shame, and death!

---

## YORK:
Thy nephews’ souls bid thee despair and die!

---

---

## PRINCE EDWARD:
Sleep, Richmond, sleep in peace, and wake in joy;



Good angels guard thee from the boar’s annoy!

---

## YORK:
Live, and beget a happy race of kings!

---

## YORK AND PRINCE EDWARD:
Edward’s unhappy sons do bid thee flourish.

---

---

## LADY ANNE:
Richard, thy wife, that wretched Anne thy wife,



That never slept a quiet hour with thee,

---

Now fills thy sleep with perturbations



To-morrow in the battle think on me,

---

And fall thy edgeless sword: despair, and die!

---

---

Thou quiet soul, sleep thou a quiet sleep

---

Dream of success and happy victory!

---

Thy adversary’s wife doth pray for thee.

---

---

## BUCKINGHAM:
[Choking] The first was I that helped thee to the crown;



The last was I that felt thy tyranny:

---

O, in the battle think on Buckingham,



And die in terror of thy guiltiness!

---

Dream on, dream on, of bloody deeds and death:



Fainting, despair; despairing, yield thy breath!

---

---

God and good angel fight on Richmond’s side;

---

And Richard falls in height of all his pride.

---

[Distant thunder]

---

## KING RICHARD III:
Give me another horse: bind up my wounds.



Have mercy, Jesu!

---

--Soft! I did but dream.

---

O coward conscience, how dost thou afflict me!



The lights burn blue. It is now dead midnight.

---

Cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh.



My conscience hath a thousand several tongues,

---

And every tongue brings in a several tale,



And every tale condemns me for a villain.

---

Perjury, perjury, in the high'st degree



Murder, stern murder, in the direst degree;

---

All several sins, all used in each degree,



Throng to the bar, crying all, Guilty! 

---

Guilty!

---

I shall despair. 

---

There is no creature loves me;



And if I die, no soul shall pity me:

---

Nay, wherefore should they, since that I myself



Find in myself no pity to myself?

---

Methought the souls of all that I had murder'd



Came to my tent; and every one did threat

---

To-morrow's vengeance on the head of Richard.

---

---

## RATCLIFF:
My lord!

---

## KING RICHARD III:
Who is there?

---

## RATCLIFF:
Ratcliff, my lord; 'tis I. 



Your friends are up, and buckle on their armour.

---

## KING RICHARD III:
O Ratcliff, I have dream'd a fearful dream!



What thinkest thou, will our friends prove all true?

---

## RATCLIFF:
No doubt, my lord.

---

## KING RICHARD III:
O Ratcliff, I fear, I fear,--

---

## RATCLIFF:
Nay, good my lord, be not afraid of shadows.

---

## KING RICHARD III:
By the apostle Paul, shadows to-night



Have struck more terror to the soul of Richard

---

Than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers



It is not yet near day. Come, go with me;


---

---

## DORSET:
Good morrow, Richmond!

---

## RICHMOND:
Cry mercy, Dorset,



That you have ta'en a tardy sluggard here.

---

## DORSET:
How have you slept, my lord?

---

## RICHMOND:
The sweetest sleep, and fairest-boding dreams



That ever enter'd in a drowsy head.

---

Methought their souls, whose bodies Richard murder'd,



Came to my tent, and cried on victory:

---

I promise you, my soul is very jocund



In the remembrance of so fair a dream.

---

How far into the morning is it, lords?

---

## DORSET:
Upon the stroke of four.

---

## RICHMOND:
Why, then 'tis time to arm and give direction.

---

[Crowd noises]

---

Remember this,



God and our good cause fight upon our side;

---

The prayers of holy saints and wronged souls,



Like high-rear'd bulwarks, stand before our faces;

---

For what is he they follow? truly, gentlemen,



A bloody tyrant and a homicide;

---

One raised in blood, and one in blood establish'd;



One that made means to come by what he hath,

---

And slaughter'd those that were the means to help him;


One that hath ever been God's enemy:

---

Then, if you fight against God's enemy,



God will in justice ward you as his soldiers;

---

Then, in the name of God and all these rights,



Advance your standards, draw your willing swords.

---

For me, the ransom of my bold attempt



Shall be this cold corpse on the earth's cold face;

---

Sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully;



God and Saint George! Richmond and victory!

---

[A hunting horn signals]
[Crowd cheers]

---
---

## KING RICHARD III:
Who saw the sun to-day?

---

## RATCLIFF:
Not I, my lord.

---

## KING RICHARD III:
Then he disdains to shine; for by the book



He should have braved the east an hour ago

---

A black day will it be to somebody. Ratcliff!

---

## RATCLIFF:
My lord?

---

## KING RICHARD III:
The sun will not be seen to-day;



The sky doth frown and lour upon our army.

---

I would these dewy tears were from the ground.



Call up Lord Stanley, bid him bring his power:

---

[Crowd noises]

---

What shall I say more than I have inferr'd?



Remember whom you are to cope withal;

---

A sort of vagabonds, rascals, and runaways,



A scum of Bretons, and base lackey peasants,

---

And who doth lead them but a paltry fellow,



A milk-sop, one that never in his life

---

Felt so much cold as over shoes in snow?



If we be conquer'd, let men conquer us,

---

And not these bastard Bretons; whom our fathers



And in record, left them the heirs of shame.

---

Shall these enjoy our lands? 

---

Lie with our wives?

---

Ravish our daughters?

---

[Snare drum march]

---

Fight, gentlemen of England! fight, bold yoemen!

---

Draw, archers, draw your arrows to the head!



Spur your proud horses hard, and ride in blood;

---

[Crowd cheers]

---

## KING RICHARD III:
What says Lord Stanley? will he bring his power?

---

## RATCLIFF:
My lord, he doth deny to come.

---

## KING RICHARD III:
Off with his son George's head!

---

## RATCLIFF:
My lord, the enemy is past the marsh



After the battle let George Stanley die.

---

## KING RICHARD III:
A thousand hearts are great within my bosom:



Advance our standards, set upon our foes

---

Our ancient word of courage, fair Saint George,



Inspire us with the strength of fiery dragons!

---

Upon them! victory sits on our helms.

---

[Crowd roars]

---

[Thunder clap]

---

[Sounds of a raging battle]

---

## CATESBY:
Rescue, my Lord Stanley, rescue, rescue!


The king enacts more wonders than a man,

---

Daring an opposite to every danger:



His horse is slain, and all on foot he fights,

---

Seeking for Richmond in the throat of death.



Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost!

---
[Swords clanging]

---
[Shouts and battle cries]

---

## KING RICHARD III:
A horse! A horse! My kingdom for a horse!

---

## CATESBY:
Withdraw, my lord; I’ll help you to a horse.

---

## KING RICHARD III:
Slave, I have set my life upon a cast,



And I will stand the hazard of the die:

---

I think there be six Richmonds in the field;



Five have I slain to-day instead of him.

---

A horse! A horse! My kingdom for a horse!

---

## RICHMOND:
Richard!

---

[Screams and clashing metal]

---

[Thunder clap]

---

## STANLEY:
Courageous Richmond, well hast thou acquit thee.

---

Lo, here, this long-usurped royalty



From the dead temples of this bloody wretch

---

Have I pluck'd off, to grace thy brows withal:



Wear it, enjoy it, and make much of it.

---

## RICHMOND:
Great God of heaven, say Amen to all!



But, tell me, is young George living?

---

## STANLEY:
He is, my lord, and safe.

---

## RICHMOND:
Proclaim a pardon to the soldiers fled



That in submission will return to us:

---

England hath long been mad, and scarr'd herself;



The brother blindly shed the brother's blood,

---

The father rashly slaughter'd his own son,



The son, compell'd, been butcher to the sire:

---

[Crowd cheering]

---

## ELIZABETH: 
All this divided York and Lancaster,



Divided in their dire division,

---

O, let Richmond and Elizabeth’s daughter,



The true succeeders of each royal house,

---

By God's fair ordinance conjoin together!

---

## RICHMOND:
And let their heirs, God, if thy will be so.



Enrich the time to come with smooth-faced peace,

---

With smiling plenty and fair prosperous days!



Abate the edge of traitors, gracious Lord,

---

That would reduce these bloody days again,



And make poor England weep in streams of blood!

---

Now civil wounds are stopp'd, peace lives again:



That she may long live here, God say amen!

---

## SOLDIERS:
Amen!

---

## RICHMOND:
God and your arms be praised, victorious friends,



The day is ours, the bloody dog is dead!

---

[Crowd cheers]
