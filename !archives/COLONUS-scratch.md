## THESEUS:
Think no longer that you are in command here,
But, rather, think how when you were
You served your own destruction.

---


Welcome, brothers and sisters.

---


I take as my text this evening the Book of Oedipus.

---


Oedipus! Dammed in his birth, in his marriage damned,
Dammed by the blood he shed with his own hand!

---


Oedipus! A man so pitifully ensnared in the net of his own life’s destiny…
Net of incest, mingling wives, sisters, mothers,
With fathers, sons, brothers.

---


You have all heard of the death of Jocasta. Jocasta.

---


Whose husband was by her husband,
Whose children were by her child.

---


You have heard how the wretched Oedipus found her body swaying
From the cruel cord she had noosed about her neck.

---


How a great sob broke from him, heartbreaking to hear,
As he loosed the rope and lowered her body to the ground.

---


I would blot out from my mind what happened next!

---


For they say this King ripped from her gown the golden brooches
That were her ornaments, and raised them on high, and plunged
them down
Straight into his own eyeballs, crying, “No more,
No more shall you look on the misery about me,
The horrors of my own doing! Too long you have known
The faces of those whom I never should have seen,
Too long been blind to those for whom I was searching!

---


From this hour, go in darkness!”
And as he spoke, he struck at his eyes—
Not once, but many times; they say the blood burst
From his ruined sockets like red hail.

---


Net of blood! His father’s blood,
His own blood, shed by his own hand.

---


In Exodus where it speaks of his death in a place called
Colonus…which was sacred..

---


And his redemption there…
We direct you to lines 275 through 279,
Wherein he cries out to his daughters:
“I could say much to you if you could understand me.

---


But as it is, I have only this prayer for you:
Live where you can. Be as happy as you can –
Happier, please God, than God has made your father.”
Amen.

---

## CHORUS:
Don’t go…away…
Father…won’t you stay…
Don’t go…away…
Father…won’t you stay…
Ooh…Ooh…Ooh

---

## SOLOISTS:
Let every man consider his last day
When youthful pleasures have faded away
Can he look at his life without pain?

---


Let every child remember how to pray
For the lost of the Earth to find the way
And the Kingdom of Heaven reign.

---

## CHORUS:
Live where you can
Be happy as you can
Ooo
Happier than God has made your father
Live where you can
Be happy as you can
For he may not be here tomorrow
Ooo

---

## SOLOISTS:
O Father let the singer sing for thee
Let word and song and harmony
Be mightier than the sword
O vision holy vision come to me
Let word and song and harmony
Be a sound like the voice of the Lord

---

## CHORUS:
Live where you can
Be happy as you can
Ooo
Happier than God has made your father
Live where you can
Be happy as you can
For he may not be here tomorrow
Ooo
Don’t go…away…O Father…won’t you stay?

---


Ooo. Ooo. Ooo. Ooo. Ooo. Ooo.

---

## EVANGELIST:
Men and Women of Thebes: look upon Oedipus.

---


This is the king who solved the famous riddle
And towered up, most powerful of men.

---


No mortal eyes but looked on him with envy,
Yet in the end ruin swept over him.

---


Let every man in mankind’s frailty
Consider his last day; and let none
Presume on his good fortune until he find
Life, at his death, a memory without pain. Amen.

---

## SOLOISTS:
So don’t go…

---

## OEDIPUS:
Daughter! Sister!

---

## THESEUS:
Alas for the seed of men.

---


What measure shall we give these generations
That breath on the void and are void
And exist and do not exist?

---


Majestic Oedipus!

---


O naked brow of wrath and tears,
O change of Oedipus!

---


I who saw your days call no man blest —
Your great days — like ghosts are gone.

---


[True King, giver of laws,
Majestic Oedipus!

---


No prince in Thebes had ever known such renown
No prince won such grace of power.

---


And now] Of all men ever known
Most pitiful is this man’s story:
[His fortunes are most changes, his state Fallen.]
All eyes fail before time’s eye,
All actions come to justice there.

---


Though never willed, though far down
The deep past, your bed, your dread sirings,
Are brought to book at last.

---


Child by Laius doomed to die,
Then doomed to lose that fortunate little death —
Would God you never took breath in this air that
With my wailing lips I take to cry:
For I weep the world’s outcast.

---


I was blind! And now I can tell why:
Asleep! For he had given ease of breath
To Thebes, while the false years went by.

---

## OEDIPUS:
Daughter!

---

## THESEUS:
He speaks, saying:
“Daughter! Daughter of a bling old man…”

---

## OEDIPUS:
Where have we come to…

---

## THESEUS:
“Where have we come to now, Antigone?”

---

## OEDIPUS:
Who will be kind to me?

---

## THESEUS:
Who will be kind to Oedipus this evening?

---


And give alms…

---

## OEDIPUS:
Who will give alms?

---

## THESEUS:
“Who will give alms to the wanderer?”
Though he ask little and receive still less!

---

## OEDIPUS:
That’s all right.

---

## THESEUS:
It is sufficient.

---


“Suffering and time,” he says, suffering and time,
Vast time, have been his teachers in contentment.

---


“But now, child…”

---

## OEDIPUS:
Now, child.

---


If you can find a resting place…

---

## THESEUS:
“Child.

---


If you can find a resting place…”

---

## ANTIGONE:
I see a man now, not far away.

---


Father you must ask what place this is.

---

## OEDIPUS:
Friend…

---

## THESEUS:
“Friend, my daughter’s eyes serve for my own.

---


She tells me we are fortunate enough to meet you.”

---

## OEDIPUS:
Can you tell me, what ground is this?

---


What God is honored here?

---

## THESEUS:
“What ground is this?

---


What God is honored here?”

---

## THE FRIEND:
[It must not be touched.

---


Most dreadful are its divinities, most feared,
Daughters of darkness. Spirits. Furies.

---


The people here prefer to address them as Gentle All-Seeing ones.

---

## OEDIPUS:
Then may they be gentle to the suppliant.

---


For I shall never leave this resting place.]

---

## THE FRIEND:
Fair Colonus
Land of running horses
Where leaves and berries throng
And wine-dark ivy climbs the bough
The sweet sojourning nightingale
Murmurs all night long
Here with drops of Heaven’s dew
At daybreak all the year
The clusters of narcissus bloom
Time-hallowed garlands for the brows
Of those great ladies whom we fear
Fair Colonus
Land of the running horses
Where leaves and berries throng
And wine-dark ivy climbs the bough
The sweet sojourning nightingale
Murmurs all night long

---

## OEDIPUS:
Fair Colonus…

---

## THESEUS:
“Fair Colonus…”

---

## OEDIPUS:
[And who is he whose word has power here?

---

## THE FRIEND:
This land is governed by King Theseus

---

## OEDIPUS:
Tell him a small favor will gain him much.

---

## THE FRIEND:
What service can a blind man render him?

---

## OEDIPUS:
All I shall say will be clear-sighted indeed.]

---

## OEDIPUS:
It was ordained. I recognize it now.

---


I shall never leave this resting place.

---


Daughter, lead me on.

---


Lead me on.

---

## CHORAGOS:
Stop! Do not go on
This place is holy
Ooo ooo ooo
Stop! Do not go on
You cannot walk this ground
Stop! Ooo ooo ooo
Do not go on
Do not go on
Daughters of darkness bar the way
Saying, “Stop!

---


Ooo ooo ooo
Do not go on
Do not go on
Stop! Do not go on
This place is holy
Ooo ooo ooo
Stop! Do not go on
First you must kneel down and pray
Stop! Do not go on
Till the Gods answer “Yes, yes you may!”
Saying, “Stop!

---


Ooo ooo ooo
Do not go on
Do not go on.

---

## OEDIPUS:
Here I stand a wanderer
On life’s journey
At the close of the day
So hungry and so tired
Beaten by the rain
Oh
Won’t you give me shelter
All I need is a resting place
Promised so long (promised so long) ago

---

## CHORAGOS CHORUS:
Stop! Do not go on
This place is holy
Ooo ooo ooo
Stop! Do not go on
You cannot walk this ground
Stop! Do not go on
Til the Gods answer yes, yes you may
Saying, “Stop!

---


Do not go on
Do not go on.”
  AD LIB: Don’t go on

---

## CHORAGOS:
Oh…?

---


Who is this man?

---


What is his name?

---


Where does he come from?

---

## EVANGELIST:
And when he heard that, he was afraid,
Ang he turned to his daughter and said:

---

## OEDIPUS:
“God in Heaven help me, what will become of me now, child?”

---

## EVANGELIST:
And he said:

---

## ANTIGONE:
“Tell them, Father, you cannot hide.”

---

## CHORAGOS:
Who is this man?

---


What is his name?

---


Where does he come from?

---


What is his race?

---


Who was his father?

---


Who was his father?

---

## EVANGELIST:
And he answered, saying:

---

## OEDIPUS:
“My father was Laius of the race Labdacidae.

---


Do not ask my name, my star was unspeakable.

---

## CHORAGOS:
You oughta speak. Speak right now!

---


Speak now! Speak!

---

## OEDIPUS:
I am the accursed. I am Oedipus.

---

## EVANGELIST:
And while he suffers, there comes a woman
Riding a pony and wearing a [wide hat/gold veil]… crying…
“How Shall I See You Through My Tears?”

---

## CHORUS:
FATHER! SISTER

---

## EVANGELIST:
She is Ismene.

---


Princess of Thebes,
Sister and daughter to the accursed.

---

## ANTIGONE:
Sister to me.

---

## ISMENE ANTIGONE:
Father, Sister, dearest voices,
I have found you and I don’t know how
Father, Sister – I hear your voices
But am I dreaming? Or are you here right now?

---


Won’t you tell me
CHORUS AD LIB ISMENE and ANTIGONE
How shall I see you through  Please tell me
my tears?

---


How shall I see you through  I want to know how
my tears?

---


How shall I see you though
my tears?

---

## ISMENE:
Father, Sister, the Gods have spoken
I bring a promise, a holy vow
A world that cast you down forgives you
And those who blamed you sing your praises now
Won’t you tell me
CHORUS AD LIB ISMENE and ANTIGONE
How shall I see you through
my tears? Please tell me
How shall I see you
through my tears? I need to know
How shall I see you through
my tears? Yeah
Destiny brings you back to
me

Child, I’m so glad you’re here”
There’s hope for me, there’s a prophecy

Child I’m so glad you’re here
There’s hope for me, there’s a prophecy

## ISMENE ANTIGONE:
A world that cast you out
They forgive you now
CHORUS AD LIB ISMENE and ANTIGONE
Destiny brings you back to  Hey, hey
me

---

## OEDIPUS:
I’ve been waiting for a sign
To ease my troubled mind
Oooh

---

## EVANGELIST:
[Why have you come, child?

---


What news from Thebes did you bring your father?

---


Where are your brothers?]

---

## EVANGELIST ISMENE:
She tells of his sons Polyneices and Eteocles.

---


[First it was their desire that the throne
Should pass to Lord Creon; that thus the city of Thebes
Should be defiled no longer by their/our family’s ancient curse.

---


But then the sons] Began to itch for power, how they fought
Till Eteocles, the younger son, threw the elder out,
And took the throne. How Polyneices then went to Argos,
Committed treason for an army; sold out his city [of Thebes]
For the promise of his father’s throne.

---


How he marches on Thebes now.

---


Brother, the traitor, marches on brother, the usurper now,
And, trembling at his coming, Thebes calls for you.

---

## OEDIPUS:
For me?

---

## EVANGELIST ISMENE:
Thebes call for you to be a shield against your son
[The oracles declare their strength in you.

---


The proof of it is that Creon is coming for you
For that same reason.

---

## OEDIPUS:
Will my soul rest satisfied?

---


Will Thebes bury me in Theban ground?

---

## ANTIGONE:
Ah, Father!

---

## EVANGELIST:
No, your father’s blood forbids it.

---

## OEDIPUS:
They will never hold me!

---


Gods! May their fires of ambition never be quenched.

---


Let the last word be mine on this battle.

---


Let them that would be the kings of Thebes before sons of Oedipus —
Let them kill each other!

---


CHORUS  AD LIB ISMENE and ANTIGONE
How shall I see you through
my tears? Please tell me
How shall I see you
though my tears? I need to know
How shall I see you
though my tears?Thru my tears

---

## ISMENE:
Well, I’m crying tears of sadness
Father, won’t you turn them into tears of gladness?

---

## CHORUS:
Through my tears, through my tears
Tears…
Tears…
Tears…

---

## EVANGELIST:
It will be bitter for them when they stand
Where you are buried and feel your anger there.

---

## OEDIPUS:
[So let Creon be sent to find me. Creon
Or any other of influence in the state.

---


If you here consent – as do the powers
Holy and awful, the spirits of this place —
To give me refuge. Then shall Colonus have
A great savior; and woe to mine enemies.]

---

## ANTIGONE:
But for now, Father, pray to the Gods whose ground
You violated here. Ask their forgiveness.

---

## OEDIPUS:
What shall I do?

---

## ANTIGONE:
You must first bring libations from the spring that runs forever.

---

## OEDIPUS:
And when I have the holy water?

---

## ANTIGONE:
Take this bowl. Put chaplets round the rim.

---

## OEDIPUS:
Of myrtle springs, or wool?

---

## ANTIGONE:
Of fleece cropped from a young lamb.]

---

## OEDIPUS:
How shall I perform this rite?

---

## ANTIGONE:
You must face the quarter of the morning light
And pour out your libation.

---

## OEDIPUS:
From this bowl?

---

## ANTIGONE:
In one clear stream. Empty and fill it again”
With water and honey. But without wine.

---

## OEDIPUS:
And when this earth receives it?

---

## ANTIGONE:
Cover the place with olive… And then pray, Father, saying:
“Daughters. Spirits.

---


Be gentle of heart
Accept with gentleness
The suppliant and his wish.”

---

## OEDIPUS:
“Daughters. Spirits.

---


Be gentle of heart.

---


Accept with gentleness
The suppliant and his wish.”

---

## CHORAGOS:
What evil things have slept since long ago?

---

## OEDIPUS:
Do not open my old wound and my shame.

---

## CHORAGOS:
It is told everywhere and never dies.

---

## OEDIPUS:
Thebes married me to evil,
Fate and I were joined there.

---

## CHORAGOS:
It was your mother
With whom the thing was done?

---

## OEDIPUS:
Yes: and those two girls of mine
Were given birth by her who gave birth to me.

---

## CHORAGOS:
Then they are your daughters; they are also…

---

## OEDIPUS:
Sisters. Yes… their father’s sisters.

---

## CHORAGOS:
Ah… Pity. Pity yeah! Pity yeah! Pity. You suffered –

---

## OEDIPUS:
Yes…

---

## CHORAGOS:
And Colonus, he sinned.

---

## OEDIPUS:
No!

---

## CHORAGOS:
You killed…

---

## OEDIPUS:
No!

---

## CHORAGOS:
You killed your father!

---

## OEDIPUS:
God in Heaven!

---

## CHORAGOS:
You killed him!

---

## OEDIPUS THESEUS:
“No! I shall not be judged so.

---


In me, myself, you could not find such evil
As would have made me sin against my own.

---


Perhaps our ancestors angered God long ago.”
He said, “If there were prophecies
Repeated by the oracles of the gods
That the father’s death would come from his own son,
How could you justly blame it upon me?

---


On me, who was yet unborn, yet unconceived?

---


He wished to murder me, I did not know him.

---


Before the law – before God – I am innocent.”

---

## THESEUS:
Antigone pleads with the people of Colonus.

---

## ANTIGONE:
Reverent men! Blessed women!

---


Since you will not suffer my father,
Old man that he is,
Take pity on me and let me intercede.

---


Not with lost eyes, but looking in your eyes
As if I were a child of yours,
I beg mercy for him, a beaten man!

---


Hear me!

---


We are thrown upon your mercy as on God’s;
Be kinder than you seem!

---


Gods, I pray you! Be compassionate!

---


For you will never see in all the world
A man whom God has let escape his destiny!

---




---

## OEDIPUS AD LIB CHORUS:
A voice foretold
Where I shall die
Where my soul shall rest Where my soul shall rest
And my body lie
Where pain unending
Ends for me Ends for me
Where I shall find
Sanctuary Sanctuary
A voice foretold
That at my grave
Down my God shall come Down my God shall come
My soul he surely will save
And I shall be
Endowed with grace Endowed with grace
And I shall find
My resting place

---

## CHORUS:
Hear me
Hear me
Hear me

---

## OEDIPUS:
O Lord, hear my prayer

---

## CHORUS:
Hear me

---

## OEDIPUS:
O Lord, hear my prayer
Ladies whose eyes are terrible:
Spirits: upon your sacred ground
I have first bent my knees in this new land;
Therefore, you be mindful of me and of Apollo,
For when he gave me oracles of evil,
He also spoke of this: a resting place,
That after long years in the last country,
Where I should find a home among the powers of justice:
That I might round out there my bitter life.

---


Conferring benefits on those who received me,
And a curse on those who have driven me away.

---


Portents, he said, would make me sure of this:
Earthquakes, thunder, or God’s smiling lightening;
But I am sure of it now, sure that you guided me
And led me here into your hallowed wood.

---


How otherwise could I have found this chair of stone?

---


Grant me then, Goddesses, passage from life at last,
And consummation, as the unearthly voice foretold;
Unless indeed I seem not worthy of your grace —
Bound as I am to such ending pain
As no man had before.

---


O hear my prayer,
Sweet children of original Darkness hear me,
Pity a poor man’s carcass and his ghost,
For Oedipus is not the strength he was.

---


Therefore, in the name of God, give me shelter!

---


Give me sanctuary! Through my face
Be dreadful in its look, yet honor me!

---


For I come as one endowed with grace
By those who are over Nature; and I bring
Advantage. I bring advantage.

---


I bring advantage to this place.

---


Where pain unending
Ends for me
And I shall find
Oh let me find
Please let me find
I got to find
Hey
Sanctuary

---

## ANTIGONE:
Father, Theseus has come.

---

## THESEUS:
In the old time I often heard men tell
Of the bloody extinction of his eyes.

---


Even if on my way I were not informed,
I’d recognize him, son of Laius. I am sorry for him.

---


I too was an exile. Therefore
No wanderer shall come to me,
As she has done and be denied.

---


[ALTERNATIVE
In the old time I often heard men tell
Of the bloody extinction of your eyes.

---


Even if on my way I were not informed,
I’d recognize you, son of Laius.

---


The garments and the tortured face
Make plain your identity. I am sorry for you.

---


And I should like to know what favor here
You hope for from the city and from me:
Both you and your unfortunate companion.

---


Tell me. It would be something dire indeed
To make me leave you comfortless; for I
To was an exile. I grew up abroad,
And in strange lands I fought as few men have
With danger and with death.

---


Therefore, no wanderer shall come, as you do
And be denied my audience or aid.

---


I know I am only a man; I have no more
To hope for in the end than you have.]

---

## THESEUS:
He has asked for grace!

---


And offers no small favor in return.

---


As I value this, I shall not, I cannot,
I will not refuse this man’s desire.

---

## THESEUS and CHORUS:
We will never
We will never
No no never
No never
Drive you away
We will never drive you away
From peace in this land
Oh no

---

## CHORAGOS and CHORUS:
We will never
We will never

We will never drive you away
From peace in this land
Oh no
We will never
We will never
No no never
No never
Drive you away
We will never drive you away
From peace in this land
Oh no

---

## OEDIPUS:
I stood a wanderer
On life’s journey
At the close of the day
Hungry and tired
I was beaten by the rain
Why don’t you give me shelter
All I need is a resting place
Promised so long
Promised so long
Promised so long ago

---

## CHORAGOS and CHORUS:
We will never
No no never
Drive you away
We will never drive you away
From peace in this land
No never, no no never
No never, no no never
No never, no no never
No never, no no never
We will never drive you away
From peace in this land

## OEDIPUS:
I am happy here. There is peace here.

---


There is contentment here.

---


I want everybody to know —
I feel good.

---


REPRISE
No never, no no never
No never, no no never
No never, no no never
No never, no no never
We will never drive you away
We will never drive you away
We will never drive you away
From peace in this land…

---

## CREON:
Greetings! Citizens of this land, I bring your greetings!

---


I can see my arrival
Has been a cause of considerable fear to you.

---


Don’t’ be afraid and don’t be hostile!

---


I am an old man; I don’t want hostilities.

---

## THESEUS:
Four eleven,  in your text –
Creon, King of Thebes, comes to Colonus.

---

## CREON:
I come for this man here.

---


Yes, I am sent to bring him [to the land of Thebes.

---


It was ordered by the whole Theban people.]
I am the emissary because it fell to me
As his relative.

---


Poor Oedipus. Come home.

---


Your people summon you.

---


Your people [are right to] summon you.

---


Come home.

---


I grieve for your unhappiness, [old man].

---


I see you ravaged. A stranger everywhere,
Never at rest, leading a beggar’s life,
With only a girl to help you.

---



Does this not shame our people?

---


In the name of your father’s Gods,
Bury the whole thing now; agree
To go back to your city and your home!

---


Come on back home.

---

## THESEUS:
And Oedipus answered Creon thusly:

---

## OEDIPUS:
When I was sick with my own life’s evil
When I would –

---

## CHORUS:
— gladly have left this earth
you had no mind

---

## OEDIPUS:
You had no mind to –

---

## CHORUS:
— give me what I wanted!

---

## OEDIPUS:
But when at last I had my full
Of rage and grief, and in my –

---

## CHORUS:
— quiet house.

---


I’d made my peace
That was the time

---

## OEDIPUS:
That was the time
You chose to –

---

## CHORUS:
— rout me out.

---

## THESEUS:
He said, “Suppose you beg for something
And no man will grant it or even sympathize.

---


But later when you were glutted with all your heart’s desire…”

---

## CHORUS:
All my –

---

## OEDIPUS:
Heart’s desire!

---

## THESEUS:
“When charity’s no charity at all?

---


Then he gives it to you.”

---

## OEDIPUS:
You see this city and all its people
Being kind to me, so you would
Take me away!

---

## CHORUS:
Evil kindness!

---

## OEDIPUS:
Evil kindness!

---


That’s the kind of kindness you –

---

## CHORUS:
— offer me!

---


You’d take him away
But you would not take him home
You’d take him away
To a prison outside the walls

---

## OEDIPUS:
You’d take me away
To a prison outside the walls
You’d take me away
To a prison outside the walls
You think that way the city of Thebes may escape my curse
You think you’ll get reprieved from punishment!

---


No!

---


No! You’ll not get reprieved! What you’ll get is
All my vengeance rampant in that land forever!

---


And what my sons will get of my old kingdom
Is just so much room as they need to die in!

---


Just the room they need to die in!

---

## CHORUS:
You’d take him away
But you would not take him home
You’d take him away
To a prison outside the walls – You!

---


You’d take him away
But you would not take him home
You’d take him away
To a prison outside the walls – You!

---

## CREON:
Oedipus!

---


Time brings you no wisdom!

---


While you were ranting
I have seized your daughters.

---

## OEDIPUS:
You have my children?

---


God help me now.

---

## THESEUS:
God help him now. For don’t you see
In taking his children, Creon [has effectively
Taken his eyes,] rendered [ing] him helpless,
As if “standing in the wind of death.”
Ode 1, strophe 2, line 6:
As if “standing in the late wind of death”
Oedipus attempts to go after Creon
And he cries out to him…

---

## OEDIPUS:
Creon! Creon!

---


You who have taken them
Who have served my naked eyepits as eyes
On you and yours forever
May God, watcher of all the world
Confer
On you such days I have had
My God!

---


My God!

---


My God!

My God!

And such an age
And such an age
And such an age
And such an age as mine.

“Numberless Are The World’s Wonders:

---

## THESEUS, OEDIPUS, CHORUS:
Numberless are the world’s wonders
But none more wonderful than man
The storm-gray sea yields to his prows
Huge crests bear him high
Earth, holy and inexhaustible,
Is graven with shining furrows where his
Plows have gone
Numberless are the world’s wonders
But none more wonderful than man
Words and thought rapid as air
He fashions for his use
And his the skill that deflects
The arrows of snow
The spears of winter rain
From every wind he has made himself secure
From every wind he has made himself secure
From all but one… all but one
In the late wind of death he
He cannot stand.

---

## THESEUS:
Stay here and rest assured. I will not draw breath
Until I have put your children in your hands again.

---

## OEDIPUS:
I wish the wind would lift me
I wish the wind would lift me
Like a dove
Like a dove
I wish the wind would lift me
So I could look with the eyes of angels
For the child that I love

---

## OEDIPUS and CHORUS:
I wish the Lord would hide me
I wish the Lord would hide me
In a cloud
In a cloud
I wish the Lord would hide me
I’d fall like a rain of fire
And I’d lie, lie, lie, lie…
Like a shroud
Lift me up
Lift me up
Like a dove –
Lift me up
Like a dove –

---

## POLYNEICES:
Father!

---

## THESEUS:
Polyneices, eldest son of Oedipus, comes to Colonus.

---


Fortunate is the man who has never tasted God’s vengeance!

---


Where once the anger of Heaven has struck,
That house is shaken forever:
Damnation rises behind each child like a black wave cresting.

---

## THESEUS:
He sees his father – an old man
He’s just an outcast in a strange land
He says:

---

## POLYNEICES:
I have been evil!

---

## THESEUS:
Evil – everybody’s talking about me.

---

## POLYNEICES:
I don’t support my father.

---

## THESEUS:
Son didn’t stand by his father.

---

## POLYNEICES:
In his hour of need.

---

## THESEUS:
In his hour of need.

---

## POLYNEICES:
Father, shall I weep first for my own misfortunes or for yours?

---


Father, God himself seats mercy by his throne.

---


So may mercy restrain you now as well.

---


Wrongs, wrongs can still be healed.

---


Speak to me!

---


Why are you silent?

---

## THESEUS:
(Vamps):
‘Cause you’re evil! You’re so evil!

---

## ANTIGONE:
Father, I wish some God would give you eyes to see.

---


We have been brought back to you.

---

## OEDIPUS:
My children, where are you? Come quickly to my hands.

---


They are your brother’s – hands that have brought
Your father’s once clear eyes to this way of seeing.

---

## POLYNEICES:
Antigone, Ismene, my sisters. Make him reply.

---


I come on a pilgrimage.

---

## EVANGELIST POLYNEICES:
He sees his sisters
Running to their father’s side
He says, “Talk to him.  Talk to him.

---


Can’t you make him reply?”  Can’t you make him reply?

---


He says, “Sisters,  Sisters,
Wond you take my part?”  Won’t you take my part?

---


And they say, they say

---

## ANTIGONE ISMENE:
Brother…

---

## ANTIGONE EVANGELIST:
You yourself must touch his heart. Be rooted in your father’s arms and rest.

---

## OEDIPUS:
Ah my dears, be rooted in your father’s arms, and rest.

---

## POLYNEICES:
I will speak out then!

---


Father. I will tell you why I came.

---


I am a fugitive, driven from my country
Because as the eldest son broth I thought fit
To take my seat upon your sovereign throne.

---


And for this my younger brother banished me.

---


Of this I believe the Furies that pursue him
Were indeed the cause – or so I hear
From clairvoyants whom I afterwards consulted.

---


Then why, why should I come here now?

---

## THESEUS EVANGELIST:
He’s so slick.

---

## POLYNEICES:
Father! These same oracles...

---


They say that those you bless
And only those that you bless… shall come to power.

---


My prayers and those of all who fight with me
Must then be made to you. Great captains follow me.

---

## CHORUS:
Stand… stand by me
Stand… stand by me
Stand… stand by me

---

## POLYNEICES:
No in the name of these brave men and for your own soul’s sake,
We your children all implore and beg you
To give up your heavy wrath against me!

---


Listen to me
We are beggars, are we not?

---


Both of us are exiles, he and I.

---


We live by paying court to other men,
And the same fate follows us.

---


But as for my brother, he lords it in our house,
Luxuriates there, and he laughs, he laughs at both of us, Father.

---


I go forth to punish him who robbed me of my kingdom.

---


If you will stand by me in my resolve,
I’ll waste no time or trouble whipping him.

---


And then I will re-establish you in our house,
And settle there myself, and throw him out.

---


If your will is the same as mine,
It is possible to promise this.

---


If not, I will die.

---

## OEDIPUS:
LIAR!

---


Once you held the power
And when you did you drove me out
Made me a homeless man
You are no son of mine
You are no son of mine

---

## CHORUS:
O you break my heart
You break my heart
O you break my heart
Don’t do it – don’t do it

---

## THESEUS:
Weeping is no good now! For we have placed
A curse on you that we now invoke!

---

## OEDIPUS THESEUS:
You shall never see your native land again
You shall never see your native land again.

---


You will go down all bloody and your brother too.

---


Yes, you shall die by your own brother’s hand.

---


And you shall kill the man who banished you.

---


For this I pray and cry out to the
Hated underworld that it may take you home.

---

## POLYNEICES:
Father!

---

## OEDIPUS THESEUS:
Wretched son! We cry out to the hated underworld
That it may take you home!

---

## POLYNEICES:
Father! Father! Father!

---

## EVANGELIST, ANTIGONE, ISMENE:
Love, unconquerable waster of men
Surely you swerve upon ruin here.

---


You have made bright and anger strike
Between father and son.

---


Even immortals cannot escape you;
And mortal man, in his one day’s dusk,
Trembles before your glory.

---

## ISMENE:
Trembles.

---

## THESEUS:
Though he has watched a decent age pass by,
A man will sometimes still desire the world.

---


I swear I see no wisdom in that man.

---


The endless hours pile up a drift of pain
More unrelieved each day; and as for pleasure,
When he is sunken in excessive age.

---

## OEDIPUS:
Well, that means, he’s gotten to be an old man.

---

## THESEUS:
You will not see his pleasure anywhere.

---


The last attendant is the same for all-
Old men and young alike, there being then
No music and no dance. Death is the finish.

---


No to be born surpasses all philosophy.

---


The second best is to have seen the light
And then to go back quickly from whence we came.

---


The feathery follies of his youth once over,
What trouble is beyond the rage of man?

---


What heavy burden will he not endure?

---


Jealousy, faction, quarrelling, and battle,
The bloodiness of war, the grief of war.

---


And in the end he comes to strengthless age:
Abhorred by all men, unfriended,
Without company, in that uttermost twilight
Where he must live with every, every, every bitter thing.

---


This is the truth, my friend,
Not just for you only, a blind and ruined man.

---

## OEDIPUS:
Maybe not for you. But maybe for me.

---


You see, here I am. I’m a blind man. But here I am.

---


I’m a messed-up man. But here I am.

---


I’m a ruined man. Here I am. Here I am.

---


Aaaah!

---

## THESEUS:
You know, I think some shore in the north
Concussive waves make stream
This way and that in the gales of winter.

---


It is like that with me sometimes –
The wild wrack breaking over me,
All the way from my head to my foot, and coming on forever.

---


No from the plunging down of the sun.

---


Now from the sunrise quarter.

---


Now from where the noonday gleams.

---


No from the night and from the north.

---


I hear it this evening, children.

---


I hear it cascading down in the air! I’m talking about
The God-thrown, I’m talking about the gigantic, holy sound!

---


I want you to know that
Terror crawls all the way to the tips of my hair!

---


I want you to know this evening that
My heart shakes!

---


My soul is salvation bound.

---


And where my body will repair, I know that
Great God Almighty’s smiling lightning opens up the ground.

---


Bless his name!

---

## EVANGELIST:
[Theseus, the lord of Athens, addresses Oedipus, the accursed of
Thebes.]

---

## THESEUS:
Oedipus! Heaven’s height has cracked!

---

## OEDIPUS:
Theseus!

---

## THESEUS:
Your hour has come.

---

## OEDIPUS:
This is God’s work! My lord, I longed for you
To come. My soul sinks in the scale.

---

## THESEUS:
I believe you. I have seen you prophecy
Many a thing, none falsely.

---

## OEDIPUS:
I would not die without fulfilling what I promised.

---


I shall disclose to you what is appointed for you
And your city. A thing that age will never wear away.

---


For every nation that lives peaceably,
Another will grow hard and push it’s arrogance,
Put off God and turn into madness. Fear not.

---


God attends to these things slowly; but he attends.

---


You know this; you know all that I teach.

---

## CHORUS and OEDIPUS:
O sunlight of no light
Once you were mine
This is the last my flesh will feel of you
For now I go to shade my ending days
In the dark underworld.

---

## OEDIPUS and CHORUS:
Most cherished friend, you alone This is the last my flesh
may see the place I am to die. Will feel of you

---

## THESEUS and CHORUS:
And he said unto me…  For now

---

## OEDIPUS and CHORUS:
You must never tell it to any man.  I go to shade

---

## THESEUS and CHORUS:
“You must never tell it to any  My ending days
man.”

---

## OEDIPUS and CHORUS:
For these things are mysteries, In the dark underworld
not to be explained.

---

## THESEUS:
“For these things are mysteries.”

---

## OEDIPUS:
You will understand when you alone will come on it.

---


Alone, because I cannot reveal it to anyone,
Not even my children, much as I love them.

---

## THESEUS:
And he could not reveal these mysteries even to his children.

---

## CHORUS and OEDIPUS:
O sunlight of no light
Once you were mine
Now in the shadow of the vale I pray
You warmed my flesh above, now bless my soul
In the cold underworld…

---

## THESEUS:
He told me to keep it secret always.

---


This way God will preserve us from our enemies.

---


And hold us and our city safe forever.

---


We must be mindful of his suffering,
His death and his redemption. And this our land
And all our people will be blessed.

---

## OEDIPUS:
Remember me. Be mindful of my death.

---


And be fortunate in all the time to come.

---

## THESEUS:
Remember him. Be mindful of his death.

---


And be fortunate for all the time to come.

---

## ANTIGONE, ISMENE, CHORUS:
O sunlight of no light
O sunlight of no light

---

## OEDIPUS:
Once you were mine

---

## SOLOISTS:
Let not our friend go down
In grief and weariness
Let some just God spare him
From any more distress

---

## CHORUS:
O eternal sleep
Child of earth and hell
O eternal sleep
Let him sleep well

---

## SOLOISTS:
We pray to almighty ones
Let his descent be clear
On those dim fields of underground
That all men living fear

---

## CHORUS:
O eternal sleep
Child of earth and hell
O eternal sleep
[Let him sleep well

---

## CHORUS SOLOISTS:
Down, down, down he goes  To a house that has no light
He goes among the ghosts Spirits plunged through the night
Down, down, down below —  He goes among the ghosts
O eternal sleep
Child of earth and hell
O eternal sleep  Sleep on, sleep on, sleep
Let him sleep well
O eternal sleep
Let him sleep well]

---

## EVANGELIST:
[He has gone. It was not war,
Nor the deep sea, that overtook him
But something invisible and strange
Caught him up… or down…
Into a place unseen.

---


Listen, as sisters mourn their brother
And daughters mourn their father.]

---

## ANTIGONE:
O Father! My dear… now you are shrouded
In eternal darkness. Even in that absence
You shall not lack our love.

---

## CHORUS:
Down, down, down he goes
Down, down, down below –

---

## THESEUS:
He lived his life.

---

## ANTIGONE:
In this land among strangers,
He dies where he chose to die.

---


His eternal bed is well shaded.

---


And in his death he is not un-mourned.

---


My eyes are blind with tears.

---


From crying for you, Father.

---


The terror and the loss cannot be quieted.

---


I know you wished to die in a strange country.

---


Yet your death was so lonely!

---


Why could I not be with you? Why?

---

## THESEUS:
That is not permitted. He has no tomb.

---

## ANTIGONE:
Where shall I go? How shall I live?

---


O take me there and kill me too.

---


Great God! What way is left me? What way?

---

## THESEUS:
Mourn no more. Those to whom
The night of earth gives benediction
Should not be mourned. Retribution comes.

---

## ANTIGONE:
Mourn no more. Mourn no more. Those to whom
The night of earth gives benediction
Should not be mourned. Retribution comes.

---

## ISMENE ANTIGONE:
Retribution comes.

---


Retribution comes.

---


Retribution comes.

---


Retribution comes.

---

## THESEUS:
Rejoice, sisters. He has left this world.

---

## SOLOIST:
Well I’m crying hallelujah
Yes I’m crying hallelujah
I was blind, he made me see
Yes I’m crying hallelujah
Lift him up in a blaze of glory
With a choir of voices so heavenly

---

## SOLOIST:

Lift him high high high high high high – higher
Lift him high high high high high high – higher

---

## OEDIPUS:
Lift me up – lift me up

---

## ALL:

With a choir of voices heavenly
REPRISE ALL
Crying hallelujah – crying hallelujah
I was blind! He made me see
Crying hallelujah
Lift him up in a blaze of glory
With a choir of voices heavenly

---

## AUDIENCE MEMBER:
By God’s mercy, was his death a painless one?

---

## KELVIN and MARK:
By God’s mercy, was his death a painless one?

---


Yes, you may wonder, “Was his death a painless one?”
That is the thing that seems so marvelous.

---


You know, for you were witnesses, how he
Left this place with no friend leading him,
Acting, himself, as a guide for all of us.

---


Well, when he came to a steep place in the road,
The embankment there, secured with steps of brass,
He stopped in one of the many branching paths.

---


Halfway between that place of stone,
With its hollow pear tree, and the marble tomb,
He sat down and undid his filthy garments.

---


Then he called to his daughters and commanded
That they should bring him water from a fountain
For bathing and libation to the dead.

---


From there they could see the hillcrest of Demeter,
Freshener of all things. They ascended the hills
And soon came back with water for their father;
They helped him properly to bathe and dress.

---


When everything was completed to his satisfaction,
And no command of his remained undone,
The earth groaned with thunder from God below.

---


And as they heard the sound, the children
Were so afraid, and they began to shudder
And dropped to their fathers knees, and began shuttering,
Beating their breasts and began to weep as if heartbroken.

---


And hearing them cry out so bitterly,
He put his arms around them and said to them:
“My Children, my Children, this day your father is gone from you.

---


All that was mine is gone. You no longer have to
Bear the burden of taking care of me.

---


I know it was hard, my children, and yet one word, one word
Frees us of all the pain and burdens of this life;
That word is love. Love. Never shall you have more
From any man than you have had from me.

---


But now you must spend the rest of your life without me.”
They huddled there together, the three of them and wept.

---


And there was silence, and in the silence suddenly
A voice cried out to him of such a king
It made our hair stand in panic and fear.

---


Again and again the call came from his God:
“Oedipus! Oedipus! Why do you wait?

---


You delay too long; you delay too long to go.”
This much everyone of us heard God say.

---


And after a while as we withdrew,
We turned around – and nowhere saw that man.

---


In what manner Oedipus perished,
No one of mortal men could tell.

---


It was not lightning, bearing its fire,
That took him off. Ah, no hurricane was blowing.

---


But some attendant from the train of Heaven
Came for him; or else the underworld
Opened up with love the unlit door of the earth.

---


For he was taken without lamentation,
Suffering, or pain. Yes —
He was taken without lamentation,
Suffering, or pain. Indeed his end
Was wonderful if mortal’s ever was.

---


Now let the weeping cease.

---


Let no one mourn again.

---


The love of God will bring you peace.

---


There is no end.

---

## SOLOIST:
Now let the weeping cease
Let no one mourn again
The love of God will bring you peace
There is no end

---

## QUARTET:
No let the weeping cease
Let no one mourn again
The love of God will bring you peace
There is no end

---

## FULL COMPANY:
Now let the weeping cease
Let no one mourn again
The love of God will bring you peace
There is no end
Now let the weeping cease
Let no one mourn again
The love of God will bring you peace
There is no end
No end.

---

## KELVIN:
Now let the weeping cease.

---


Let no one mourn again.

---


These things are in the hands of God.
