## AKWASI:
Y’all see all this emptiness?

---

Can you believe it?

---

The theatre finally died!

---

I don’t mean to sound so excited.

---

It’s just, I been waiting her out.

---

Biding my time.

---

For a long-ass minute.

---

‘Cause you don't wanna jump the gun.

---

You don't wanna be throwing flowers on her casket and then the casket opens, Knowhatimsayin’, what’s gonna happen then?

---

…
Well, Theatre Gods willing, I’ma show you.

---

Might get a little hectic.

---

Just letting you know.

---

Typically, when you perform a resurrection, Shit goes down.

---

So I apologize in advance for any and all complications including - but not limited to - ruptures of consciousness, 

---

misrepresentations of history, breaches of etiquette, loud noises, chronic disorientation, et cetera, ad nauseam, 

---

which may occur During our merry stroll through this Valley of Death.

---

Cool?

---

… Oh!

---

And what should I call you?

---

‘Cause I know one thing for certain: I’m not an actor.

---

No.

---

Mm-mm.

---

Not tonight.

---

We gotta do better than that tonight.

---

The problem with death is, it doesn’t come around often enough. 

---

## AKWASI:
Our chance is now.

---

To rename ourselves.

---

Ain’t no tradition we’re bound to follow.

---

Ain’t no precedent we have to meet.

---

Tonight is for the simple questions.
Who am I to you and you to me?

---

Death is Freedom, see?

---

We can go anywhere from here.

---

How ‘bout I call you Fellow Travellers?

---

How ‘bout I call you Searchers of the Universes Seas, And Resting Places of Her Brightest Pearls?

---

How ‘bout I call you My People?

---

Look, my people, I’ma be honest: I don’t have the faintest idea where we’re going.

---

But I will find a way to lead you there. 

---

## ENOCH:
[offstage] A light!?

---

A LIGHT!!??

---

## ENOCH:
A light!

---

Oh, light!

---

Oh solace of my soul!
Light.

---

Light.

---

Light.
Hi.

---

## AKWASI:
Who are you?

---

## ENOCH:
An actor.

---

Who are you?

---

## AKWASI:
Not an actor.

---

## ENOCH:
Oh.

---

I see.

---

I guess I’m the only one left.

---

## AKWASI:
Where did you come from?




---

## ENOCH:
The darkness.

---

## AKWASI:
Oh.

---

## ENOCH:
That darkness over there.

---

## AKWASI:
Right.

---

## ENOCH:
Where’d you find the light?

---

## AKWASI:
I’ve always had it.

---

## ENOCH:
…
Fair enough.
The Bringer of the Light.

---

## AKWASI:
Akwasi, actually.

---

## ENOCH:
Akwasi.
Does it mean Bringer of the Light?

---

## AKWASI:
Nope.

---

## ENOCH:
Oh.

---

Well in any case.
I’m thankful that you brought it.

---


Thankful is not a thankful enough word, in fact.
I never believed this day - or night - is it night?


---

## AKWASI:

…



---

## ENOCH:
I never believed this moment would come.
Dead.

---

My worst nightmares come true.

---

And then you.

---

With your light.

---

I am most honorably and faithfully yours until the end of time.

---

However long that lasts. 

---

## AKWASI:
…



---

## ENOCH:
Things to Remember in Case the Theatre Dies: A List in Several Parts and Several Sub-
Parts, by Me, Enoch, an Actor Through and Through.

---

## AKWASI:
Fold that up, put it away -

---

## ENOCH:
Remembrance number one:
Your name is Enoch, and you are an actor.


---

## AKWASI:
Congratulations.

---

## AKWASI
Put it away.



## ENOCH:
Remembrance number two: You once …
played Romeo.

---

Your favorite line was:
A grave?

---

O no!

---

a lantern,
youth,
For here lies Juliet and her beauty makes
This vault a Feasting Presence, full of light.

---

## AKWASI:
Put it away.

---

Put that crusty,
slaughtered calcified, bullshit the fuck away.
Ignore him, please!
Before I eat it.

---

## ENOCH:
What?

---

## AKWASI:
I’m here tryna make the most out of a unique opportunity.

---

Okay?
I’m here with a clean slate, and you wanna come in and dirty it up with some old words.



---

## AKWASI:
I’m here tryna leave the bullshit behind once and for all, and you wanna stand there holding
too much toilet paper.

---

## ENOCH:
I thought I heard you say you were gonna eat it.

---

## AKWASI:
That too.

---

## ENOCH:
I don’t think I can be honorably and faithfully yours anymore.

---

## AKWASI:
That’s a loss I’m willing to accept.

---

## ENOCH:
Toilet paper.
Interesting.

---

## AKWASI:
What’s interesting?

---

## ENOCH:
Just clarifying -

---

## AKWASI:
Don’t clarify -

---

## ENOCH:
It’s an odd pairing is all I’m saying -

---

## AKWASI:
I can’t worry about what you find odd, if I have shit to say I’ma say it.

---

## ENOCH:
Now see, that makes sense.

---

Shit to say.

---

If we’re talking about toilet paper, that makes sense

---

## AKWASI:
If I need honey and the bee hive is up in a tree, I’ma climb that tree -

---

## ENOCH:
No, see, now we’re lost again -


---

## AKWASI:
Who’s we?

---

## ENOCH:
The people.

---

## AKWASI:
Who appointed you the voice of the people?

---

I’m the motherfuckin’ voice of the people -

---

## ENOCH:
They’re confused -

Are you confused?

This person is confused and it’s dark in here and we need to at the very least give them
something familiar.

---

## AKWASI:
Such as what?

---

## ENOCH:
Well…

---


Just the two of us?
And you’re not an actor.

---

## AKWASI:
I’m the Resurrector.

---

## ENOCH:

Um.

---

## AKWASI:
The Renamer.

---

## ENOCH:

Nope, not finding it.

---

## AKWASI:
The Cleaner of the Slate.


---

## ENOCH:
How about this, we’ll start with the Greeks -


---

## AKWASI:
This is MY STAGE!

---

## ENOCH:
…
Does that mean you have another suggestion?
Something else in the cannon that I’m unaware of?

---

## AKWASI:
Pride and Prejudice.

---

## ENOCH:
Really?

---

## AKWASI:
No.
But let’s take a turn about the room.

---

## ENOCH:
…Like fancy women?

---

## AKWASI:
This will be our fancy lamp, lighting our vast and borderless drawing room.
Won’t you join me?


---

## ENOCH:
Well, this feels nice.

---

## AKWASI:
When in need of inspiration, always take a walk.

---

## ENOCH:
I apologize for picking apart your metaphors just now.


---

## AKWASI:
Accepted.

---

## ENOCH:
You weren’t serious about eating my list, were you?

---

## AKWASI:
I don’t think it would be prudent for me to take the idea completely off the table.

---

## ENOCH:
I love tables.

---

## AKWASI:
Do you?

---

## ENOCH:
Oh, yeah.

---

Always have.
A nice, oaken table?

---

Nothing better.

---

## AKWASI:
Your name.

---

Enoch.

---

What does it mean?

---

## ENOCH:
Dedicated.

---

## AKWASI:
Dedicated.

---

That’s a damn good meaning.

---

## ENOCH:
Thank you.

---



---

## ENOCH:
May I ask why we’re walking in circles?

---

## AKWASI:
Inspiration is a hunter.
We need to make her chase us.

---

## FARAH:
The theatre’s dead.

---

It’s really dead.

---

Does that mean I have to make a speech?

---

Is that expected?

---

Am I supposed to have something to say?

---

… I’m a nomad.

---

It’s a bone marrow thing.

---

Always thinking of the next thing to do.

---

The next place to go.

---

Where the nearest water source is.

---

That keeps you up at night.

---

Wondering which way the river’s going to turn if you follow it off the map.

---

I guess we’re really about to find out, aren’t we?

---

… I think we remember the dead by our deeds.

---

And I think if we do that, they don’t die.

---

I think if we do that, they inhabit us.

---

Not like in a demon way.

---

So, yeah.

---

## FARAH: 
Theatre, if you don’t have a house in heaven, you can come back to earth and live in me.

---

I don’t have an address, But the Porch Light of my Heart is lit for you alone. 

---

## FARAH:
Hi.


---

## AKWASI:
What’s your name?

---

## FARAH:
Farah.

---

## ENOCH:
What does it mean?

---

## FARAH:
Traveller.

---

And joyful.

---

And lots of things.

---

That’s why I chose it. 

---

## AKWASI:
I’m Akwasi.

---

## FARAH:
What does Akwasi mean ?
Walker out of the darkness?

---

## AKWASI:
No.

---

## FARAH:
Oh.

---

## AKWASI:
This is Enoch.

---

## ENOCH:
“Dedicated”.

---

## FARAH:
I’m  so glad  I don’t have to face this death alone.

---

## ENOCH:
I’ve always liked threes.
Tables and the number three are some of my favorite things.

---

## AKWASI:
The Three Resurrectors.

---

## FARAH:
So.
An invisible toast to our shared Fate?
Or chance.
Or dumb luck.
Or whatever improbable confluence of factors blah blah blah resulted in the three of us
standing here right now.

---

## ENOCH:
Wow.
Deluge of memories.




---

## FARAH:
One time I was so deliriously tired from picking up extra shifts, I waited on an empty table.

---

I smiled really big at the napkins. 

---

## ENOCH:
I studied meteorology.

---

I was set up to be a weatherman,
But I couldn’t bear to hear the rest of the news, and I
became severely depressed.

---

So I became an actor.
It didn’t help.

---

## AKWASI:
When I called myself an actor, you know what I could never get right?
The Curtain Call.

---

## FARAH:
Well, death puts a lot of things in perspective.
Maybe this is your chance to get it right.
It might just be the pretend champa talking, but I really want to make a play with you guys.

---

Like right now.

---

## ENOCH:
Me too!

---

I really, really want to!

---

## FARAH:

With this darkness and all therein as witness, we three vagabonds hereby declare that we
will bring about a play that is truly epic.

---

## ENOCH:
And classic.

---

## AKWASI:
And socially relevant.

---

## FARAH:
And hopeful.

---

## AKWASI:
And funny.

---

## ENOCH:
And well-crafted.

---

## AKWASI:
A play to chronicle human civilization.




---

## ENOCH:
And--

---

## FARAH:
Okay, that’s probably enough.


---

## AKWASI:

These are not earthly spirits, my dear people.

---

Our intoxication comes from you.

---

And our toast should be to you.

---

To your hopes. 

---

## FARAH:
To your fears.

---


## ENOCH:
To your reverence for the past.

---

## AKWASI:
To your bravery for the future.

---

## ENOCH:
Now what do we do?

---

## FARAH:
We’ll probably need more light?

---

## ENOCH:
Costumes.

---

We’ll definitely need costumes.

---

## FARAH:
What about like, a, script?

---

## AKWASI:
Fuck a script.

---

## ENOCH:

I do not share his views.

---

## FARAH:
Yeah we can make it up as we go.

---

As long as we can see where we’re going.



---

## ENOCH:
Okay.

---

Where are we leaping to approximately?

---

## AKWASI:
Cave times.

---

Obviously.

Do y’all connect to that?

---

The sense of danger?

---

The need deep within you to survive?

---

What
we’re about to do - we’re gonna see if we can pinpoint a little something.

---

If we can identify
where we might’ve gotten off track.

---

## ENOCH:
What are the immediate circumstances?

---

Are we hunters?

---

## AKWASI:

Yeah.

---

Hunters.

---

Good.

---

## ENOCH:
Then why are you lying down?

---

## AKWASI:
‘Cause we’re on a break.

---

## FARAH:
Scene One.

---

8,000 or so years ago.

---

## ENOCH:
Can I have a minute to get into character?

---

## FARAH:
Fine, I’ll give a speech.


---

## FARAH:
Oh.
So.
I’m a gatherer.

---

I gather things to eat.

---

Pretty much daily.

---

And if I don't do that, I die.

---

So I'm pretty much moment-to-moment.

---

But once every year, I plan ahead.

---

And that's for the asparagus.

---

Because when the asparagus comes up… there's… .

---

well it's time sensitive.

---

There's a window.

---

So I look for the signs that it's about to ripen.

---

And I make sure I'm there.

---

Ready.

---

And this year, there was a late frost.

---

And the frost just…killed the window.

---

So the thing I was looking forward to all year.

---

Well it went away.

---

Just like that.

---

… Have you ever had fresh asparagus?

---

Like, really, really fresh?

---

… Scene One.

---

8,000 or so years ago.

---

The stars did shine.

---

The moon did glow. 

---

## ENOCH:
That was some good sex we all just had.

---

Huh?

---

## AKWASI:
…

---

## FARAH:
…

---

## ENOCH:
I mean, we don’t have any inhibitions.

---

We just…
Do it.

---

## AKWASI:
…
Sex!

---

?
Ha-ha.
Don’t be ridiculous.

---

We’re siblings.

---

## ENOCH:
Oh yeah.
I must have been having a dream.
Not about you guys.

---

## AKWASI:
What are you up to, sister?

---

## FARAH:
Asparagus.

---

## ENOCH:
Oh.

---

I love asparagus.

---

## FARAH:
I like the way it makes my pee smell.

---

Pungent, yet comforting.

---

## AKWASI:
That is exactly the way I feel about it.

---

## FARAH:
It always comes up this time of year.

---

And it’s always here.
But I don’t see it.
Oh no!
Oh no oh no oh no!




---

## ENOCH:
Don’t cry, sister.

---

It’s okay.

---

## AKWASI:
We’ll help you look for it.

---

## FARAH:
No.
It’s here.
There was an early frost.

---

It’s all dead.

---

I should have come out earlier.

---

I should have known. 

---

## ENOCH:
There now, sister.

---

Don’t beat yourself up over it.
Maybe it’s for the best.

---

## AKWASI:
We understand how you feel.

---

## FARAH:
I feel like I missed my chance.

---

And I’ll never have it again.

---

## ENOCH:
There’s always next year.

---

## FARAH:
Next year is not a sure thing.

---

Remember that time almost everyone in our clan died?

---

Who’s to say when it will happen again? 

---

## ENOCH:
Well, try not to be so pessimistic.

---

Come.

---

Let’s go home.

---

## AKWASI:
Why?

---

## ENOCH:
What we were looking for is not here.

---

So we have to go home.

---

## AKWASI:
Why?




---

## ENOCH:
Because.
That's the taboo of our culture.
Our cave culture.

---

## AKWASI:
Why, brother, should we be slaves to a taboo?

---

## ENOCH:
Perhaps for our protection.

---

What if the asparagus mound is bait.

---

Like the way we killed
this bear.

Remember?

---

We hang around this real estate too long and soon someone will be gnawing on our bones.

---

That's the way of things. 

---

## AKWASI:
Oh.
Well why aren’t we the ones waiting and gnawing on bones?

---

## ENOCH:
I don’t know.

---

Why aren’t we?

---

## FARAH:
If we waited here all the time, we wouldn’t miss the asparagus.

---

We could pick it as soon as
it was ready.

---

## ENOCH:
Better yet: we could monopolize that shit.
Think about it.

---

Everybody loves it.

---

It’s a low supply, high demand product.

---

## AKWASI:
You are wise.

---

## ENOCH:
I say we go back to the clan, convince them to move out here with us.

---

Then we’ll capture
anybody who tries to nab our asparagus.

---

## AKWASI:
That’s a mandatory lifetime of indentured servitude.

---

## ENOCH:
No doubt.

---

## FARAH:
We’d make the men go out and hunt for you.

---

And the women go out and gather for me.

---

## AKWASI:
Hell yeah.

---

That’s what I’m talking about, now we’re livin’!

---

## ENOCH:
We’ll have food without having to run for it.

---

## FARAH:
No more bone spurs!

---

## ENOCH:
And if we have more food, our children will not die nearly as often.

---

If more of our children live, they will have an easier time, because they can help each other
and protect each other.

---

And they will learn to do as we do - but they will improve it.
Their children will have an even easier time.
They won't have to run if a new tribe comes.

---

They’ll go where they please.
And whomever they see, man or beast, will have to submit.

---

They will be like
The snake which grows big enough to eat its prey.

---

## AKWASI:
Alright, let’s make a pact.

---

## ENOCH:
No: an Oath.

---

## AKWASI:
To what?

---

## FARAH:
To a new God.

---

## AKWASI:
Why a new God?

---

We have enough Gods.

---

A new God is not a good idea.

---

## ENOCH:
But we need to find a God that can protect us from all the Gods we might be pissing off.

---

## ENOCH:
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?


---

## AKWASI:
I don't know.

---

## ENOCH:
There.

---

## AKWASI:
Where?

---

## ENOCH:
There.

---

Do you see it?

---

A mouth.

---

## AKWASI:
Yes.

---

Yes, a mouth.

---

And look below, that cluster?

---

## ENOCH:
Uhuh.

---

## AKWASI:
A stomach.

---

## FARAH:
The God of one mouth and one stomach.

---

## AKWASI:
He understands our needs.

---

## ENOCH:
He knows how we feel, every moment.

---

## AKWASI:
Look how he stands alone.

---

The others fear him.

---

They will not approach him.

---

## FARAH:
They will not dare to strike his children.

---

## AKWASI:
Like a mother bird, he chews up our food for us and kisses it straight into our mouths.

---

## ENOCH:
Like a great cat, he stalks his prey.




---

## AKWASI:
He does not demand offerings of his followers.

---

He hunts for himself.

---

## ENOCH:
He does not punish us for what we want.

---

He celebrates our desires.

---

## FARAH:
He trusts us.

---

For we have mouths and stomachs, too.

---

## ENOCH:
He is yet young in the sky,

---


## ALL THREE:
But he shall, erelong, consume it!

---

## FARAH:
…
Yup.
End of scene one.

---


## FARAH:
Oh, perfect!

---

Come help me with these!

---

## ENOCH:

…
…
Scene two will be coming your way shortly.
…
These costumes are something.

---


Have you ever put on an outfit or a uniform and just felt like,
“Yeah, this is it. I can do no wrong in this.”?

---


That’s what happened to us, I think.
Quite a Revelatory experience.

---


Which is strange because I don’t really do religion.
Or do I?

---


You know, I think I do.
This is my religion.



---

## ENOCH:

And this is my scripture.
Well, fragments of it.
And this is my temple.

---


This house of all our sins, nightly swept and mopped.
And I can’t tell you what it means to me
To see it getting bright again

---


You know that passage I was trying to read you earlier:
“Here lies Juliet and her beauty makes
This vault a feasting presence full of light.”

---


I mean, yes, it’s a sad play.

---

But the beauty is that before Romeo dies, he sees life after
death.

---

And then shit just gets really, really tragic.

---

But still.

---

In that moment, it doesn’t have
to.
It really doesn’t have to.

I don’t see death.

---

I see life.
So if this is the end of our road looks like, maybe it doesn’t have to be the end.

---

Maybe we should learn a lesson or two and just… let Friar Laurence’s plan play out.

---


Friar Laurence, in case you don’t recall, is… well he’s the helper.

---


The one who tries to keep the star crossed lovers together.

---


He’s a good man, that friar.

---


Really good.

---


## AKWASI:
What’re these for?

---

## FARAH:
Strip.

---

## ENOCH:
What?

---

## FARAH:
Old costumes go in these.

---


## AKWASI:

Throwing old things away.

---

Now we’re speaking my language.
You’re speaking my language, Farah!

---

## ENOCH:

We’re wearing different costumes in every scene?

---

We’re different characters in every scene
is that what you’re suggesting?

---

I just…

---

## FARAH:

Ooh!

---

This one, wear this one.

---

## AKWASI:
Cool.

---

What is it?

---

## FARAH:
It’s like… peasant garb.

Of some kind.

---

## ENOCH:
Look I feel like I’m just starting to get my footing here.

---

I just started connecting to Kyle,
and now I have to start all over again.

---

## FARAH:
Kyle

---

## ENOCH:
I had to give my character a name.

---

## FARAH:
Kyle the Caveman?

---

## ENOCH:
Kyle doesn’t refer to himself as a “caveman” okay, so no.

---

## AKWASI:
Well, put Kyle in his box, we gotta move on.

---

## ENOCH:

“Character development: A character has a history.

---

A vocabulary.

---

Predispositions.

---

Habits.
Obsessions.

---

Dreams. Demons.

---

Memories.

---

Fears.

---

Aspirations.

---

In short: a life.



---

## ENOCH:
And over the course of the play - assuming said play has any merit - the principal
characters will undergo their own unique transformations.

---

A character must be approached
reverentially.

---

On his or her own terms.--

---


## FARAH:
What are you reading from?

---

## ENOCH:
My emergency list.

---

Of things to remember in case the theatre dies.

---

Which apparently it has.
Because you two have killed it!

---


## FARAH:
Maybe it’s not dead.

---

Maybe it’s just choking.

---

On a huge wad of that.


---

## ENOCH:
Really?

---

It’s choking on respect?

---

It’s choking on preparation?

---

It’s choking on the fact that
I care enough about it, that I’m invested enough in its preservation to take notes?

---

## FARAH:
Get dressed, Enoch!

---

## AKWASI:
You don’t have notes.

---

You have embellishments.

---

## ENOCH:
The truly fashionable are often accused of embellishment -

---

## AKWASI:
No, don’t make my insult into a compliment -

---

## ENOCH:
Just as the truly passionate -



## AKWASI:
You’re an embellisher -
-

## ENOCH:
Are often accused of hyperbole -

---

## AKWASI:
Why embellish -

---

## ENOCH:
I don’t embellish I describe.

---

## AKWASI:
If you put whipped cream on a dog,
The dog just licks itself.

---

## ENOCH:
What?

---

## FARAH:
Scene Two!

---

## ENOCH:
I’m not dressed!

---

## FARAH:
So fucking get dressed, what are you a toddler?

---

## AKWASI:

We fight because we care.

---

Don’t be alarmed.

---

We’ll piece this thing together, we pinky
promise.

---


And we won’t forget that you’re part of the puzzle too.

---


You’re like that last piece of the puzzle that we just can’t believe we lost - and we check
everywhere for it - 

---

and of course, there you were all along.

---

In plain sight.
Thanks for being here all along--

---

## FARAH:
Scene two!

---


…
Isn’t something s’pose to happen?

---

Last time something happened.
…
Scene two?





---

## ENOCH:
Great.

---

It’s dead again.

---

God damn it…I told you you were killing it.


---

## FARAH:
There’s something we’re not doing.

---

## ENOCH:

I don’t see what the problem could be.
An audience is necessary.

---

Check.
At least one actor is necessary.

---

Triple check.
Sorry Akwasi, double check, you’re not an actor.

---

## AKWASI:
Thank you.

---

## ENOCH:
Ah, here we are.

---

“A plot is highly suggested.”
So there’s something maybe worth looking into.


---

## ENOCH:
I hate to belabor this, but:
Kyle.
And Bobby and Mandy.
The theatre was alive when they were alive.

---

And now they’re in the trunk and it’s not
working.

---

So maybe that’s the problem.

---

I mean: what about their story?

---

What happened?



---

## AKWASI:

Kyle,
And Bobby and Mandy…
Lived.

---


And they died.
They passed their shit on to their cave-children.

---


They passed it on again.

---

And through the ages,
A lot of crazy shit happened.
And then…uhm


---

## FARAH:
Scene two.

---

## AKWASI:
Then scene two.

---

## FARAH:
…
Egypt?
…
…
Egypt.

---

Five or six thousand years ago.
Ish.
Intense heat.
Labor in captivity.
And an impossible job to do.





---

## AKWASI:
Pharaoh wants us to do what?

---

## FARAH:
Build.

---

## ENOCH:
My hands!
These hands!

---

## AKWASI:
Build what?

---

## FARAH:
A triangle.

---

## AKWASI:

…Triangle.


---

## FARAH:
One of those triangles with the sides.

---

## AKWASI:
Fuck that I'm not building that.

---

## ENOCH:
I never knew such burning.

---

In all my days.

---

## FARAH:
You're like, twelve.

---

## ENOCH:
I'm not twelve.

---

I'm a man.

---

## FARAH:
Why am I the only one pulling?

---

## AKWASI:
How heavy do you think it is?

---

## FARAH:
What does it matter?

---

## ENOCH:
I once thought I could move mountains.

---

## AKWASI:
Methods.

---

That's what matters.
I mean, how long have we been heaving at this thing?

---

## FARAH:
Apparently not long enough - come help!


---

## ENOCH:
My heart is going to give out if I keep pulling.

---

## FARAH:
Nobody cares about your stupid heart, Enoch.

---

## AKWASI:
I care about Enoch's heart.




---

## FARAH:
And I care about not being stoned to death tonight before dinner.

---

So I'd like to finish the
job.

---


## AKWASI:
We need to infiltrate one of those triangles and reverse engineer that shit, cause this method
is not working.

---

## ENOCH:

It’s not just the pain.

---

It’s the suffering.

---

The suffering.

---

The suffering of living in captivity.

---

## FARAH:
So you want to die.

---

You’re giving up.

---

## ENOCH:
I’m articulating my pain.

---

## FARAH:
But to what end?

---

## ENOCH:
To the end of my Humanity, okay?

---

## AKWASI:
This Pharaoh’s a dick, though.

---

Forreal.
BUILD YOUR OWN DAMN TRIANGLE IF IT MEANS THAT MUCH TO YOU!

---

## ENOCH:
I couldn’t agree more.

---

## AKWASI:
The Egyptians say that we’re better off here.

---

That this is somehow good for us.

---

## ENOCH:
What?

---

It’s good for us because it’s good for them?

---

## AKWASI:
Right?

---

Just ‘cause this is a great civilization doesn’t mean I should love it.

---

## ENOCH:
I don’t just not love it.

---

I hate it.




---

## FARAH:
All this pontificating is hastening our deaths.

---

You realize that, right?

---

## ENOCH:
To be surrounded by opulence and yet barred from it all the while?

---


To labor under threat of dismemberment?

---


To harvest plentiful fields for our masters while our bellies growl?

---


To build them monuments?

---


To honor our oppressors by breaking our own backs like this?

---


They want us to forever walk hunched over, like beasts of burden.

---

No, I miss-spoke.

---

If we
were their beasts they might have to feed us better.
They would not want that.

---

## FARAH:

I’m telling!

---

I’m telling on both of you!

---

## AKWASI:
Tell then.

---

‘Cause you know what?

---

I’m done.

---

I’m done with this.

---

I’m beyond done.

---

## FARAH:
God help us.

---

## AKWASI:
We were better off when we were roaming the fields.

---

Roaming the deserts.

---

Roaming
anywhere.

---

This urban bullshit is a motherfuckin’ trip, dog.

---

## ENOCH:
I know, right?

---

Maybe we had a rough time of it.

---

Maybe we were hungry a lot.
But we were free.

---

Now we’re like that boulder:
Not Going Anywhere.

---

## AKWASI:
Hell no it’s not.

---

‘Cause it’s an impossible task.

---

It’s tactics, E.

---

Look, that’s how you
demoralize a people.

---

You say, hey do this thing.

---

Only that thing ain’t no thing.

---

But see,
they don’t think we know that.

---

## FARAH:
I think it moved.

---

## ENOCH:
No it didn’t.

---

## AKWASI:
Quit playin’.




---

## FARAH:
I felt it move.

---

## ENOCH:
You’re hallucinating.

---

## FARAH:
Well, If I am it’s because I’m fatigued because I’m the only one pulling!

---

## ENOCH:
Maybe you should stop.

---

## FARAH:
They will kill us.

---

## AKWASI:
What’s the use of living?

---

They’ve killed our spirits.

---

## ENOCH:
They can stone me all they like.

---

I’ll be drunk and sleeping.


---

## AKWASI:
And I’ll be wide awake.

---

Resisting.

---

Staring at their souls as they do it.

---

But no more of this.
No more of these impossible games.

---


## FARAH:

God.
God of my weakness and my strength.
God of might and power.
God of my hunger and my thirst.
God of mercy.
Help me move this rock.
If you don’t help me, who will?
God of all our tribes,
Preserve us.

---

Let us survive.

---

We do not wish to perish from the earth.
And if it is your will to free us, I pray you:

---

Do it in a way that we’ll remember.
Give us a lesson never to forget.
Raise us up, even in the shadows of Pharoah’s house.



---

## FARAH:
Help us penetrate his mighty walls.
By your will all things are possible.
And in the meantime - if it’s okay with you - give me some magic spell,
To move this motherfucking stone!

---

## Farah: 
[Grunting, wailing]

---

## ENOCH:
[Sobbing]

---

## FARAH:

End of scene two.

---

## AKWASI:

Nice job.

---

## FARAH:
Thanks.

---

## AKWASI:
You really carried us through that one.

---

## FARAH:
Did I have a choice?




---

## ENOCH:
Why’d you end the scene?

---

## FARAH:
Cause you guys weren’t doing anything.

---

## ENOCH:
I was about to.

---

## FARAH:
Sorry.

---

## AKWASI:
What were you about to do?

---

## ENOCH:
Scream at the horror.

---

## AKWASI:
Oh.

---

## ENOCH:
I had a build -

---

## AKWASI:
A build?


---

## ENOCH:
You just decided the scene was over -

---

## FARAH:
I didn’t decide, I observed -

---

## ENOCH:
There was an emotional build happening -

---

## FARAH:
Sorry if I failed to notice the currents of your inner life -


---

## AKWASI:

If you don’t mind, pretend that last scene ended with Enoch screaming at the horror.

---

There you go, injustice rectified.
You wanna go ahead and do the scream so they know what it sounded like?

---


## ENOCH:
Now!?

---

## AKWASI:
If you want to.

---

## ENOCH:
…
[screams at the horror]

---

## FARAH:
Start over there.

---

## Akwasi:.
Clothes.

---


## AKWASI:

All business, ain’t you?

---

## FARAH:
Call it what you want.

---

## AKWASI:
You don’t look happy.

---

## FARAH:
I could care less what you do or don’t call yourself, The bottom line is we’re in this
together and that means you guys need to act with me.

---

You just talk.

And he just emotes.

You’d better be at places!

---

## AKWASI:
What’s wrong with talking?

---

## FARAH:
Fix your crown.

---

## AKWASI:
…

---

## FARAH:
Everyone can’t stand around and theorize and hypothesize and dream.
Someone has to get shit done.
And you left me hanging.

---

## AKWASI:
Left you hanging where?

---

## FARAH:
Is that how it’s gonna be?

---

## AKWASI:
You’re talking about with the rock?

---

You’re talking about the scene?

---

## FARAH:
I don’t like being left.
I don’t like being left alone.
Scene three.

---

## AKWASI:
Can I confide in you?

---

About something?

---

## FARAH:
No thank you.

---

## AKWASI:
Alright, my people.

---

I’ll confide in you.
I’m lost.

---


I said I’d lead the way and it’s like… the way is leading me.

---


And I’m afraid I’m gonna end up back where I’ve always been.

---


At the end of a play.
Having to perform a curtain call.

---


I have this chronic… sickness, I guess.
I don’t know how to bow.

---


I understand the mechanics.

---

But the heart of it escapes me.
No one ever taught me why.

---


It was just an irresistible law of the stage.

---

Come hell or high water,
Hot air rises,
Light travels at 186,282 miles per second,
And when the show is over, we bowin’.

---


Well: that’s not enough anymore.
I talk a good revolution but still I feel like a blasphemer when I say that.

---


The law is not enough.

---


How am I supposed to mean it?

---

You know what I’m saying?
Because a form deprived of meaning… well that is the saddest story in the world.

---


And I want no part of it.

---

## FARAH:
Scene three.
Atlantis.

---

## ENOCH:

Excuse me, is this supposed to be chronological?
I thought we were performing, like, history -

---

## FARAH:
The legend of Atlantis is part of history.
Scene -

---

## AKWASI:
So we can make it whatever we want to make it.

---

It’s not history.

---

It’s our story.
Ourstory.
Artistry.

---

## FARAH:
The scene is starting.

---

Please do your jobs -

---

## ENOCH:
Sure, if it connects -

---

## AKWASI:
Everything connects.

---

That’s the nature of things.

---

To connect to each other.

---

## ENOCH:
That’s a copout -

---

## FARAH:
Scene three -

---

## AKWASI:
Copout my ass -

---

## ENOCH:
I’m here to tell a story -

---

## AKWASI:
And I’m here to lead us somewhere we’ve never been.

---

## ENOCH:
Weren’t you just complaining about being lost?

---

## AKWASI:
Oh, shit you just blew my mind a little there.

---

## ENOCH:
See?

---

Nobody likes being lost.

---

## ENOCH:
Scene three.

---

## AKWASI:
I’m supposed to be lost!

---

## FARAH:

Atlantis’ highest tower.

---

## AKWASI:
The thunder boomed.

[Thunder booms]

---

## ENOCH:
The rain did shower!

[Rain]

---

[A flash of lighting and a loud crack of thunder.]

---

[Outside, rages a monumental storm.]


---

## AKWASI:
Your robe needs to be mended.

---

## FARAH:
It's fine.

---

## AKWASI:
It's tearing at the seam.

---

## FARAH:
Well.

---

## AKWASI:
It should be fixed.

---

## FARAH:
I prefer it torn.




---

## AKWASI:
We have a kingdom's worth of thread.

---

## FARAH:
I tore it myself.

---

On purpose.

---

## AKWASI:
Oh.

---

## FARAH:
I thought my regalia deserved a scar.

---

## AKWASI:
None of this is your fault, my queen.

---

## FARAH:
I know, my king.

---

## AKWASI:
I blame this shit on FEMA.

---

## FARAH:
…

---

## AKWASI:
Seriously though, where those motherfuckers at?

---

## FARAH:
…

---

## AKWASI:
Silver thread would be best, I think.

---

It would give you a whole different look.

---

As a matter
of fact, we can use this opportunity to redesign your whole wardrobe.

---

## FARAH:
Please do not talk to me about thread or anything else.

---

You betray your people.

---

## AKWASI:
Because I would protect them?

---

## FARAH:
Yes.




---

## AKWASI:
We two are meant to rule as one.

---

## FARAH:
Yes.

---

## AKWASI:
That has been the glory of our nation.

---

Two crowns, one mind.

---

## FARAH:
Yes.

---

## AKWASI:
Then we compromise.

---

We send out one ship.

---

## FARAH:
No.

---

Zero ships.

---

## AKWASI:
This is unconscionable.

---

## FARAH:
Get a new conscience, then.

---

## AKWASI:
And what if I were as fixed in my ways as you?

---

## FARAH:
You are not.

---

## AKWASI:
What if I demanded that we send out all our ships.

---

All our books.

---

What if I demanded that
we be remembered?

---

## FARAH:
Conviction has roots that strength cannot approach, let alone move.

---

I fear nothing and
submit to no one.

---

## AKWASI:
And yet you'll submit our kingdom to the fate of annihilation.

---

## FARAH:
Fate is my dearest friend, King.

---

## AKWASI:
More dear to you than I am.




---

## FARAH:
Yes.

---

## AKWASI:
Well, all's forgiven.

---

We're both under a lot of stress.

---

Look, here comes someone else to talk
to.

---


## AKWASI:
General Enoch.

---

What have you to report?

---

## ENOCH:
The skies are weeping for us.

---

Their grief cannot be calmed.

---

It falls in torrents.

---

## AKWASI:
You're saying it's raining?
That's your report?

---

Do we pay this man for this?
Of course we do!

---

How else would we know it was raining if he did not tell us?

---

## ENOCH:
Okay, I see what you're doing here.

---

You wanna cast me as the “weather man”.

---

Well I
accept that label.

---

And you know what?
On behalf of weather men--and women--past present and future, guess what?

---

We know
that people think we're unnecessary.

---

We know that you can look at the radar yourself.

---

Yeah, that's right.

---

We fuckin' know.

---

We know.

---

CAPITAL K, n, o, w, we know.

---

And guess what?

---

We still have jobs and we always will have jobs, so you can take your engineering
degree, 

---

and your IT degree and your arts degree--don't even get me started on that shit--

---


and you can take your unemployed ass to your apartment, 

---

and while you're waiting for the
eviction notice you can sit in front of your computer and beat off to the weather radar all
you want, 

---

and no one's gonna pay you for it.

---

I'm not a weatherman because I'm the only
one who can read a weather map.

---

I'm the weather man because I'm your connection to the
weather, because rightly or wrongly, 

---

I'm the liaison between the weather and the
community okay, you pompous shit?

---

I am Weather William Wallace, so fuckin' deal with it.
I put in the work, I paid my dues, I'm in the news.

---

And don't pretend that you don't watch
the weather channel for hours when you're alone because the ratings say otherwise.

---

And I can see you through that screen.
Okay.
Moving on.

---

## AKWASI:
You say the skies are weeping, general?




---

## FARAH:
Are there any signs of abatement?

---

## ENOCH:
No, madam.

---

## AKWASI:
Do you have any recommendations for the Royal Mind?

---

## ENOCH:
Yes, your highness.

---

## AKWASI:
Speak freely, General.

---

## ENOCH:
Yes, your highness.
Boats.

---

## FARAH:
Would you care to elaborate?

---

## ENOCH:
Atlantisian sailors are the pride of the world, your highness.

---


I must believe that some of us can…
We all accept our fate and the will of the Gods.

---


But why not leave the earth some of their handiwork?
If we deploy all of our navy a few will survive the storm.

---


I know it.
And those that do may carry the progeny of our arts, our sciences, our philosophy,
Our poetry.

---


Why even if one vessel were to survive intact, it would be the silent teacher of our heritage.

---


Oh, your highness, our vessels.
Our boats that have been called the Sea's Joy.
Those boats that are the labor of our souls.

---


Those boats that are love letters passed from our sires to our sons.

---


And if our sons will sire none, then let the world at least harbor one of their ships.

---


Your highnesses?

---


One ship?

---

## FARAH:
Our ships.

---

The sea's joy.
But the sea is not smiling now.

---

## ENOCH:
No, your highness.




---

## AKWASI:
The Royal Mind is divided, General.

---

This side agrees with you.
Now what say you to this?

---

One ship set out to sea would need all in its favor:
Skill, chance and the Grace of our Gods.

---


Do you have or know of any sailor capable to survive this storm
Without all three of these?

---

## ENOCH:
Without luck, skill and Favor?
Undoubtedly no.

---

## AKWASI:
Then what say you, my better half, to this:
We roll the dice.

---

We pick a ship at random.
We send it out and let the Divine Will
Carry it where it may.

---

If down with the rest of us, so be it.
But if it wash up on some shore
Or spill some memory of us ours upon some rocky bank,
Then thank the Heavens.

---

## FARAH:
What scroll, what tablet, what teaching can you find
Among all our ancient wisdom that would allow such an action?
Friends, this is no mere storm.

---

No game of chance.

---


We must submit to the Divine Will, or to our own.
Should we be servants of angels, or slaves to ourselves?

---


What can we know about the wisdom of our manifest fate?

---


What!
Shall we send a ship to test our Gods when they have already spoken?

---


Even as they now roar?
Shall we be so degenerate as to run, screaming, from our sunset?

---


Have we not been promised, that we shall know no grief?

---


And if ever we needed that faith, is this not the hour?

---


The Goddess of the Ocean needs our treasure.
Our only sadness is that we cannot give her more.

---

## ENOCH:
Your highnesses…Awaiting your official command.

---

## FARAH:
Speak, King.


---

## AKWASI:
General Enoch: Instruct all the officers in your Navy
To sink their vessels; and prepare to receive the tide,
Which shall embark us all to eternal seas.

---

## ENOCH:
Yes your highness.
May I kiss the hand of my queen?

---

## ENOCH:
Might I kneel before my king?

---

## AKWASI:
Nay, embrace him.

---

## AKWASI:
Now swiftly to your men.

---

## FARAH:
Hold me, my king.

---

## FARAH:
…
End of Scene Three.

---

## AKWASI:

Has that ever happened to you?
…
No, I’m serious.
…
Of course it has.




---

## ENOCH:

I feel like we all bonded a little there.

---

## AKWASI:
Of course there’s a lost Atlantis inside you somewhere.
Maybe more than one.

---

## ENOCH:
Like I feel genuinely close to you guys.

---

## AKWASI:
That’s why we’re here, my people.

---

To sing your forgotten fleets back home.

---

## ENOCH:
You know what?

---

I’m gonna write something down.

---

## FARAH:

What’s coming next?
Do I even want to know?

---

## ENOCH:
I’m gonna write a new thing on my list.
I learned something.

---

## FARAH:
Can someone check?

---


## AKWASI:
Stop writing, Enoch.

---

## ENOCH:
Why?

---

## AKWASI:
Who knows where that thing is gonna end up.

---

For all we know some innocent kids a thousand years from now, are gonna come across
that list and all they’ll have is your overwrought interpretation.

---

They won’t understand that
moment.




---

## ENOCH:
They’ll understand it through what it mean to me.

---

Isn’t that enough?

---

I mean what’s the
alternative?

---

## AKWASI:
The alternative is we get ourselves more lost.

---

Further off the trail.

---

## FARAH:
That’s not possible.

---

## ENOCH:
“I once played general Enoch, in a play…” What is this thing even called?

---

## FARAH:
Okay, I’m awake now.

---

I’ll push through.

---

## AKWASI:

Why isn’t it possible?


---

## FARAH:
Because the path is the path.

---

## ENOCH:
“And I played General Enoch… and…”
Well, what should I say?

---

## AKWASI:

What the hell?

---

## ENOCH:
“It happened.”

---

## AKWASI:
Why is shit changing already?

---

## ENOCH:
I’ll think on it.

---

I’ll come up with the right wording.

---

## FARAH:
It’s not for us to say.

---

Is it?
We can try to go anywhere we want, but it doesn’t mean we’re free.

---


Speaking of which, it looks like one of us is going to have to be a slaver.

---

## ENOCH:
How 'bout a sea captain?

---

## FARAH:
Sure.

---

Slave ship captain.

---

## ENOCH:
That's the last thing I would want to be.

---

## FARAH:
Nobody asked you.

---

## AKWASI:
Y’all better not even look at me.

---

Kwasi don’t play slaves

Ooh, this is pretty.

---

## ENOCH:
I do not consent to this.

---

## FARAH:

“A greater power than we can contradict
Hath thwarted our intents.”

---

## ENOCH:
Friar Lawrence.

---

## FARAH:
Go wait for your cue.

---

Please.

---

## FARAH:
Scene four.
Centuries have passed.

---

Tribes have travelled, scattered, battled, merged.

---

Nations have blossomed, withered, been swept away, conquered each other, and spread
their mighty arms.

---


And there’s nothing any of us could have done to change that.

---


The year now is 1792, we’ll say.

---


On the west African coast, we now rejoin our play.

---

## AKWASI:
My people - history ain’t got nothin’ on us.
The beaten path can kiss my ass.

---


Dead-ass theatre wanna bring itself back to life just to tell me what to do?

---


Got another thing comin’.

---

[Colonial music plays]
[Waves crashing]

---

## ENOCH:
'Sup, man?

---

## AKWASI:
Enoch!

---

My man!

---

How’s the ocean treating you?

---

## ENOCH:
Can’t complain.

---

How was the fair?

---

## AKWASI:
What do you know about a fair?

---

## ENOCH:
Nothing at all.

---

## AKWASI:
You know that shit is classified.

---

## ENOCH:
Kwasi, come on, we know about the fair.
I've been to the fair -

---

## AKWASI:
You're bullshitting.

---

## ENOCH:
Last time I docked -

---

## AKWASI:
The shit is creeping down your leg.

---

## ENOCH:
You weren't here, no one was here -

---

## AKWASI:
It's in your boots, now -

---

## ENOCH:
So I went up -

---

## AKWASI:
The shit is in your boots -

---

## ENOCH:
I went up, you know up to the fair.

---

## AKWASI:
…

---

## ENOCH:
…

---

## AKWASI:
Come on.


---

## ENOCH:
Would I lie to you about some shit like that for no reason?

---

## AKWASI:
Give me a landmark.

---

No, in fact, you're an Englishman, you've got our shit all mapped and
bordered, give me coordinates.

---

Give me a longitude and a latitude.

---

## ENOCH:
Maybe I wasn't there there.

---

## AKWASI:
Right.

---

## ENOCH:
Right.

---

But I know about it.

---

So I'm just asking you how was it?

---

How'd you fare at the fair?

---

## AKWASI:
Are you nervous?

---

## ENOCH:
You're tryna change the subject.

---

## AKWASI:
What subject?

---

## ENOCH:
What subject?

---

Are you being serious with me right now?

---

The fair.
…
Come on, I'm not like… what am I gonna do?

---

I don't care.

---

## AKWASI:
As I said, I didn't go.

---

## ENOCH:
You didn't go.

---

## AKWASI:
Nope.

---

## ENOCH:
Oh, okay.

---

You didn't go.
…
And I'm here doing what, then?
Wasting my time?



---

## ENOCH:
This is not how you conduct business.

---

I can dock anywhere I fuckin' want to.

---

I can go
three miles up the coast, set up camp right outside the fairgrounds -

---

## AKWASI:
…
Go for it.

---

See what happens.

---

## ENOCH:
Do you want a tour?

---

Of my ship?

---

## AKWASI:
Why would I want a tour of your demon torture ship?

---

## ENOCH:
No, it'll be nice I'll introduce you to the crew, show you the layout, just, in case you know,

---


things happen, you know, say someone sneaks up behind you with a net or something and
you end up in… 

---

undesirable circumstances, you'll.

---

at least you'll know.

---

What to expect
on the ride over - I'll even give you a sample itinerary - kinda walk you through a typical
day.

---

## AKWASI:
I will no longer sell to you.

---

## ENOCH:
Hey, look it's not personal.

---

Don't take this personally.

---

## AKWASI:
I do take it personally, there's a code.

---

You don't just betray your business partners.

---

## ENOCH:
I'm just -

---

## AKWASI:
You're trying to threaten me, underhandedly.

---

That is bad practice and it betrays ill morals.
There's a saying:
Do not build a house from a fallen tree.

---

For it has already rotted.

---

## ENOCH:
Okay.

---

## AKWASI:
You don't seem to know what I'm saying.

---

## ENOCH:
Sorry if I overstepped my bounds.

---

I would totally set you free if someone tried to sell you
to me.

---

## AKWASI:
I do not believe you anymore.

---

## ENOCH:
Then maybe I don't believe you anymore.

---

After all, I came to trade.

---

And you have seem to
have no goods you're running me around in circles, giving me proverbs about termites--

---

## AKWASI:
Who said I did not have goods?

---

## ENOCH:
You did.

---

## AKWASI:
No no no no no -

---

## ENOCH:
Okay, Kwasi, please.

---

I've got, I can't--I've got a crew waiting, okay, I've got people
developing scurvy, I can't keep talking in circles with you.

---

## AKWASI:
You want to do business in Africa motherfucker, this is how we do it.

---

## ENOCH:
The hell are you doing?

---

## AKWASI:
I'm coming to my point.

---

Point's in the center.

---

## ENOCH:
I'm not about to start following your finger, you realize that, right?

---

## AKWASI:
It doesn't matter, I just want to talk.

---

I'll come to the point if there is one.
Oh.

---

There it went.

---

Sorry.

---

## ENOCH:
Okay.

---

This is really.

---

I'm -

---

## AKWASI:
…
Haaaaaaahahahah!

---

Sorry, sorry.

---

Ohhhh, how many niggas you want I've got several
dozen.

---

## ENOCH:
Where are they?

---

## AKWASI:
I'm not fucking with you I promise.

---

I'm not fucking with you.

---

## ENOCH:
You said you didn't go to the fair.

---

## AKWASI:
The fair is for grazers.

---

I’m a hunter.

---

I run my own operation now.

---

I trade you slaves, you
give me guns.

---

I hire some men, equip them with the guns, we go into the interior, just roll
up on motherfuckers whenever, wherever, broad daylight.

---

It's too easy.

---

And I can better
ensure the quality of the product.

---

## ENOCH:
Oh.

---

Cool.

---

## AKWASI:
My price has gone up considerably.

---

## ENOCH:
Listen, my costs are fixed months in advance -

---

## AKWASI:
Come see the merchandise -

---

## ENOCH:
There's really no point if I can't pay.

---

## AKWASI:
Oh you can pay.

---

That's one thing I learned about making a bargain with the devil.

---

The devil
always has a little more.

---

## ENOCH:
I'm the devil now?

---

That's your bargaining chip?

---

## AKWASI:
It's not a bargaining chip it's a fact.

---

You're the devil.

---

We know what you do to people on
the ships.

---

We've heard.

---

We are not unaware.

---

## ENOCH:
And we know about the fairs.

---

Okay?

---

So don't…I pray to God Almighty every day.

---

And
my ship has made it across the angry seas a dozen times.

---

So how could I be the devil?
How dare you call me the devil?

---

You are the devil.

---

## AKWASI:
Nope.

---

You are.

---

## ENOCH:
The slaves that no one buys?

---

At your markets?

---

What happens to them?

---

Tell me that.

---

## AKWASI:
Depends.

---

## ENOCH:
Are they not instantly beheaded?

---

Be truthful.

---

## AKWASI:
You can't just let the motherfuckers go, what's going to happen, then?

---

We do not torture
them, as you do.

---

We kill them quickly and we move on.

---

Next.

---

Next thing.

---

A rolling stone
gathers no moss.

---

You've heard that one, I know.

---

## ENOCH:
I have a family.

---

## AKWASI:
Yes.

---

## ENOCH:
I believe in God.

---

## FARAH:
CAPTAIN, COME ON LET'S GO WHERE ARE THE SLAVES!?

---

I'M DEVELOPING
SCURVY FROM ALL THIS WAITING!

---

HAVEN’T YOU BOTH PRETTY MUCH
MADE YOUR POINT BY NOW!?

---

## ENOCH:
I'LL BE THERE IN A MINUTE JUST WAIT IN THE BOAT!

---

## FARAH:
I'M SICK OF WAITING IN THE STUPID BOAT!

---

## ENOCH:
I HAVE HAD IT WITH YOUR COMPLAINING!

---

IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT, YOU
CAN STAY HOME NEXT TIME!

---

## FARAH:
I WILL!

---

## ENOCH:
GET BACK IN THE BOAT!

---

## FARAH:
FUCK YOU!!

---

## ENOCH:
I rely on God at every moment.

---

I have to.

---

More so than my pompous countrymen.

---

And
they call me devil as well.

---

## AKWASI:
This I did not know.

---

## ENOCH:
Oh, yes.
Always over coffee.

---

Coffee with sugar.
They savor my sins on their tongues and call me devil through their teeth.

---

## AKWASI:
If it helps, just call it a crime of opportunity.

---

That's what I call it now.

---

Those savages I have
waiting for you?

---

Strong men.

---

Healthy.

---

But they do not have this.

---

## ENOCH:
Yes.

---

An invisible toast to technology.

---

## AKWASI:
Cheers.

---

## AKWASI:
Is that a record of your travels?

---

## ENOCH:
What’s that?

---

## AKWASI:
That in your pocket there.

---

## ENOCH:

Oh, this?

---

It’s…yes.

---

It’s a map.

---

## AKWASI:
Is that right?

---

To where does it lead?

---

## ENOCH:
All over the world.

---

## AKWASI:
May I?

---

## AKWASI:
There.
Now we are both lost.

---

Now we are equals.

---

Now we can trade.
Come.
I’ll show you what I’ve got.

---

## ENOCH:
End of scene four.

---

## ENOCH:
…
You know, I played Romeo.
Romeo.

---

It's a great role.
And I thought I was just getting started.
I figured I'd eventually get a shot at Hamlet.

---

Richard the Third.

---

Mackers.

---

You know the
whole… trajectory.
All the way to Lear.
God, Lear.

---

## ENOCH:
And not just Shakespeare.
But that was gonna keep me fed, you know.

---

That was gonna be my foundation.

---

I was
ready.

---

I was prepared.

---

I was confident.

---

Not just for the roles.

---

But for the life.

---

The life I was
prepared to lead.
And now it's just.
The three of us?
And we don't really seem to see eye to eye.
And for all I know this is the last play I'll ever do.
And I don't like it.
And I don't understand it.
I mean, I memorize roles in advance.

---

Roles that I'd like to play.
But how could I possibly have prepared for this?
So I'm grieving.

---

For all those perfect moments that I'll never have.
And I'm impressed at how you're just okay with this.
But I mean, how can you be?
Whatever this play is supposed to be - there's a pretty good chance we're messing it up.
Like, Royally.

---

And……I don’t know.
How are you okay with this?

---

## FARAH:
I keep telling myself that all our fucked up pictures are hanging on God’s refrigerator.
Right next to the good ones.

---

## ENOCH:
Do you really believe that?

---

## FARAH:
Ultimately, yes.

---

## ENOCH:
Well, I’m happy for you.

---

## AKWASI:
No no.

---

We don't need those.

---

Thank you, we're good.

---

## ENOCH:
We'll take the chairs and table, please and thank you.

---

## AKWASI:
GET IT OUT GET IT OUT GET IT AWAY!

---

## VOICE OVER:
Scene five.

---

The present.

---

An interrogation room in a police station.

---

Akwasi, who is under arrest for drug possession, sits at the table.

---

## AKWASI:
Are you serious, theatre?

---

Hell no and hell no.

## VOICE OVER:
He wears a t-shirt and jeans.

---

## AKWASI:
I’m not doin’ it.

---

I’m not doin’ it theatre!

I’m not doin’ it.

---

## FARAH:
Fine.

---

I’ll be you.

---

## AKWASI:
Be my guest.

---

And you know what…

---

## FARAH:
That’s supposed to be for another scene.

---

## AKWASI:
Well, fuck that scene, I’m wearing it now.

---

## FARAH:
You can’t.

---

## AKWASI:
I am.

---

## AKWASI:
NO!! TABLE!!

---

## AKWASI:
That's right.

---

No table.

---

'Cause I'm Russel Crowe as the Gladiator up in this bitch.

---

That
motherfucker didn't even have to bow.

## VOICE OVER:
Enoch, a lawyer, enters wearing a suit and tie.

---

## AKWASI:
Tell me that wouldn't be gangster as hell!

---

The show ends and we just:

Are you not entertained!?
Are you not entertained!?
Is this not why you are here!?

---

## ENOCH:
Can we just do the scene, please?

---

## AKWASI:
We're waiting on you -

---

## AKWASI:
While you change your shoes for no reason like some wackass Mister Rogers.

---

## ENOCH:
Mister Rogers was a great man.

---

## AKWASI:
Never said he wasn't.

---

## ENOCH:
A great man.

---

## AKWASI:
I'm just saying why are you changing your shoes -

---

## ENOCH:
I was flustered and I put on the house shoes instead of the work shoes -

---

## FARAH:
I don't know who I would be without Mister Rogers.

---

He's possibly the greatest person
who ever lived.

---

## ENOCH:
I don't think it's even debatable.

---

He's the greatest person who ever lived.

---

## AKWASI:
I wasn't insulting Mr.Rogers, I was -

---

## FARAH:
Making a joke in which Mr.Rogers is the punch line means you think Mr.Rogers is
somebody to be laughed at.

---

## AKWASI:
Who's laughing at Mr.Rogers?

---

## ENOCH:
Well I know who's not laughing: the children of the world.

---

For whom Mister Rogers gave
his heart an soul.

---

Every day of his life.

---

## FARAH:
With humility, and grace and class and tenderness.

---

## ENOCH:
I'm honored that you compared me to Mister Rogers.
Thank you.

---

## AKWASI:
You're welcome.

---

Sorry.

---

## VOICE OVER:
Enoch introduces himself to his client, Akwasi.

---

## ENOCH:
Akwasi?

---

## FARAH:
Yeah.

---

## ENOCH:
Hi.

---

I'm Enoch.

---

I'm your lawyer.

---

## AKWASI:
I don't have no lawyer.

---

## FARAH:
I don't have no lawyer.

---

## VOICE OVER:
Enoch and Akwasi sit across from each
other at the table.


---

## ENOCH:
Do you mind if I sit down?

---

## FARAH:
Go for it.

---

## ENOCH:
Thanks.

---

## ENOCH:
Ah.

---

It feels nice to take a load off my feet, even for just a second.

---

Haven't been able to
catch my breath all day.

---

## FARAH:
Yeah, I can't stand this motherfuckin' police station.

---

But that is the one bright spot, though.
The chairs are comfortable.

---

## ENOCH:
Agreed.

---

Now, regarding this “Not having a lawyer” thing: I'm pleased to report to you that -
in case you didn't learn this in school or during your prior arrests - we live in America.
And in the 21st century, no less!

---

So you're very fortunate.

---

Everyone gets a lawyer here!

---

## AKWASI:
Bullshit, I can name you a dozen niggas in the clink right now that ain't never had no
lawyers.

---

## FARAH:
Bullshit, I can name you a dozen in the clink right now that ain't never had no
lawyers.

---

## AKWASI:
And those just the names I know off the top of my head.

---

## FARAH:
And those just the names in my short term memory, bitch!


---

## ENOCH:
I'd love to chat about this issue further, but it really isn't the best use of my time.

---

So here's
what's going on: the prosecutor is offering you a plea deal.

---

You won't have to go to jail.
Probation only.

---

And of course you'll pay a fine and blah blah blah.

---

You need to take that
deal.

---

Any questions?

---

## AKWASI:
Do you want to know who the man standing behind me is?

---

## FARAH:
Do you want to know who the man -

---

## ENOCH:
There is no man standing behind you.

---

## AKWASI:
He's my inevitable future.

---

## FARAH:
I’m going to spend the majority of my life in jail.

---

## ENOCH:
You don’t have to.

---

That’s why you take the deal.

---

Any questions?

---

## AKWASI:
Why you watering that plant?

---

This police station ain’t your office.

---

## FARAH:
What if I'm not guilty?

---

## ENOCH:
As your legal counsel I feel obligated to tell you that you'd be an idiot not to take that deal.

---

## AKWASI:
I ain't the type a nigga to admit…

---

## FARAH:
I ain't the type to admit to some shit I ain't do.

---

You hear what I'm sayin'?

---

That ain't
right.

---

The principle of that ain't right.




---

## ENOCH:
You're saying you didn't attempt to sell a thousand milligrams of cocaine to an undercover
police officer?

---

## FARAH:
Hell no.

---

## ENOCH:
Because the arresting officer says that you did.

---

## FARAH:
It was one gram.

---

## ENOCH:
That's what I said, a thousand milligrams.

---

## FARAH:
And I ain't try to sell shit.

---

I gave it to him.

---

## ENOCH:
Which is still considered attempt to distribute.

---

## FARAH:
Your semantics are a motherfuckin' trip, dog.

---

## ENOCH:
They're not my semantics they're the semantics of the law.

---

## AKWASI:
And who wrote…

---

## FARAH:

What kinda stupid law is this!?

---

Who wrote it, huh!?

---

WHO?

---

CAVE MEN!?

---

## ENOCH:
You know, perhaps there's a grain of truth in that.

---

Perhaps as a society we're struggling to
find our way back onto a course that we veered off of long ago.

---

But that doesn't solve your
immediate problem.

---

What solves your immediate problem is a guilty plea.

---

## AKWASI:
I ain’t makin’ no plea -

---

## FARAH:
I give some undercover brother a gram of coke, outa the kindness of my heart cause he
look like he havin' a down and out kinda day - and the law is charging me with what?




---

## ENOCH:
Possession of a controlled substance with attempt to distribute.

---

And you're lucky.

---

The
prosecutor's being nice.

---

## FARAH:
He wants to be nice he can drop the charges.
He wants to be nice he can charge me with conspiracy to brighten some two-faced sellout
bitch's day.

---

FUCK THAT!


---

## ENOCH:
Listen, Akwasi, I know this isn't easy to hear, I know it's not, but I'm going to tell you
exactly what I really think.

---

I think you need to find a way… you need to find a place in
your heart somewhere… You have to buy in.

---

[Piano music]

---

You have to buy in to America.

---

[Piano music]

---

As it is.
And as it was.

---

And as it might be.

---

And you have to see yourself in that picture.

---

I'm a Public Defender, okay?

---

I see kids, I see young men, every day - in exactly the same
situation as you're in right now.

---

And I know there's a million reasons why they shouldn't be.

---

I know the deck is stacked against you.

---

I know it because I see you and I see the deck.
And yeah.

---

It's stacked.

---

I'm not gonna sit here and lie to you and tell you that if you play by
the rules everything will work itself out.

---

And I'm not going to lie to you and tell you that
you have the same opportunities a person like me.

---

Who grew up in an environment… I
mean, look, I lost my way and I got high a lot and I did some stupid things and I found my
way back.

---

And I learned and I grew and I prospered.

---

And I realize that if you stray off the
road you have a much greater chance of ending up… I mean… I can't even imagine.

---

But
you.

---

You have to imagine.

---

You have to believe.

---

Even though it's out of reach… you
know there are these success stories.

---

These exceptional people who come from every
background, every disadvantage, and somehow they persevere and they make it.

---

And the
point isn't that we're perfect.

---

Far, far from it.

---

But the point is that we live in a country where
that's possible.

---

Do you see what I'm saying?

---

That's the meaning of a free country.

---

Not that
it's fair.

---

Not even, to be honest, that it's equal.

---

But that it's possible.

---

And I'm humbly asking
you… If you will join me.

---

If you will buy in.

---

To the American Dream.

---

[Piano music]

---

## AKWASI:
Okay, stop.

---

Stop.

---

## AKWASI:

As Akwasi's inevitable future, you might look at me and guess that I did not take the
lawyer's offer that day.

---


And you'd be right.

---


But why didn't I?

---


Or perhaps more precisely: Why couldn't I?

---


The conclusion I have come to over the years is this: 

---

I could not buy in to the American
Dream because I was not willing to spend the currency.

---


And I would not spend the currency,
Because I was the currency.

---


And one cannot use oneself as currency without selling oneself out.

---


Yup.

---

It's a vicious cycle.

---

But what're you gonna do?

---

## AKWASI:
Speaking of American dreams, though:
This suit?

---

You may think it came out of a video game or something, but it's not that far
away.

---

You might see something like this in your lifetime, if you haven't already.

---

I won't get in to the War On Drugs or it's connection with the militarization and Federalization of
local police forces and the slight-of-hand disappearance of our civil liberties - 

---

you're not
likely think of any of these things as legitimate problems--

---

[Sound of lights shutting off]

---

## AKWASI:
Oooh!

---

Hey, perfect.

---

You wanna know what it feels like to have a SWAT team raid your
house in the middle of the night?

---

Check this out.
…
…
…
Okay, pretend you're sleeping!
…
Okay.

---

Pretend you just woke up to this!

---

[A loud BANG!]


---

## AKWASI:
Okay, pretend there's like of me!

---

## AKWASI:
POLICE!

---

FREEZE!

---

I SAID FREEZE
Okay, pretend I'm shooting.

---


POP-POP-POP DADADADADADA!

---


Okay, pretend I just killed somebody you love.
DON'T YOU TOUCH THAT DEAD BODY!

---


DO YOU WANNA BE NEXT!

---


THAT'S WHAT YOU GET FOR HANGING WITH THE WRONG CROWD!

---

YOU SHOULD HAVE CHOSEN YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY MORE CAREFULLY!

---

AND YOU SHOULD HAVE SAID NO TO DRUGS!


---

## AKWASI:

End of scene five.


---

## ENOCH:
That's not the world I want to see.

---

Not at all!
Is that really what you see, Akwasi -

---

## AKWASI:
I call 'em like I see 'em.

---

I'm an artist -

---

## ENOCH:
Cause that's not happening.

---

Not on my watch -

---

## AKWASI:
What are you gonna do?

---

## ENOCH:

Don’t talk to me like I’m the fucking enemy -

---

## AKWASI:
I will break your finger.

---

Point at me one more time -

---

## ENOCH:
You destroyed my life’s work!

---

You said you cared about my heart!

---

## AKWASI:
That was before I realized you didn’t have one!

---

## ENOCH:
How can you possibly say that!?

---

## AKWASI:
I call ‘em like I see ‘em.

---

You’re evil.

---

## ENOCH:
You’re gonna have to break all my fingers ‘cause I’m comin’ at you.

---

## AKWASI:
I wish you would right now.


---

## FARAH:

Both of you sit down.
I’m going to tell you a story.

---


And I’m not gonna ask you to understand it.

---


But you’d better listen to every Goddamn word of it.

---


Do you know why I’m an actor?
DO YOU!?

---

## AKWASI:
No.

---

## FARAH:
Because I got the opportunity.

---


And I got the opportunity because my parents moved us all here when I was six.

---


Before that, we lived in a place with a well, and dirt roads and where all the people had that
dirt underneath their fingernails at all times.

---


And before I was an immigrant, when I was a very young child,

---


Santa Clause lived in my village.

---


She was on old woman, a hermit -- except for those times when she would venture out
around town with a plastic garbage bag full of random stuff, stopping at every house.

---

As
soon as she was spotted by a child,
We would all rush into our homes and sit and wait.



---

## FARAH:
Always we were completely silent.

---


Even the babies knew to be silent.

---


And we would hear footsteps,
And we would hold our breaths,

---


And that bent old woman would shuffle through our doorway.

---


And she would look at each of us, sometimes for quite a long while,

---


And she would meticulously choose from her bag one thing for each child.

---


One year I got a cell phone.

---

It didn’t work of course
But I had countless conversations on it anyway.

---


And when I saw my first American Movie, The Santa Clause starring Tim Allen, I
couldn't believe it.

---


This is not Santa Clause.

---

---



Santa Clause is much older.
And she has no beard, only a few whiskers.

---


And she doesn't ask if you have been naughty or nice.

---


And she doesn't come once a year, she comes whenever she can.

---


And she doesn't take requests.

---

She gives you whatever she has.

---


And I wonder how many Santa Clauses have been just… forgotten.

---


Or how many are among us now.
They're probably everywhere, if you really think about it.

---


And I don’t know what that has to do with slavery, or sinking ships, or social injustice.

---


But it was time for you to know.


---

## FARAH:
Scene six.

---


Dubai.

---


The near future.

[Electronic club music plays]

---

## AKWASI:
…

---

## FARAH:
…


---

## ENOCH:
…

---

## AKWASI:
Happy new year.

---

## FARAH:
Same to you.

---

## ENOCH:
Same.

---

## AKWASI:
Should we toast?

---

## FARAH:
Let's.

---

## ENOCH:
Why not?

---

## FARAH:
You make it.

---

## AKWASI:
Me?

---

## FARAH:
Yes, you.

---

## AKWASI:
To letting go.
Cheers.

---

## FARAH:
You're name.

---

Akwasi.

---

What does it mean?

---

## AKWASI:
Universe.


---

## FARAH:
Really?

---

## AKWASI:
Not literally, but it's implied.

---

## FARAH:
And you're willing to give it up?

---

## AKWASI:
I can't wait to.

---

## FARAH:
Give him his drink.

---

## AKWASI:
What is this?

---

## ENOCH:
Water.

---

## AKWASI:
For?

---

## ENOCH:
Your inner baptism.

---

## FARAH:
Drink it in one gulp.

---

No slurping, no dribbling, no stopping to breathe.

---

## FARAH:
What would you like your new name to be?

---

## AKWASI:
Universe.

---

## FARAH:
Welcome to the club, Universe.

---

How do you feel?

---

## AKWASI:
I feel wonderful.

---

## FARAH:
What questions do you have for me?

---

## AKWASI:
Why are you here?

---

## FARAH:
The same reason you are.

---

I want to be free.

---

## AKWASI:
Doesn’t everybody?

---

## FARAH:
I was slave.

---

So I know what I’m talking about.

---

## AKWASI:
What kind of slave?

---

## FARAH:
Sex.

---

## AKWASI:
Oh.

---

## FARAH:
And here’s something you may not want to hear:
I had to face the darkness.

---

My own, especially.

---

## ENOCH:
It’s not as easy as it seems, facing one’s darkness.

---

It’s hard to see.

---

## FARAH:
I made the shift when I realized that I wasn’t merely a cog in the pleasure-industrial-
complex.

---

I was in the business of survival.

---

I had to climb the ladder made available to me.

---

I had to make my condition into a profession.
It’s not about skill.

---

Or even beauty.

---

It’s tenacity.

---

Bravery.

---

Where you’re willing to go.
What unspeakable thing you’re willing to do.

---

Or say.

---

Or make someone believe.

---

What twisted world you’re willing to play in.

---

I did what I had to do.

---

And I bought my own freedom.


---

## FARAH:
And for a time, I even owned my own slaves.

---

And I had to face down my own twisted
soul before, finally, I could set them free.

---


And now, I’m a life coach.

---


And I’m a good one.

---


Because I haven’t forgotten the lessons of my darkness.

---


So:
What can I do for you?

---

## AKWASI:
Teach me.

---

## FARAH:
Teach you what?

---

## AKWASI:
I don’t know.

---

I don’t know anything anymore.

---

That’s why I’m here, I guess.
Teach me the thing I don’t know I need to be taught.

---

## FARAH:
…
There will never be an alien invasion war that we have a chance of winning.

---

## AKWASI:
Oh.

---

Okay.

---

## FARAH:
Think about it.

---

## ENOCH:
Really think.

---

## AKWASI:
I’m thinking.

---

## FARAH:
Why would extraterrestrials want to enslave, colonize or annihilate us?

---

Why do we assume
that?

---

## ENOCH:
Makes no sense.

---

## FARAH:
Aren't we maybe projecting a little?


---

## ENOCH:
Maybe a lot.

---

## FARAH:
Isn't that more like some shit we would do?

---

If God forbid we were given the ability travel
to other planets I'm sure we would colonize.

---

And pillage.

---

And kidnap.

---

And probe anuses.
We'd do all of that.

---


Unless somehow by then our humanity evolves as well.

---


And that’s what we’re about.

---

## ENOCH:
Welcome to the real real.

---

Welcome to the truth.

---

## AKWASI:
Do people think that’s gonna happen?

---

That some kind of alien invasion is coming?

---

## FARAH:
Among other things, sure.
They’re being prepped.

---

## AKWASI:
Why?

---

## ENOCH:
Fear keeps people in line.

---

It's a necessary evil.

---

You know, maybe it's not even an evil.
Maybe it's a good.

---

## FARAH:
Never be afraid, Universe.

---

No matter what anyone tells you.

---

About anything.

---

Never be
afraid.

---

Because you can become anything you want to become.

---

## AKWASI:
We should tell that to people!

---

We should tell everyone never to be afraid.

---

We should tell
everyone that they can rename themselves.

---

That they can do anything they put their minds
to!

---

## FARAH:
We can't.

---

## ENOCH:
Holy shit I just blew my own mind!

---

Evil is good.




---

## FARAH:
No, evil is not good.

---

## AKWASI:
Why can't we tell people?

---

The world is sick.

---

People need to know that they can make
themselves better!

---

## FARAH:
We can’t tell them.

---

We have to teach them.
We have to teach them to look.

---

And then they'll see the truth.
And when they've seen the truth, with their own eyes, 

---

they will know the truth.

---


And when they know the truth.

---

That's when they'll be free.

---

## ENOCH:
I'm free!

---

For the first time in my life I'm free!

---

I see it!

---

## AKWASI:
But do I know the truth?

---

## FARAH:
Do you?

---

## ENOCH:
It feels so great to be free!

---

## AKWASI:
You told me.

---

## FARAH:
But you asked for it.

---

## AKWASI:
But you told me.

---

## ENOCH:
I have to do something!

---

I can be evil now, I have to do something!

---

## FARAH:
Hold that thought please -

When I told you did you think it was true?

---

Or did you know it was true?

---

## AKWASI:
I knew it was true.


---

## FARAH:
Then you know.

---

## AKWASI:
But now I'm thinking about it.

---

## FARAH:

Now: evil is not good.

---

Evil is bad.
Please say you believe me.
We’ve had enough evil.

---

We really, really have.

---

## ENOCH:
You don't understand, ever since I was a little kid I've really, reallly, really, wanted to fight
fire with fire.

---

I always believed in my heart that if you had enough fire, you could beat fire.

---


When I was a kid, the only thing I ever wanted to be was a fireman.

---

I was set.

---

I had my
career mapped out.

---

I was gonna be a hero.

---

An every day hero with a lunch pail and helmet,
I mean what more could you…

---


And finally, I'm like at this point and don't ask me how this got past me, 

---

but my dad
takes me to the firehouse for like a little tour and I meet everybody, and I'm like,

---


Wait, there's water in those hoses?

---

I thought you were firemen!
Cause every picture I've ever seen--

---

for some reason they used to put these live action
firefighting shots at Applebees, don't ask me why--

---

and every picture I've seen there's a
bunch of firemen, you know, burning down a house!

---

Now you're telling me I don't get to
burn shit down?

---

You're telling me those firehoses aren't spraying blue and white fire?

---

Look
at them.

---

Look at any of those pictures with the eyes of a child and tell me that doesn't look
like blue fire.

---

That's textbook blue fire.

---


And it distresses me that somehow, someway, I have this… this overwhelming desire to
destroy things.

---

I really do.

---

## AKWASI:
Hm.

---

## FARAH:
Okay… let’s just -

---

## ENOCH:
These people, all of 'em around here.

---

Fuckin' sleazeballs.

---

American Sleazeballs mixing with
Arab sleazeballs mixing with European sleazeballs.

---

You know what I'm saying?
Conspiring to rape Africa for the rest of eternity.

---

Keeping everything for themselves.
I'm here for a reason.

---

I'm on this earth for a reason.

---

I took the vow, I chose a new name.
I'm Tony, now.

---

And Tony's a great name for a firefighter.

---

And Tony believes that maybe
things… this fire is in me for a reason.


---

## ENOCH:
If destruction is the best I can do, it's just a matter of making war on the right people.

---

Does
that make any sense?
Thanks for being here with me.

---

You might wanna…

---

## ENOCH:
Boom.


---

[Massive explosion. Ringing]

---



---



## AKWASI:
Let’s do it differently this time around, huh?


---

## ENOCH:
Okay.

---

## AKWASI:
Let’s keep pressing into the future.

---

## ENOCH:
How far?

---

## FARAH:
Far.

---

## FARAH:
Scene seven.

---


The distant, distant future.

---


A distant, distant planet.

---


Our distant, distant descendants,
Descend for a visit.

---

[Sci-Fi Sounds]

---


## AKWASI:
I almost forgot how much I can't stand this.

---

## ENOCH:
What?

---

## AKWASI:
Walking around in the fourth dimension.

---

## ENOCH:
You'll get used to it.

---

## AKWASI:
I feel like I'm… inside my own blood.

---

If that makes sense.

---

## ENOCH:
Yeah, totally.

---

That's the idea.

---

You just have to embrace it.

---

Use it.


---

## AKWASI:
Use what?

---

## ENOCH:
Your blood.

---

Swim in it.
Easy does it.

---


Ride the current.

---


Glide on the wave of yourself.

---

## AKWASI:
I don't know how to glide on the wave of myself.

---

## ENOCH:
Akwasi, no, stay here.

---

Stay in this dimension, we can't be seen.

---

## AKWASI:
Ain't nobody out here yet.

---

## ENOCH:
What happened to your patience?

---

## AKWASI:
My patience is on Earth.

---

In my garden, specifically.

---

Waiting for the Asparagus to ripen.

---

## ENOCH:
It is about Asparagus time, isn't it?

---

## AKWASI:
Mhmm.

---

## ENOCH:
I do enjoy fresh asparagus.

---

## AKWASI:
No doubt.

---

Only two weeks outa the year that it's fresh fresh, knowhatimsayin'.

---

I'd
probably be clippin it right now, gettin' the pan ready.

---

Sprinkle a little yak butter on that
shit?

---

## ENOCH:
Sounds nice.

---

## AKWASI:
You don't know nothin' about no yak butter, though.

---

## ENOCH:
I'll take your word for it.
[Keys clacking, computer beeps]


---

## AKWASI:
Magic ingredient baby boy, ain't no dish it can't improve.

---

Especially cereal bakes--whoo!
Tellin' you.

---

Come by my place sometime I'll make you a meanass yak butter cereal bake.

---

## ENOCH:
I think I might like that.

---

## AKWASI:
Yeah?

---

Alright.

---

I’m off all next week.

---

Come by.

---

## ENOCH:
Thank you.
I haven't had a cereal bake since college.

---

## AKWASI:
You've gotta be fuckin' kidding me.

---

## ENOCH:
I haven't been home since college.

---

## AKWASI:
Are you serious, dog?

---

## ENOCH:
Got my degree seven years ago.

---

Graduation ceremony at sunrise, started training with
Transgalactic by noon, given my own vessel at sundown.

---

Ever since, back and forth and
back and forth.

---

Never home.

The high seas are my home.

---

## AKWASI:
That don't sound balanced.

---

## ENOCH:
It's not, but I don't really feel the effects.

---

## AKWASI:
You don't?

---

## ENOCH:
I was born with psychopathy, so…

---

## AKWASI:
Ohhhhhh, I had no idea.


---

## ENOCH:
I don't like to…

---

## AKWASI:
Thought you was just mad dedicated -

---

## ENOCH:
Well, I am dedicated -

---

## AKWASI:
Seven years of this.

---

I can't even imagine.

---

## ENOCH:
It's not a bad gig at all
.

---

## AKWASI:
To tell you the truth I don’t really know what y’all do.

---

They only send me in for the
exciting stuff.

---

## ENOCH:
Well, I have perform a range of tasks.

---

Atmospheric diagnostics, chemical composition,
temperature readings, it's what you might call tedious.

---

And then I have to verify all my data
by spot checking from at least four variant dimensions.

---

It’s endless.

---

But that’s life.

---


## AKWASI:
And we have lift off.


---

## AKWASI:
You sure we can't slip back into her dimensionality?

---

She might see us, but it would be a
lot quicker.

---


## ENOCH:
It's not my decision it's policy -

---

## AKWASI:
Yeah, yeah, yeah, play by the book.
I’m just tired of blood gliding my ass around.

---

## ENOCH:
Understandable.

---

## AKWASI:
Oh, great, this is gonna be a lotta fun.

---

All this emotional turbulence.

---

## AKWASI:
Just have to ask for the record: Is she the first native, humanoid lifeform you've seen on
this planet?
[Machine whirring]

---

## ENOCH:
Yes.

---

## AKWASI:

Do you have any reason to believe that she is not
a native of this planet?

---

## ENOCH:
No.

---

## AKWASI:
Have you experienced any dreams, hallucinations, or otherwise mystical experiences
carrying the imprint of her persona?

---

## ENOCH:
…
I don't think so.

---

## AKWASI:
Good enough for me.

---

## ENOCH:
Why is she crying, do you suppose?

---

## AKWASI:
Her heart looks broken.

---

## ENOCH:
Why does she not fix it?

---

## AKWASI:
She probably doesn't know how.

---

## ENOCH:
You can do it.

---

One breath at a time.

---

There.

---

There you go.

---

Why the broken heart?

---

## AKWASI:
No way to know for sure without talking to her.

---

Can you slip your hands, just under her
jaw there?

---

## ENOCH:
Like this?

---

## AKWASI:
Yes.

---

## ENOCH:
You need a reading?

---

## AKWASI:
Yeah, just her Fahrenheit.

---

## ENOCH:
99 even.

---

## AKWASI:
Thanks.

---

## ENOCH:
Is that normal?

---

## AKWASI:
Just getting a baseline.

---

She's in an agitated state, that may have some affect.

---

No way of
knowing yet.

---

## ENOCH:
How smart is she?

---

## AKWASI:
She's got a beautiful brain.

---

Absolutely gorgeous.


---

## ENOCH:
How advanced?

---

Please don't say “no way of knowing.”

---

## AKWASI:
Time will tell.
If I had to make an educated guess, I'd say she's crying for her future.

---

I'd say she's got
some mountains to climb.

---

## ENOCH:
Hm.

---

## AKWASI:
That's not going in the report, just my opinion.

---

## ENOCH:
You can do it.

---

You can do anything you put your mind to doing.

---

Do you believe that yet,
young woman?

---

She doesn't believe it.

---

## AKWASI:
Not yet.

---

## ENOCH:
Then how does she bear her sadness?

---

## AKWASI:
She has no choice.

---

It's where she is.

---

The sort of paradox these primitive peoples face is that
most of them haven't developed the capacity to figure out where the hell they're going.

---

It's
like trying to walk to the light at the end of the tunnel - only you can't see the light.

---

And
you don't know you're in a tunnel.

---

## ENOCH:
Does she feel us now?

---

## AKWASI:
I think she may.

---

No way to know for sure.

---

## ENOCH:
What do we feel like to her?

---

## AKWASI:
If anything, she feels a sort of warmth in the middle of her chest.

---

Sometimes it just
intensifies--




---


## AKWASI:
There we go!

---

## ENOCH:
Whoa!

---

We helped her do that?

---

## AKWASI:
A little.

---

## ENOCH:
Does she still need us?

---

## AKWASI:
Based on her astral body signature she's got pretty solid multidimensional support.

---

## ENOCH:
So she doesn't need us?

---

## AKWASI:
She'll be fine either way.

---

## ENOCH:
But she'll be a little better if we stay?

---

## AKWASI:
Perhaps a little.

---

## ENOCH:
You wanna get back to earth.

---

## AKWASI:
No, we can stay awhile.

---

## ENOCH:
Your asparagus.

---

## AKWASI:
No, it can wait.

---

## ENOCH:
She's perfect, isn't she?


---

## AKWASI:
Yes.

---

## ENOCH:
We'll make sure she's alright?

---

## FARAH:
Mulakaaaabu.

---

Nanaamaka.

---

Lubaaashanay.

---

[Wind Chimes]

---




---

## FARAH:
Well.

---


It looks like this will be our curtain call.

---


I’m not sure what language I was just speaking.

---


And I don’t think there’s a direct English translation for what I said.

---


But it was a prayer for strength.

---


The strength to take the next step on the path.

---


I’m a traveller.

---

The road means everything to me.

---


And now I bow and become the road itself,
In hopes that I’ve made your way a little brighter.

---

## ENOCH:
Let this theatre die again.

---


For death will erase our faults,
And tomorrow’s resurrectors will do better.

---


And if even one truth we’ve uncovered tonight
Can linger in this air, or in your hearts,

---


The life I’ve chosen to live is not in vain.

---


And to that bounty, I cannot help but bow.
Like grass to wind.

---

## AKWASI:
My people,
My people,
My people.
