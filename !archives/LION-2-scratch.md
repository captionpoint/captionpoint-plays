ACT TWO

---

## ELEANOR:
How beautiful you make me.

---

What might Solomon have sung had he seen this?
I can’t.

---

I’d turn to salt.
I’ve lost again.

---

I’m done, for now.

---

Well – there’ll be other Christmases.
They kissed sweetly, didn’t they?

---

I’ll have him next time.

---

I can wait.
Ah, there you are; my comfort and my company.

---

We’re locked in for another year: four seasons more.

---

Oh, what a desolation, what a life’s work.
Is it too much?

---

Be sure to squint as you approach.

---

You may be blinded by my beauty.


---

## GEOFFREY:
Richard’s raging all around the castle

---

## ELEANOR:
Is he?

---

Why?


---

## GEOFFREY:
He says it’s got to do with being held a prisoner, but I think he likes to rage.

---

## ELEANOR:
And John?


---

## GEOFFREY:
John’s skipping after Richard, saying naughty things.

---

## ELEANOR:
And you?

---

## GEOFFREY:
I thought you might be lonely.

---

## ELEANOR:
Here, Chancellor.

---

Try it on for size.


---

## GEOFFREY:
Why do you think so little of me?


---

## ELEANOR:
Little?

---

Never that.

---

Whatever you are, you’re not little.


---

## GEOFFREY:
I remember my third birthday.

---

Not just pictures of the garden or the gifts, but who did what to whom and how it felt.

---

My memory reaches back that far and never once can I remember anything from you or Father warmer than indifference.

---

Why is that?


---

## ELEANOR:
I don’t know.

---

## GEOFFREY:
That was not an easy question for me and I don’t deserve an easy answer.


---

## ELEANOR:
There are times I think we loved none of our children.

---

## GEOFFREY:
Still too easy, don’t you think?

---

## ELEANOR:
I’m weary and you want a simple answer, and I haven’t one.
I read minds.

---

In yours, a shapely hand is writing, “Clever Mother, what’s your clever reason for this clever talk?

---

”
I’m so sick of all of you.

---

## JOHN:
I thought I’d come and gloat a little.


---

## ELEANOR:
Mother’s tired.

---

Come and stick pins tomorrow morning; I’ll be more responsive then.


---

## JOHN:
It’s not fun goading anyone tonight.


---

## ELEANOR:
Come, let me look at you.

---

I’m full of looks this evening.

---

I have looked a little in the mirror and I’ve read a passage in your brother’s mind; what’s there to see in you?

---

A little me, a little Henry, and a lot of some – one I don’t know.
Oh, John.


---

## RICHARD:
The bastard’s boxed us up.

---

## ELEANOR:
What’s that, dear?

---

## RICHARD:
I’ve got to go to Poitiers.

---

Henry wants a war; I’ll give him one.

---

## ELEANOR:
I don’t see how.

---

## RICHARD:
You seem to take that calmly.

---

## ELEANOR:
Well?

---

## RICHARD:
It was – correct me if I’m wrong, but it was my impression that you wanted Henry’s throne for me.


---

## ELEANOR:
We’ve lost this time, Richard.

---

We can’t win.


---

## RICHARD:
You think I’m finished, do you?

---

## ELEANOR:
So I do.

---

I’ve suffered more defeats than you have teeth.

---

I know one when it’s here.


---

## RICHARD:
I will be king.

---

## ELEANOR:
And so you will.

---

But not this year – and what’s it matter to me anyway?

---

The world stops when I die.


---

## RICHARD:
Yours does; mine doesn’t.

---

## ELEANOR:
Leave it, Richard.

---

Let it go for now.

---

I have.

---

## RICHARD:
I can’t.

---

## JOHN:
It’s not so hard.

---

Trying saying after me: John wins, I lose.


---

## RICHARD:
What if John died?

---

## JOHN:
What’s that?

---

## RICHARD:
What if he left us suddenly.

---

## JOHN:
You wouldn’t dare.


---

## RICHARD:
Why on earth wouldn’t I?

---

## JOHN:
A knife – he’s got a knife.


---

## ELEANOR:
Of course, he’s got a knife.

---

He’s always got a knife.

---

We’ve all got knives.

---

It is eleven eighty-three and we’re still barbarians.

---

How clear we make it.

---

Oh, my piglets, we are the origins of war.

---

Not history’s forces nor the times nor justice nor the lack of it nor causes nor religions nor ideas nor kinds of government nor any other thing.

---

We are killers; we breed war.

---

We carry it, like syphilis, inside.

---

Dead bodies rot in field and stream because the living ones are rotten.

---

For the love of God, can’t we love one another just a little?


---

## GEOFFREY:
And while we hugged each other, what would Philip do?


---

## JOHN:
Oh good God – Philip.

---

We’re supposed to start a war.

---

If Father finds out, I’ll be ruined.


---

## GEOFFREY:
Steady, John: don’t panic.

---

## JOHN:
Some advisor you are.

---

## GEOFFREY:
Don’t do anything without me.

---

Let me handle it.


---

## JOHN:
If you’re so clever, why am I always doing something stupid?

---

## ELEANOR:
Well, Geoffrey.

---

He’s made a pact with Philip.

---

You advised John into making war.

---

That peerless boy: he’s disinherited himself.

---

When Henry finds out, when I tell him what John’s done – I need a little time.

---

Can you keep John away from Philip until I say so?

---

## GEOFFREY:
Anything you say.


---

## ELEANOR:
I want you out of Chinon before this breaks.

---

And for that we need Philip.

---

He has soldiers with him if he’ll use them.

---

Go to him, be desperate, promise anything: the Vexin, Brittany.

---

Then once you’re free and John is out of favor, we’ll make further plans.


---

## RICHARD:
You talk to Philip.

---

You’re the diplomat; you see him.


---

## ELEANOR:
You’re a friend.

---

You know him; I don’t.

---

Quickly now.
And, Richard.
Promise anything.
I haven’t lost, it isn’t over.

---

Oh, I’ve got the old man this time.

---

The damn fool thinks he loves John, he believes it.

---

That’s where the knife goes in.

---

Knives, knives…
Where’s that mirror?

---

I am Eleanor and I can look at anything.
My, what a lovely girl.

---

How could her king have left her?


---

## GEOFFREY:
Philip, Philip – is John here?

---

## PHILIP:
Here?

---

In my room?

---

## GEOFFREY:
Come on, Philip; this is me.

---

## PHILIP:
I’ve been expecting him.

---

## GEOFFREY:
If the whole thing breaks tonight; then we’ve reached the end of it.

---

## PHILIP:
If that’s a warning, thank you.


---

## GEOFFREY:
What if it’s an offer?

---

## PHILIP:
“What if” is a game for scholars: what if angels sat on pinheads?

---

## GEOFFREY:
What if I were king?

---

## PHILIP:
It’s your game, Geoff, you play if.

---

## GEOFFREY:
All of England’s land in France, from Normandy down to the Spanish border, once I’m king.


---

## PHILIP:
All that.

---

What could I do that’s worth all that?


---

## GEOFFREY:
By morning I can be the chosen son.

---

The crown can come to me.

---

But once it does, once Henry’s favor falls my way, the war begins.


---

## PHILIP:
We have so many wars.

---

Which one is this?


---

## GEOFFREY:
The one that Richard, John and Eleanor will make.

---

I’ll have to fight to keep what Henry, in his rage, is going to give me.


---

## PHILIP:
Yes, you will.

---

## GEOFFREY:
That’s why I need you, Philip.

---

Will you fight with me against them all?

---

## PHILIP:
Against them all?

---

## GEOFFREY:
Don’t tell me it’s a risk.

---

I wouldn’t hand you half of France to fight an easy war.


---

## PHILIP:
I wouldn’t want you for an enemy.

---

## GEOFFREY:
Are we allies, then?

---

## PHILIP:
We were born to be.


---

## GEOFFREY:
I should say something solemn, but I haven’t time.

---

I’m off to Father with news that John’s a traitor.

---

After that –


---

## JOHN:
You stink, you know that?

---

You’re a stinker and you stink.

---

## GEOFFREY:
Come on.

---

We’re finished here.

---

## JOHN:
I’ll kill you.

---

Where’s a dagger?

---

## GEOFFREY:
Hush, John, or you’ll spoil everything.

---

## JOHN:
A sword, a spear, a candlestick.
It’s light’s out, stinker.


---

## GEOFFREY:
If you’re a prince, there’s hope for every ape in Africa.

---

I had you saved.

---

I wasn’t on my way to Father – but he was.

---

He would have gone to Henry and betrayed you.

---

Look: it’s in his face.


---

## JOHN:
Oh.

---

It’s true.

---

I don’t know who my friends are.


---

## RICHARD:
Philip.


---

## GEOFFREY:
May we?


---

## PHILIP:
That’s what tapestries are for.


---

## JOHN:
I’ve ruined everything.

---

I’ll never learn.


---

## PHILIP:
Is someone there?

---

I heard my name.


---

## RICHARD:
I called it.

---

## PHILIP:
Richard.

---

Hello Richard.

---

## RICHARD:
You’re halfway to bed.

---

I’ll wait for morning.

---

## PHILIP:
Come in.

---

## RICHARD:
Mother sent me.

---

## PHILIP:
Come in anyway.

Our alchemists have stumbled on the art of boiling burgundy.

---

It turns to steam and when it cools, we call it Brandywine.


---

## RICHARD:
I’m Henry’s prisoner.

---

## PHILIP:
So you said you’d go to war and Henry drew the drawbridge on you.

---

## RICHARD:
Do you find that charming?

---

## PHILIP:
No.

---

## RICHARD:
Then why the charming smile?

---

## PHILIP:
I thought, I can’t think why, of when you were in Paris last.

---

Can it be two whole years ago?


---

## RICHARD:
It can.

---

I need an army, Philip.

---

## PHILIP:
It will take the cold away.


---

## RICHARD:
I must have soldiers.

---

## PHILIP:
Have I aged?

---

Do I seem older to you?

---

They’ve been two fierce years: I’ve studied, and I’ve trained to be a king.


---

## RICHARD:
I’ll have your answer – yes or no.

---

## PHILIP:
You’ll have it when I give it.

See?

---

I’ve changed.

---

I’m not the boy you taught to hunt two years ago.

---

Remember?

---

Racing after boar, you flying first, me scrambling after, all day to dusk –

---

## RICHARD:
I’ll try another time.

---

## PHILIP:
Don’t go.


---

## RICHARD:
I must know: will you help me?


---

## PHILIP:
Sit and we’ll discuss it.
You never write.

---

## RICHARD:
To anyone.

---

## PHILIP:
Why should I make you King of England?

---

Aren’t I better off with John or Geoffrey?

---

Why have you to fight when I could have the cretin or the fiend?


---

## RICHARD:
Would we fight?


---

## PHILIP:
We’re fighting now.
Good night.

---

## RICHARD:
You’re still a boy.


---

## PHILIP:
In some ways.

---

Which way did you have in mind?


---

## RICHARD:
You haven’t asked me how much you’re worth to me.

---

## PHILIP:
You’ll tell me.

---

## RICHARD:
You can have the Vexin back.

---

## PHILIP:
And what else?

---

## RICHARD:
All of Brittany.

---

## PHILIP:
That’s Geoffrey’s.

---

## RICHARD:
Does that matter?


---

## PHILIP:
Possibly to Geoffrey.

---

And what else?

---

## RICHARD:
That’s all your help is worth.

---

## PHILIP:
And in return, what do you want from me?

---

## RICHARD:
Two thousand soldiers.

---

## PHILIP:
And what else?

---

## RICHARD:
Five hundred knights on horse.

---

## PHILIP:
And what else?

---

## RICHARD:
Arms and siege equipment.


---

## PHILIP:
And what else?

---

## RICHARD:
I never wrote because I thought you’d never answer.
You got married.

---

## PHILIP:
Does that make a difference?

---

## RICHARD:
Doesn’t it?

---

## PHILIP:
I’ve spent two years on every street in hell.


---

## RICHARD:
That’s odd: I didn’t see you there.
You haven’t said you love me.

---

## PHILIP:
When the time comes.

---

## HENRY:
(Offstage, calling.)
Philip.

---

## RICHARD:
Don’t go.

---

## PHILIP:
Hush.


---

## RICHARD:
Philip…

Hurry.


---

## HENRY:
(Still offstage.)
Philip, lad.


---

## PHILIP:
Is someone there?


---

## HENRY:
I am.

---

It’s not too late at night?

---

## PHILIP:
I’ve been expecting you.

---

## HENRY:
Oh, have you.

---

## PHILIP:
See – two glasses.

---

I did hope you’d come.


---

## HENRY:
Good; we can’t leave negotiations where they are.

---

I’ve seen more royal rooms.

---

I keep looking for your father in you.


---

## PHILIP:
He’s not there.

---

## HENRY:
I miss him.

---

Has Richard or the Queen been here to see you?


---

## PHILIP:
Does it matter?

---

If they haven’t, they will.


---

## HENRY:
I want to reach a settlement.

---

I left you with too little earlier.

---

## PHILIP:
Yes, nothing is too little.

---

## HENRY:
I am sorry you’re not fonder of me, lad.

---

Your father always said, “Be fond of stronger men.”


---

## PHILIP:
No wonder he loved everyone.

---

## HENRY:
They’ll offer you whole provinces to fight me.


---

## PHILIP:
Shocking.

---

My advice to you is discipline your children.

---

## HENRY:
I came here to offer peace.


---

## PHILIP:
Piss on your peace.

---

## HENRY:
Your father would have wept.

---

## PHILIP:
My father was a weeper.

---

## HENRY:
Fight me and you’ll lose.

---

## PHILIP:
I can’t lose, Henry.

---

I have time.

---

Just look at you.

---

Your strong arms – they’d crush me like a leave of lettuce.

---

But each year they get a little weaker.

---

The sand goes pit-pat in the glass.

---

I’m in no hurry, Henry.

---

I’ve got time.


---

## HENRY:
Suppose I hurry things along?

---

What if I say that England is at war with France?


---

## PHILIP:
Then France surrenders.

---

I don’t have to fight to win.

---

Take all you want – this county, that one.

---

You won’t keep it long.


---

## HENRY:
What kind of courage have you got?

---

## PHILIP:
The tidal kind: it comes and goes.

---

## HENRY:
By God, I’d love to turn you loose on Eleanor.

---

More Brandywine?

---

## PHILIP:
You recognize it?

---

## HENRY:
They were boiling it in Ireland before the snakes left.

---

Well, things look a little bleak for Henry, don’t they?

---

You’ll say yes to Richard when he comes; arms, soldiers, anything he asks for.


---

## PHILIP:
I’d be foolish not to.

---

## HENRY:
And withdraw it all before the battle ever started.

---

## PHILIP:
Wouldn’t you, in my place?


---

## HENRY:
Why fight Henry when his sones will do it for you?

---

## PHILIP:
Yes, exactly.

---

## HENRY:
You’ve got promise, lad.

---

That’s first class thinking.

---

## PHILIP:
Thank you, sir.


---

## HENRY:
Good night.


Good night?

---

You’re going?
But we haven’t settled anything.
---

## PHILIP:

---

## HENRY:
We open Christmas packages at noon.

---

Till then.


---

## PHILIP:
You can’t be finished with me.

---

## HENRY:
But I am.

---

And it’s been very satisfactory.

---

## PHILIP:
What’s so satisfactory?

---

## HENRY:
Winning is.

---

I did just win.

---

Surely you noticed.


---

## PHILIP:
Not a thing.

---

You haven’t won a damn thing.


---

## HENRY:
I’ve found out the way your mind works and the kind of man you are.

---

I know your plans and expectations.

---

You have burbled every bit of strategy you’ve got.

---

I know exactly what you’ll do and exactly what you won’t.

---

And I’ve told you exactly nothing.

---

To these aged eyes, boy, that’s what winning looks like.

---

Donnez bien.


---

## PHILIP:
One time, when I was very small, I watched some soldiers take their dinner pig and truss it up and put the thing, alive and kicking, on the fire.

---

That’s the sound I’m going to hear from you.


---

## HENRY:
And I thought you lacked passion.


---

## PHILIP:
You – you made my father nothing.

---

You were always better.

---

You bullied him, you bellied with his wife, you beat him down in every war, you twisted treaty and then you made him love you for it.

---

I was there: his last words went to you.


---

## HENRY:
He was a loving man and you learned nothing of it.


---

## PHILIP:
I learned how much fathers live in sons.

---

A king like you has policy prepared on everything.

---

What’s the official line on sodomy?

---

How stands the Crown on boys who do with boys?


---

## HENRY:
Richard finds his way into so many legends.

---

Let’s hear yours and see how it compares.


---

## PHILIP:
He found me first when I was fifteen.

---

We were hunting.

---

It was nearly dark.

---

I lost my way.

---

My horse fell.

---

I was thrown.

---

I woke to Richard touching me.

---

He asked me if I loved him – Philip, do you love me?

---

– and I told him yes.


---

## HENRY:
I’ve heard much better.

---

## PHILIP:
You know why I told him yes?

---

So one day I could tell you all about it.

---

You cannot imagine what that yes cost.

---

Or perhaps you can.

---

Imagine snuggling to a poxied, chancred whore and, bending back your lips in something like a smile, saying, “Yes I love you and I find you beautiful.

---

” I don’t know how I did it.

---

## RICHARD:
No!

---

It wasn’t like that.

---

## PHILIP:
But it was.

---

## RICHARD:
You loved me.

---

## PHILIP:
Never.

---

## RICHARD:
Get your sword.

---

You’ve got one.

---

Pick it up.


---

## PHILIP:
He’s your responsibility; you talk to him.

---

## RICHARD:
Get out.

---

Please!

---

I don’t want you here.

---

## HENRY:
It’s no great joy to be here.

---

## RICHARD:
So the royal corkscrew finds me twisted, does he?


---

## HENRY:
I’ll go tell your mother: she’ll be pleased.

---

## RICHARD:
She knows: she sent me here.

---

## HENRY:
How completely hers you are.


---

## RICHARD:
You’ve had four sons.

---

Who do you claim?

---

Not my buried brother, Henry?

---

Not that monument too much, that epic idiot, oh, surely not.


---

## HENRY:
The boy is dead.

---

## RICHARD:
Let’s praise him, then.

---

Who can forget his Roquefort smile, his absent brow, those apey eyes, that spoon edged mind?

---

Why him?

---

Why him and never me?


---

## HENRY:
He was the oldest.

---

He came first.

---

## RICHARD:
Christ, Henry, is that all?

---

## HENRY:
You went with Eleanor.

---

## RICHARD:
You never called for me.

---

You never said my name.

---

I would have walked or crawled.

---

I’d have done anything.


---

## HENRY:
It’s not my fault.

---

I won’t be blamed.

---

## RICHARD:
I only wanted you.

---

## HENRY:
No – it’s my crown.

---

You want my kingdom.

---

## RICHARD:
Keep your kingdom.

---

## HENRY:
That I will.

---

## RICHARD:
I hope it kills you.

---

## HENRY:
I thank God I have another son.

---

Thank God for John.


---

## GEOFFREY:
Who shall we thank for Geoffrey?
You don’t think much of me.

---

## HENRY:
Much?

---

I don’t think of you at all.

---

## GEOFFREY:
Nurse used to say I had your hands; I might have more of you.

---

Try seeing me.

---

I haven’t Richard’s military skill; but he was here betraying you, not I.

---

I haven’t John’s I don’t know what – God knows what you can see in John – and he’s betrayed you, too.

---

There’s only me.


---

## HENRY:
You think I’d ever make you king?

---

## GEOFFREY:
You’ll make me king because I’m all you’ve got.
I was to be his chancellor.

---

Ask him why.

---

## HENRY:
I’ve heard enough.


---

## GEOFFREY:
For moving John to treason.

---

## HENRY:
I don’t doubt he offered, I don’t doubt you tried, and I don’t doubt John loves me.


---

## GEOFFREY:
Like a glutton loves his lunch.


---

## JOHN:
You turd.

---

## PHILIP:
I leave you now.

---

I would not want my presence to temper the festivities.

---

## HENRY:
Well, John?

---

## JOHN:
It isn’t what you think.


---

## HENRY:
What do I think?

---

## JOHN:
What Geoffrey said.

---

I wouldn’t plot against you, ever.

---

## HENRY:
I know; you’re a good boy.

---

## JOHN:
Can I go now, please?

---

It’s late.

---

I ought to be in bed.

---

## HENRY:
You fool.

---

## JOHN:
Me?

---

What have I done now?

---

## HENRY:
Couldn’t you wait?

---

Couldn’t you trust me?

---

It was all yours.

---

Couldn’t you believe that?


---

## JOHN:
Will you listen to the grief?


---

## HENRY:
Who do you think I built this kingdom for?


---

## JOHN:
Me?

---

Daddy did it all for me?

---

When can I have it, Daddy?

---

Not until we bury you?


---

## HENRY:
You’re just like them.

---

And after all I’ve given you.

---

## JOHN:
I know what you gave.

---

## HENRY:
I loved you.

---

## JOHN:
You’re a cold and bloody bastard, you are, and you don’t love anything.


---

## GEOFFREY:
I’m it, I’m all that’s left.

---

Here, Father; here I am.


---

## HENRY:
My life, when it is written, will read better than it lived.

---

Henry Fitz-Empress, first Plantagenet, a king at twenty-one, the ablest soldier of an able time.

---


He led men well, he cared for justice when he could and ruled for thirty years, a state as great as Charlemagne’s.

---

He married, out of love, a woman of legend.

---

Not in Alexandria or Rome or Camelot has there been such a queen.

---

She bore him many children – but no sons.

---

King Henry had no sons.

---

He had three whiskered things but he disowned them.

---

You’re not mine.

---

I deny you.

---

None of you will get my crown.

---

I leave you nothing and I wish you plague.

---

May all your children breech and die.
You dare to damn me, do you?

---

Well, I damn you back.

---

God damn you.

---

All my boys are gone.

---

I’ve lost my boys.

---

Oh Jesus, all my boys.

---

## ALAIS:
(Singing softly)
♪The Christmas wine is in the pot, The Christmas coals are red.♪
♪I’ll spend my day, The lovers’ way♪

---


♪Unwrapping my gifts in bed.♪

---

♪The Christmas goose is on the spit,♪
♪The Christmas…♪


---

## ELEANOR:
No one else is caroling tonight.

---

It might as well be Lent.

---

## ALAIS:
Henry isn’t here.

---

## ELEANOR:
Good; we can talk behind his back.


---

## ALAIS:
He’s outside walking.

---

## ELEANOR:
In this cold?

---

## ALAIS:
He’ll never notice it.

---

What happened?

---

## ELEANOR:
Don’t you know?

---

## ALAIS:
He came and stood awhile by the fire and went away.

---

You would have liked the way he looked.


---

## ELEANOR:
There was a scene with beds and tapestries and many things got said.

---

Spiced wine: I’d forgotten Henry liked it.

---

May I stay?


---

## ALAIS:
It’s your room just as much as mine: we’re both in residence.


---

## ELEANOR:
Packed in, like the poor, three to a bed.


---

## ALAIS:
Did you love Henry – ever?

---

## ELEANOR:
Ever?

---

Back before the flood?

---

## ALAIS:
As long ago as Rosamund.

---

## ELEANOR:
Ah, that’s pre-history, lamb; there are no written records or survivors.


---

## ALAIS:
There are pictures.

---

She was prettier than you.


---

## ELEANOR:
Oh much.

---

Her eyes, in certain light, were violet and all her teeth were even.

---

That’s a rare feature, even teeth.

---

She smiled to excess but she chewed with real distinction.


---

## ALAIS:
And you hate her even now.


---

## ELEANOR:
No, but I did.

---

He put her in my place, you see, and that was very hard.

---

Like you, she headed Henry’s table; and that’s my chair.


---

## ALAIS:
And so you had her poisoned.

---

## ELEANOR:
That’s a folk tale.

---

Oh, I prayed for her to drop and sang a little when she did but even Circe had her limits.

---

No, I never poisoned Rosamund.

---

Why aren’t you happy?

---

Henry’s keeping you.

---

You must be cleverer than I am.


---

## ALAIS:
Green becomes you.

---

You must always wear it.

---

## ELEANOR:
Are you dressing me in envy?

---

## ALAIS:
I’ve tried feeling pity for you, but it keeps turning into something else.

---

## ELEANOR:
Why pity?


---

## ALAIS:
You love Henry but you love his kingdom, too.

---

You look at him and you see cities, acreage, coastline, taxes.

---

All I see is Henry.

---

Leave him to me, can’t you?


---

## ELEANOR:
But I left him years ago.

---

## ALAIS:
You are untouchable.

---

And I thought I could move you.

---

Were you always like this?

---

Years ago, when I was young and worshipped you, is this what you were like?


---

## ELEANOR:
Most likely.

---

Child, I’m finished and I’ve come to give him anything he asks for.


---

## ALAIS:
Do you know what I should like for Christmas?

---

I should like to see you suffer.


---

## ELEANOR:
Alias, just for you.


---

## ALAIS:
Maman, oh Maman.

---

## ELEANOR:
The Christmas wine will make you warm –
Don’t shiver, child.

---

## ALAIS:
I’m not.

---

## ELEANOR:
The Christmas logs will glow.
There’s Christmas cheer and comfort here –
Is that you crying?

---

## ALAIS:
Non, Maman.

---

## ELEANOR:
Hold close and never let me go.


---

## HENRY:
The sky is pocked with stars.

---

What eyes the three wise men must have had to spot a new one in so many.


---

## ELEANOR:
You look cold.

---

## ALAIS:
I’ve mulled some wine.

---

## HENRY:
I wonder, were there fewer stars then – I don’t know.
What’s this?

---

## ALAIS:
Warm wine.

---

## HENRY:
Why, so it is.

You are as beautiful as I remembered.
Off to bed.

---

My widow wants to see me.


---

## ALAIS:
Let me stay.

---

## HENRY:
Wait up for me.

---

I won’t be long.

---

## ALAIS:
She came to find out what your plans are.

---

## HENRY:
I know that.

---

## ALAIS:
She wants you back.


---

## HENRY:
Old as I am?

---

## ELEANOR:
Old as you are.


---

## ALAIS:
Oh, eat each other up for all I care.
I’m an orphan and I’ll never have a husband and my lover’s wife has fangs for teeth and everybody’s going to die.

---

We’ve got no Romans and no Christians but the rest of the arena, that we have.


---

## ELEANOR:
I’m rather proud; I taught her all the rhetoric she knows.

---

## HENRY:
So, you want me back.

---

## ELEANOR:
She thinks I do.

---

She thinks the need for loving never stops.


---

## HENRY:
She’s got a point.

---

I marvel at you: after all these years, still like a democratic drawbridge, going down for everybody.


---

## ELEANOR:
At my age, there’s not much traffic anymore.


---

## HENRY:
To your interminable health.
Well, wife, what’s on your mind?

---

## ELEANOR:
Oh, Henry, we have made a mess of it.

---

## HENRY:
Yes, haven’t we.

---

## ELEANOR:
Could we have done it worse?

---

## HENRY:
You look like Doomsday.

---

## ELEANOR:
Late nights do that to me.

---

Am I puffy?


---

## HENRY:
Possibly: it’s hard to tell; there’s all that natural sag.


---

## ELEANOR:
I’ve just seen Richard.

---

## HENRY:
He says you fought.

---

## HENRY:
We always do.

---

## ELEANOR:
It’s his impression that you plan to disinherit all of them.

---

## HENRY:
I fancy I’ll relent.

---

Don’t you?

---

## ELEANOR:
I don’t much care.

---

In fact, I wonder, Henry, if I care for anything.

---

I wonder if I’m hungry out of habit and if all my lusts, like passions in a poem, aren’t really recollections.


---

## HENRY:
I could listen to you lie for hours.

---

So your lust is rusty.

---

Gorgeous.

---

## ELEANOR:
I’m so tired, Henry.


---

## HENRY:
Sleep, then.

---

Sleep and dream of me with croutons.

---

Henri a la mode de Caen.


---

## ELEANOR:
Henry, stop it.

---

## HENRY:
Eleanor, I haven’t started.

---

## ELEANOR:
What is it you want?

---

You want the day?

---

You’ve carried it.

---

It’s yours.

---

I’m yours.


---

## HENRY:
My what?

---

You are my what?

---

## ELEANOR:
Your anything at all.

---

You want my name on paper?

---

I’ll sign anything.

---

You want the Aquitaine for John?

---

It’s John’s.

---

It’s his, it’s yours, it’s anybody’s.

---

Take it.


---

## HENRY:
In exchange for what?


---

## ELEANOR:
For nothing, for a little quiet, for an end to this, for God’s sake sail me back to England, lock me up and lose the key and let me be alone.

---


You have my oath.

---

I give my word.
Oh.

---

Well.

---

Well, well…


---

## HENRY:
Would you like a pillow?

---

Footstool?

---

What about a shawl?
Your oaths are profanities.

---

Your word’s a curse.

---

Your name on paper is a waste of pulp.

---

I’m vilifying you, for God’s sake.

---

Pay attention.
Eleanor!
Don’t do that.

---

## ELEANOR:
Like any thinking person, I should like to think there was – I don’t care whose or which – some God.

---

Not out of fear: death is a lark; it’s life that stings.

---

But if there were some God, then I’d exist in his imagination.

---

I’d have no contradictions, no confusions, no waste parts, or misplaced elements and then, oh, Henry, then I’d make some sense.

---

I’d be a Queen in Arcady and not an animal in chaos.

---

How, from where we started, did we reach this Christmas?


---

## HENRY:
Step by step.

---

## ELEANOR:
What happens to me now?

---

## HENRY:
That’s lively curiosity from such a dead cat.

---

If you want to know my plans, just ask me.


---

## ELEANOR:
Conquer China, sack the Vatican or take the veil; I’m not among the ones who give a damn.

---

Just let me sign my lands to John and go to bed.


---

## HENRY:
No, you’re too kind.

---

I can’t accept.


---

## ELEANOR:
Oh, come on, man.

---

I’ll sign the thing in blood or spit or bright blue ink.

---

Let’s have it done.


---

## HENRY:
Let’s not.

---

No, I don’t think I want your signature on anything.

---

## ELEANOR:
You don’t?

---

## HENRY:
Dear God, the pleasure I still get from goading you.


---

## ELEANOR:
You don’t want John to have my provinces?

---

## HENRY:
Bull’s eye.

---

## ELEANOR:
I can’t bear you when you’re smug.

---

## HENRY:
I know, I know.


---

## ELEANOR:
You don’t want Richard and you don’t want John.

---

## HENRY:
You’ve grasped it.

---

## ELEANOR:
All right.

---

Be truthful for once.

---

What do you want?

---

## HENRY:
A new wife.

---

## ELEANOR:
Oh.

---

## HENRY:
Aesthete and poetaster that you are, you worship beauty and simplicity.

---

I worship with you.

---

Down with all that’s ugly and complex, like frogs or pestilence or our relationship.

---

I ask you, what’s more beautiful and simple than a new wife?


---

## ELEANOR:
So, I’m to be annulled.

---

Well, will the Pope annul me, do you think?


---

## HENRY:
The Pontif owes me one Pontificate; I think he will.

---

## ELEANOR:
Out Eleanor, in Alais.

---

Why?

---

## HENRY:
Why?

---

A new wife, wife, will bear me sons.


---

## ELEANOR:
That is the single thing of which I should have thought you had enough.

---

## HENRY:
I want a son.

---

## ELEANOR:
Whatever for?

---

Why, we could populate a country town with girls who’ve born you sons.

---

How many is it?

---

Help me count the bastards.


---

## HENRY:
All my sons are bastards.

---

## ELEANOR:
You really mean to do it.


---

## HENRY:
Lady love, with all my heart.

---

## ELEANOR:
Your sons are part of you.

---

## HENRY:
Like warts and goiters – and I’m having them removed.


---

## ELEANOR:
We made them.

---

They’re our boys.


---

## HENRY:
I know.

---

And good God, look at them.

---

Young Henry: vain, deceitful, weak and cowardly.

---

The only patriotic thing he ever did was die.


---

## ELEANOR:
I thought you loved him most.

---

## HENRY:
I did.

---

And Geoffrey: there’s a masterpiece.

---

He isn’t flesh: he’s a device; he’s wheels and gears.


---

## ELEANOR:
Well, every family has one.


---

## HENRY:
But not four.

---

Then Johnny.

---

Was his latest treason your idea?


---

## ELEANOR:
John has so few ideas; no, I can’t bring myself to claim it.


---

## HENRY:
I have caught him lying and I’ve said he’s young.

---

I’ve seen him cheating and I’ve thought he’s just a boy.

---

I’ve watched him steal and whore and whip his servants and he’s not a child.

---

He’s the man we’ve made him.


---

## ELEANOR:
Don’t share John with me; he’s your accomplishment.


---

## HENRY:
And Richard’s yours.

---

How could you send him off to deal with Philip?


---

## ELEANOR:
I was tired.

---

I was busy.

---

They were friends.


---

## HENRY:
Eleanor, he was the best.

---

The strongest, bravest, handsomest and from the cradle one you cradled him.

---

I never had a chance.


---

## ELEANOR:
You never wanted one.

---

## HENRY:
How do you know?

---

You took him.

---

Separation from your husband you could bear.

---

But not your boy.


---

## ELEANOR:
Whatever I have done, you made me do.


---

## HENRY:
You threw me out of bed for Richard.


---

## ELEANOR:
Not until you threw me out for Rosamund.


---

## HENRY:
It’s not that simple.

---

I won’t have it be that simple.

---

## ELEANOR:
I adored you.

---

## HENRY:
Never.


---

## ELEANOR:
I still do.

---

## HENRY:
Of all the lies, that one is the most terrible.


---

## ELEANOR:
I know: that’s why I saved it up for now.
Oh, Henry, we have mangled everything we’ve touched.


---

## HENRY:
Deny us what you will, we have done that.

---

And all for Rosamund.


---

## ELEANOR:
No, you were right: it is too simple.

---

Life, if it’s like anything at all, is like an avalanche.

---

To blame the little ball of snow that starts is all, to say it is the cause, is just as true as it is meaningless.


---

## HENRY:
Do you remember when we met?

---

## ELEANOR:
Down to the hour and the color of your stockings.


---

## HENRY:
I could hardly see you for the sunlight.

---

## ELEANOR:
It was raining but no matter.

---

## HENRY:
There was very little talk as I recall it.

---

## ELEANOR:
Very little.

---

## HENRY:
I had never touched such beauty – and I walked right up and touched it.

---

God, where did I find the gall to do that?


---

## ELEANOR:
In my eyes?


---

## HENRY:
I loved you.

---

## ELEANOR:
No annulment.


---

## HENRY:
What?

---

## ELEANOR:
There will be no annulment.

---

## HENRY:
Will there not?

---

## ELEANOR:
No; I’m afraid you’ll have to do without.

---

## HENRY:
Well… it was just a whim.

---

## ELEANOR:
I’m so relieved.

---

I did not want to lose you.


---

## HENRY:
Out of curiosity, as intellectual to intellectual, how in the name of bleeding Jesus can you lose me?

---

Do you ever see me?

---

Am I ever with you?

---

Ever near you?

---

Am I ever anywhere but somewhere else?


---

## ELEANOR:
I’m not concerned about your geographical location.


---

## HENRY:
Do we write?

---

Do I send messages?

---

Do boats bearing gifts float up the Thames to you?

---

Are you remembered?


---

## ELEANOR:
Can’t you feel the chains?

---

## HENRY:
You know enough to know I can’t be stopped.


---

## ELEANOR:
But I don’t have to stop you; I have only to delay you.

---

Every enemy you have has friends in Rome.

---

We’ll cost you time.


---

## HENRY:
What is this?

---

I’m not moldering; my paint’s not peeling off.

---

I’m good for years.


---

## ELEANOR:
How many years?

---

Suppose I hold you back for one; I can – it’s possible.

---

Suppose your first son dies; ours did – it’s possible.

---

Suppose you’re daughtered next; we were.

---

How old is Daddy then?

---

What kind of spindly, rickets-ridden, milky, semi-witted, wizened, dim-eyed, gammy-handed, limpy line of things will you beget?


---

## HENRY:
It’s sweet of you to care.

---

## ELEANOR:
And when you die, which is regrettable but necessary, what will happen to frail Alais and her pruney prince?

---

You can’t think Richard’s going to wait for your grotesque to grow?


---

## HENRY:
You wouldn’t let him do a thing like that?


---

## ELEANOR:
Let him?

---

I’d push him through the nursery door.

---

## HENRY:
You’re not that cruel.

---

## ELEANOR:
Don’t’ fret.

---

We’ll wait until you are dead to do it.

---

## HENRY:
Eleanor, what do you want?


---

## ELEANOR:
Just what you want: a king for a son.

---

You can make more.

---

I can’t.

---

You think I want to disappear?

---

One sone is all I’ve got, and you can blot him out and call me cruel.

---

For these ten years You’ve lived with everything I’ve lost and loved another woman through it all.

---

And I’m cruel.

---

I could peel you like a pear and God himself would call it justice.


---

## HENRY:
I will die sometime soon.

---

One day I’ll duck too slow and at Westminster, they’ll sing out Vivat Rex for someone else.

---

I beg you, let it be a son of mine.


---

## ELEANOR:
I am not moved to tears.

---

## HENRY:
I have no sons.

---

## ELEANOR:
You’ve got too many sons.

---

You don’t need more.

---

## HENRY:
Well, wish me luck.

---

I’m off.

---

## ELEANOR:
To Rome?


---

## HENRY:
That’s where they keep the Pope.

---

## ELEANOR:
You don’t dare go.

---

## HENRY:
Say that again at noon, you’ll say it to my horse’s arse.

---

Lamb, I’ll be rid of you by Easter: you can count your reign in days.


---

## ELEANOR:
If you go to Rome, we’ll rise against you.

---

## HENRY:
Who will?

---

## ELEANOR:
Richard, Geoffrey, John, and Eleanor of Aquitaine.


---

## HENRY:
The day those stout hearts band together is the day that pigs get wings.


---

## ELEANOR:
There’ll be pork in the treetops come morning.

---

Don’t you see?

---

You’ve given them a common cause: new sons.

---

You leave the country, and you’ve lost it.


---

## HENRY:
All of you at once.

---

## ELEANOR:
And Philip, too.

---

He’d join us.

---

## HENRY:
Yes, he would.

---

## ELEANOR:
Now how’s your trip to Rome?

---

## HENRY:
You’d truly do this to me?

---

## ELEANOR:
Oh, I’ve got you, got you, got you.


---

## HENRY:
Should I take a thousand men-at-arms to Rome or is that showy?

---

## ELEANOR:
Bluff away.

---

I love it.


---

## HENRY:
Ah, poor thing.

---

How can I break the news?

---

You’ve just miscalculated.

---

## ELEANOR:
Have I?

---

How?

---

## HENRY:
You should have lied to me.

---

You should have promised to be good while I was gone.

---

I would have let your three boys loose.

---

They could have fought me then.


---

## ELEANOR:
You wouldn’t keep your sons locked up here?

---

## HENRY:
Why the devil wouldn’t I?

---

## ELEANOR:
You don’t dare.

---

## HENRY:
Why not?

---

What’s to stop me?

---

Let them sit in Chinon for a while.

---

## ELEANOR:
No; I forbid it!


---

## HENRY:
She forbids it!

---

## ELEANOR:
Did your father sleep with me, or didn’t he?


---

## HENRY:
No doubt you’re going to tell me that he did.

---

## ELEANOR:
Would it upset you?

---

## HENRY:
What about the thousand men?

---

I say be gaudy and to hell with it.


---

## ELEANOR:
Don’t leave me, Henry.

---

I’m at rock bottom, I’ll do anything to keep you.

---

## HENRY:
I think you think you mean it.

---

## ELEANOR:
Ask for something.


---

## HENRY:
Eleanor, we’re past it; years past.

---

## ELEANOR:
Test me.

---

Name an act.

---

## HENRY:
There isn’t one.

---

## ELEANOR:
About my fornication with your father –

---

## HENRY:
Yes, there is.

---

You can expire.

---

## ELEANOR:
You first old man.

---

I only hope I’m there to watch.

---

You’re so afraid of dying.

---

You’re so scared of it.


---

## HENRY:
Poor Eleanor; if only she had lied.

---

## ELEANOR:
She did.

---

She said she never loved your father.


---

## HENRY:
I can always count on you.

---

## ELEANOR:
I’ve never touched you without thinking, “Geoffrey, Geoffrey.

---

”

---

## HENRY:
When you hurt me, I’ll cry out.

---

## ELEANOR:
I’ve put more horns on you than Louis ever wore.

---

## HENRY:
Am I supposed to care?

---

## ELEANOR:
I’ll kill you if you leave me.

---

## HENRY:
You can try.

---

## ELEANOR:
I loved your father’s body.

---

He was beautiful.


---

## HENRY:
It never happened.

---

## ELEANOR:
I can see his body now.

---

Shall I describe it?

---

## HENRY:
Eleanor, I hope you die.

---

## ELEANOR:
His arms were rough, with scars here –

---

## HENRY:
Stop it!

---

## ELEANOR:
I can feel his arms.

---

I feel them.

---

## HENRY:
AAH!

---

## ELEANOR:
What’s that?

---

Have I hurt you?


---

## HENRY:
Oh my God, I’m going to be sick.

---

## ELEANOR:
We did it.

---

You were in the next room when he did it.
Well, what family doesn’t have its ups and downs.?
It’s cold.

---

I can’t feel anything.
Nothing at all.
We couldn’t go back, could we, Henry?

---

## PHILIP:
How much do I love winning.

---

I watched in amusement as Henry and his boorish brood fought amongst themselves.


---

## ALAIS:
Do you really think that you can come to Chinon and miraculously win?

---

You underestimate Henry.

---

Or perhaps you overestimate your abilities?


---

## PHILIP:
You say that to your King?

---

I thought that Eleanor would have taught you better manners.

---

It’s obvious I have the day; the French king against the English king and the French king won.
That is something your father never could do.


---

## ALAIS:
Then I accept your assessment.

---

You sir, are the victor.

---

So why are you here?


---

## PHILIP:
Something is missing.

---

What I thought was so sweet does not linger long on the tongue.

---

I don’t think Henry knows that I won.

---

How good is victory if you can’t see it in your enemy’s face?

---

I have to deliver a coup de grace.

---

I will remove the prize.

---

I will tell Henry that you will leave with me.

---

Today.

---

No Alais for his Richard or for his John or for his bed.

---

And the pain it will cause him will be my pleasure.
Come.

---

## ALAIS:
No.

---

## PHILIP:
No?

---

## ALAIS:
I’m not leaving.

---

You said you already were the victor.

---

Is that not enough?

---

## PHILIP:
I order you.


---

## ALAIS:
You order me?

---

It’s been how long since you’ve seen me?

---

If I wasn’t useful, you would not even remember my name.


---

## PHILIP:
Stop this.

---

You will do as I command.


---

## ALAIS:
You rant and bellow exactly like Henry.

---

You’re just not as good at it as he is.

---

## PHILIP:
Don’t you dare.

---

You insolent…

---

## ALAIS:
Is this what you have become?

---

Go on – take out your anger on me.

---

Isn’t that what I’m for?

---

You are my King, yet I held you when you were swaddled.

---

I used to pretend that you were my child.

---

I rocked you, so beautiful and sweet.

---

Tell me when a boy is crowned a King does he always lose himself and become as brutal as a feral dog?


---

## PHILIP:
It’s a necessary tool when fighting feral dogs.

---

A skill I was taught.


---

## ALAIS:
Louis wasn’t like that.

---

## PHILIP:
Our father was helpless.

---

But I had many teachers.

---

My time with Richard was well spent.

---

There’s a man who will destroy a village just because he is bored.

---

How do you expect me to behave?

---

Should I ask Henry out for a friendly game of jeu de mail?

---

We are Kings.

---

Our games have larger boundaries.


---

## ALAIS:
You are both so alike.

---

Am I doomed to love and hate you both equally?

---

You both keep me prisoner.

---

Yes, I can move about but I’m just like Eleanor – confined by the heart.


---

## PHILIP:
Eleanor’s in prison because she tried to kill Henry not because she loved him.


---

## ALAIS:
Your age is showing my young lord.

---

Love is the turnkey.

---

Eleanor loves Henry, Henry loves me, I love Henry.

---

Henry loves Eleanor.

---

Richard, Geoffrey, and John love power.

---

This is the story the chroniclers will tell.

---

No go.

---

Go back to France without me.

---

Do not ignite a war.

---

Let their family destroy from within.


---

## PHILIP:
Am I to take advice from you?

---

## ALAIS:
My advice is pure and shouldn’t be dismissed.

---

I’ve watched the wanton bloodshed of this holiday.

---

Dear brother, I do not want you to be drowned in a conflict that you cannot win.

---

Leave as you first planned and enjoy their destruction from afar.


---

## PHILIP:
And have Henry think I’m weak?

---

## ALAIS:
Time is your friend, my youthful King.

---

They will tear each other apart like peasants fighting over a scrap and you will win without a single blow.

---

But believe me they will join together if they perceive a threat from elsewhere.


---

## PHILIP:
You have learned more from Eleanor than you know.


---

## HENRY:
Get up, wake up, it’s morning.

---

## ALAIS:
Henry?

---

What’s wrong?

---

## HENRY:
We’re packing up and moving out.

---

## ALAIS:
Is there a war?

---

What happened?

---

## HENRY:
Merry Christmas.

---

## ALAIS:
Henry, what’s the matter?


---

## HENRY:
Nothing, for a change; would you believe it?

---

## ALAIS:
Where’ve you been all night?

---

## HENRY:
You know what a mesnie is?

---

It’s a train, an entourage.

---

It’s made of soldiers, cooks and clerics, wagons, barrows, linen, treasure, chickens, butts of wine, and spices.

---

I’ve been all night making one.


---

## ALAIS:
What for?

---

## HENRY:
We’re off to Rome to see the Pope.

---

## ALAIS:
He’s excommunicated you again.

---

## HENRY:
He’s going to set me free.

---

I’m having Eleanor annulled.

---

The nation will be shocked to learn our marriage wasn’t consummated.


---

## ALAIS:
What happened last night when I left?

---

## HENRY:
We hugged and kissed a little.

---

## ALAIS:
Oh, be serious.

---

## HENRY:
And then, I told her you and I were getting married.

---

## ALAIS:
Are we?

---

## HENRY:
By the Pope himself.

---

## ALAIS:
You mean it?

---

## HENRY:
Shall I kneel?


---

## ALAIS:
It’s not another trick?

---

## HENRY:
The bridal party’s drilling on the cobblestones.

---

## ALAIS:
She loves you, Henry.

---

## HENRY:
See for yourself.

---

## ALAIS:
She’ll find a way to stop us.

---

## HENRY:
How?

---

She won’t be here.

---

We’re launching her for Salisbury Tower when she winds change.

---

She’ll be barging down the River Vienne by lunchtime.


---

## ALAIS:
If she doesn’t stop us, Richard will.

---

## HENRY:
Suppose I do the worrying.


---

## ALAIS:
He won’t like losing me.

---

## HENRY:
He’s lost a damn sight more than you.

---

I’ve corked him up.

---

## ALAIS:
You’ve what?

---

## HENRY:
He’s in the cellar with his brothers and the wine.

---

The royal boys are aging with the royal port.

---

You haven’t said “yes.

---

” Would you like a formal declaration?
There – my finest angle; it’s on all the coins.

---

Sad Alais, will you marry me?

---

## ALAIS:
I can’t believe it.

---

## HENRY:
Be my Queen.

---

## ALAIS:
I never hoped for this.

---

I mean, I always hoped but never thought – I mean –


---

## HENRY:
We’ll love each other and you’ll give me sons.

---

## ALAIS:
I don’t know what I mean.

---

## HENRY:
Let’s have five; we’ll do Eleanor one better.

---

Why, I’ll even call the first one Louis if you like.

---

Louis le Premier: how’s that for a King of England?


---

## ALAIS:
Henry, - you can’t ever let them out.

---

## HENRY:
You’ve lost me.

---

Let who out?

---

## ALAIS:
Your sons?

---

You’ve put them in the dungeon, and you’ve got to keep them there forever.


---

## HENRY:
Do I now?


---

## ALAIS:
If they’re free when you die, it’s the dungeon or the nunnery for me.

---

I don’t care which – a cell’s a cell – but, Henry, what about the child?


---

## HENRY:
Don’t bother me with the child.

---

The damn thing isn’t born yet.


---

## ALAIS:
If they’re free, they’ll kill it.

---

I’m the one who’ll live to see that, and I will not see our children murdered.


---

## HENRY:
You don’t make the ultimatums: I do.


---

## ALAIS:
Not this time.

---

Either you keep them down forever or you find yourself another widow.

---

I don’t want the job.


---

## HENRY:
Do you know what you’re asking me to do?

---

## ALAIS:
You locked your Queen up.


---

## HENRY:
But my boys – how can I?

---

## ALAIS:
That’s for you to face.

---

## HENRY:
But they’re my sons.

---

## ALAIS:
I hate your sons.

---

I’m not the one who wants a new line.

---

If you want it, that’s the price.


---

## HENRY:
You’ll come to Rome if I say so.

---

You’ll marry me if I say so.

---

The boys go free if I say so.

---

My terms are the only terms.

---

The difficulty is, you see, the difficulty is you’re right.
Incredible, but I have children who would murder children.

---

Every time I’ve read Medea I’ve thought: “No; the thing’s absurd.

---

Fish eat their young, and foxes: but not us.

---

” And yet she did it.

---

I imagine she was mad; don’t you?
Ys, mad she must have been.

---

## ALAIS:
Henry – are you going down?


---

## HENRY:
Down?

---

Yes.

---

## ALAIS:
To let them out or to keep them in?


---

## HENRY:
Could you say, to a child of yours, “You’ve seen the sunlight for the last time?”


---

## ALAIS:
Can you do it, Henry?

---

## HENRY:
Well, I’d be a master bastard if I did.

---

## ALAIS:
I must know.

---

Can you?

---

## HENRY:
I shall have to, shan’t I?


---

## JOHN:
The trick is not to dribble when you hang the bung.
Voila.

---

I had an alcoholic Latin tutor – cup.
- who taught me all he knew.

---

## GEOFFREY:
Which wasn’t much.

---

## JOHN:
I know I might as well be drunk.

---

## GEOFFREY:
If I were you, I’d be worried.


---

## JOHN:
You know me – cup.
I’d just worry over all the wrong things.


---

## GEOFFREY:
Don’t you know what’s going to happen?


---

## JOHN:
No, and you don’t either.

---

You and your big cerebellum.
“I’m what’s left.

---

Here, Daddy; here I am.” And here you are.

---

## RICHARD:
But not for long.

---

## GEOFFREY:
You think we’re getting out?

---

## RICHARD:
No; deeper in.

---

The fortress at Vaudreuil has dungeons down two-hundred feet.

---

That’s where I’d keep us.


---

## GEOFFREY:
And if I were Father, I’m not sure I’d keep the three of us at all.

---

You don’t take prisoners; no, you don’t.

---

And with good reason.

---

Dungeon doors can swing both ways, but coffins have no hinges.


---

## JOHN:
I know you.

---

You only want to frighten me.


---

## GEOFFREY:
John, the condition of your trousers, be they wet or dry, could not concern me less.

---

I think I’m apt to die today and I am sweating, John.

---

I’m sweating cold.


---

## JOHN:
We’ve got friends.

---

## GEOFFREY:
Name one.

---

## JOHN:
Someone’s got to rescue us.

---

## GEOFFREY:
I can’t think who or how or why.


---

## RICHARD:
He isn’t going to see me beg.

---

He’ll get no satisfaction out of me.


---

## GEOFFREY:
Why, you chivalric fool – as if the way one fell down mattered.


---

## RICHARD:
When the fall is all there is, it matters.

---

## JOHN:
Can’t we run or hide or anything?

---

## RICHARD:
Just in the wine.

---

## JOHN:
Geoff –


---

## ELEANOR:
My barge is leaving at eleven and I’ve come to say goodbye.


---

## GEOFFREY:
Does Henry know you’re here?

---

## ELEANOR:
The Queen still has some privileges.

---

I bring you breakfast.

---

## JOHN:
I’m not hungry.

---

## GEOFFREY:
What’s he planning?

---

## RICHARD:
Is he going to keep us here?

---

## ELEANOR:
First, have a little nourishment.

---

## RICHARD:
For God’s sake, Mother –


---

## ELEANOR:
Eat.


---

## GEOFFREY:
Well, Eleanor.

---

## RICHARD:
How heavy is the outside guard?

---

## ELEANOR:
There is just the turnkey.

---

## RICHARD:
What about the courtyard and the gates?


---

## ELEANOR:
They’re putting Henry’s train together and its chaos.

---

You can walk right out.


---

## RICHARD:
We’ll go to Poitiers.

---

He’ll expect that but we’ll meet him with an army when he comes.
Keep close to me and when you run, run hard.


---

## GEOFFREY:
Why run at all?

---

I think we ought to stay.

---

## JOHN:
Stay here?

---

## GEOFFREY:
Till Henry comes.

He will come, won’t he – and he’ll come alone.
I count three knives to one.

---

## RICHARD:
You think we could?

---

## JOHN:
I’d only do it wrong.

---

You kill him and I’ll watch.


---

## GEOFFREY:
The three of us together: we must all three do it.

---

I want us all to be responsible.


---

## ELEANOR:
Don’t listen to him.

---

Take the knives and run.

---

## GEOFFREY:
And miss this opportunity?

---

## ELEANOR:
Get out.

---

## GEOFFREY:
I’ll be behind him with John.

---

You’ll want’ to do it from the front.
And you, you lucky girl, you get to see the pageant.


---

## ELEANOR:
Mother’s looking for a name for you – if English has one adequately foul.


---

## GEOFFREY:
Now hold on.

---

I’ve been vilified enough.

---

I’ve had enough of it.

---

You brought the cutlery; you hauled it down here.

---

Don’t you dare tell me this wasn’t in your mind.


---

## ELEANOR:
I tell you.

---

I deny it.

---

## GEOFFREY:
Swear on something.

---

I’m agog to hear what you consider holy.

---

## RICHARD:
Where are you going?

---

## ELEANOR:
Up for air.

---

## GEOFFREY:
Don’t stop her.

---

## RICHARD:
But she’ll warn him.


---

## GEOFFREY:
Let her go.

---

She isn’t going to tell him anything.


---

## ELEANOR:
You think I’m going to let this happen.


---

## GEOFFREY:
Frankly, Mother, your position on the council is poorish.

---

If you tattled, there would be a rash of executions and you don’t want that.

---

No, you don’t want to lose a single one of us: not even me.


---

## ELEANOR:
You’re clever but I wonder if you’re right.


---

## GEOFFREY:
Oh, lady, don’t you know where you are?

---

You’re in stalemate.

---

Warn him, it’s the end of us: warn him not and it’s the end of him.

---

It’s that clear.


---

## ELEANOR:
Guard.

---

## GEOFFREY:
Go on, dear.

---

Call again – and pitch it up a little.


---

## ELEANOR:
I’ll have him take the knives away.


---

## RICHARD:
And be the one to put us in Vaudreuil?


---

## ELEANOR:
Then run away, escape.

---

You’ve still got time.

---

## RICHARD:
No.

---

Geoffrey’s right: we’ll stay.

---

## ELEANOR:
You too?

---

Oh, Richard.

---

## RICHARD:
Oh, oh, oh.

---

There’s nothing in your Oh’s: they’re empty.

---

## ELEANOR:
You’re not an assassin.

---

## RICHARD:
Look again.


---

## ELEANOR:
You’re not.

---

You’re my Richard and you love me.


---

## RICHARD:
Let me kiss the nasty scratch and make it well.

---

## ELEANOR:
Yes, do.

---

Come, let me hold you.

---

## RICHARD:
You’re more beautiful than ever.

---

There is much that’s beautiful in evil when it’s absolutely pure.

---

You are so foul, you’re fair.

---

You stand there looking like a saint in pain when you brought us the knives to do your work.


---

## ELEANOR:
That’s not true.

---

## RICHARD:
You did bring these things.

---

## ELEANOR:
Not for this.

---

## RICHARD:
Here – you want him dead, you do it.


---

## ELEANOR:
You unnatural animal.

---

## RICHARD:
Unnatural, Mummy?

---

You tell me, what’s nature’s way?

---

If poisoned mushrooms grow and babies come with crooked backs, if dogs go mad and wives kill husbands, what’s unnatural?

---

Here stands your lamb.

---

Come cover him with kisses; he’s all yours.


---

## ELEANOR:
No, you’re not mine.

---

I’m not responsible.


---

## RICHARD:
Where do you think I learned this from?

---

How old was I when you fought with Henry first?


---

## ELEANOR:
Young…!

---

I don’t know.

---

## RICHARD:
How many battles did I watch?

---

## ELEANOR:
But those were battles, not a knife behind a door.


---

## RICHARD:
I’ve never heard a corpse ask how it got so cold.

---

You’ve a mind: you tell me, what was on it when you had your soldiers point their crossbows at him?


---

## ELEANOR:
That was in the field.

---

## RICHARD:
I don’t care if it was in the dahlia bed.

---

What were you thinking, Eleanor?

---

## ELEANOR:
Of you.

---

## RICHARD:
Of your unnatural animal?

---

## ELEANOR:
I did it all for you.

---

## RICHARD:
You wanted Father dead.

---

## ELEANOR:
No, never that.


---

## RICHARD:
You tried to kill him, didn’t you?

---

## ELEANOR:
Yes.

---

## RICHARD:
Why?

---

What did you want?

---

## ELEANOR:
I wanted Henry back.

---

## RICHARD:
You lie.

---

## ELEANOR:
I wanted Henry.

---

Isn’t there a chair?


---

## JOHN:
Here.


None of that.

---

## ELEANOR:
I’ve done without it this long; I’ll endure.


---

## GEOFFREY:
She’ll warn him.

---

I was wrong.

---

She’ll do it fi she gets the chance.

---

## ELEANOR:
Then you’re in a stalemate; aren’t you lamb?

---

## GEOFFREY:
How so?

---

## ELEANOR:
You don’t dare let me stay here and you don’t dare let me out.

---

Dear me, whatever shall we do with Mother?


---

## GEOFFREY:
Offhand there are several possibilities.

---

## JOHN:
Watch it.


---

## HENRY:
It wants light.

---

What we do in dungeons needs the shades of day.

---

I stole the candles from the chapel.

---

No one minded.

---

Jesus won’t begrudge them, and the chaplain works for me.

---

## ELEANOR:
You look dreadful.

---

## HENRY:
So do you.

---

## ELEANOR:
I under slept a little.

---

## HENRY:
We can all rest in a little while.

---

That’s better.

---

Bright and clear, just like the morning.


---

## ELEANOR:
Here.

---

I’ll take the breakfast things.


---

## RICHARD:
Not yet.

---

## ELEANOR:
They’ve gone cold.

---

## RICHARD:
They’re good cold.

---

## HENRY:
Listen to me.

---

What’s the answer.

---

Can I ever let you out?


---

## RICHARD:
What do you want from us?

---

You must be mad.

---

Damn you.

---

Why did you have to come here?

---

## HENRY:
You think I want to lock you up?

---

## RICHARD:
You’ve got to.

---

You can’t let me out.

---

You know you can’t.

---

I’ll never stop.

---

## HENRY:
I can’t stop either.


---

## RICHARD:
There’s only fighting left.

---

## HENRY:
Not even that.

---

What have you got to fight me with?


---

## ELEANOR:
My children.

---

In the past, I’ve come and gone and loved you when it suited me.

---

I never nursed you, weaned you, washed you, fed you, but today I felt such love for each of you and so I brought you breakfast.


---

## RICHARD:
Mother.

---

## HENRY:
Let her be.

---

## ELEANOR:
I thought I had no other choice, but I was wrong again.


---

## HENRY:
Bravo boys: that’s what I have.

---

Three warriors.

---

Who had first crack?

---

How was I divided up?

---

Christ –


---

## RICHARD:
You drove us to it.

---

## HENRY:
Don’t stop now.

---

You’re killers, aren’t you?

---

I am.

---

I can do it.
Take a knife.
Come on.

---

What is it?

---

Come for me.

---

## RICHARD:
I can’t.

---

## HENRY:
You’re Richard, aren’t you?

---

## RICHARD:
But you’re Henry.


---

## HENRY:
Please.

---

We can’t stop and we can’t go back.

---

There’s nothing else.


---

## JOHN:
Daddy?

---

Take me back.

---

Please.

---

Can’t we try again?

---

## HENRY:
Again?

---

## JOHN:
We always have before.

---

## HENRY:
Oh yes…we always have.

---

## JOHN:
Oh, Daddy.

---

## ELEANOR:
Go on.

---

Execute them.

---

You’re the King.

---

You’ve judged.

---

You’ve sentenced.

---

You know how.


---

## HENRY:
By God, I will.

---

Come Monday and they’ll hang you with the washing.

---

There’ll be princes swinging from the Christmas trees.


---

## ELEANOR:
Why wait?

---

They are assassins, aren’t they?

---

This was treason, wasn’t it?

---

You gave them life, you take it.


---

## HENRY:
Who’s to say it’s monstrous?

---

I’m the King.

---

I call it just.

---

Therefore, I Henry, by the Grace of God King of the English, Lord of Scotland, Ireland and Wales, Count of Anjou, Brittany, Poitou and Normandy, Maine, Gascony, and Aquitaine, do sentence you to death.

---

Done this Christmas Day in Chinon in God’s year eleven eighty-three.
Surely that’s not what I intended.

---

Children…Children are…They’re all we have.
Go on.

---

I’m done.

---

I’m done.

---

I’m finished with you.

---

Never come again.


---

## JOHN:
Aren’t you coming?

---

Father has forgiven us.

---

Hasn’t he Mother?

---

All is well again.


---

## GEOFFREY:
No, he has not.

---

He releases his prey just to have the joy of hunting them again.


---

## RICHARD:
Geoffrey is right.

---

Father, Mother, the matter of Alais and the Vexin are still at hand.

---

Therefore I, Richard the Lionheart, Duke of Normandy, Duke of Gascony, Lord of Cyprus, Count of Anjou, Count of Maine, Count of Nantes, and Overlord of Aquitaine; consider this just a postponement.


---

## ELEANOR:
You spare the rod, you’ll spoil those boys.

---

## HENRY:
I couldn’t do it, Eleanor.

---

## ELEANOR:
Nobody thought you could.


---

## HENRY:
I did.

---

## ALAIS:
You saved them.

---

You maneuvered it.

---

## ELEANOR:
Did I?

---

## ALAIS:
They’re free because of you.

---

They’ll kill him one day; you know that.

---

## ELEANOR:
The next time or the next.

---

## ALAIS:
You always win, Maman.

---

## ELEANOR:
Except the prize.

---

## ALAIS:
Come rest.


---

## HENRY:
I want no women in my life.

---

## ALAIS:
You’re tired.

---

## HENRY:
I could have conquered Europe, all of it, but I had women in my life.

---

## ALAIS:
I’ll warm some wine.

---

## HENRY:
I’ve shot your world and there you stand, all honey and molasses.

---

Sweet?

---

You make my teeth ache.


---

## ELEANOR:
That’s touching.

---

Is it for my benefit?

---

## HENRY:
Your benefit?
Get out.

---

Go on.

---

Go.

When you want me, I’ll be waiting.
---

## ALAIS:

---

## HENRY:
I should have killed you years ago.


---

## ELEANOR:
There’s no one peeking.

---

Do it now.


---

## HENRY:
I’ve wasted fortunes, squandered lives, spent everything – to but this pit.

---

I’ve got an eye for value.

---

This is what I’ve made.

---

I meant to do so much.


---

## ELEANOR:
Is this a play for pity?

---

## HENRY:
Not from you.

---

You put me here.

---

You made me do mad things.

---

You’ve bled me.


---

## ELEANOR:
Shoulder it yourself.

---

Don’t put it on my back.

---

You’ve done what you have done and no one but yourself has made you do it.

---

Pick it up and carry it.

---

I can.

---

My losses are my work.


---

## HENRY:
What losses?

---

I’ve been cheated, not you.

---

I’m the one with nothing.


---

## ELEANOR:
Lost your life’s work, have you?

---

Provinces are nothing: land is dirt: I’ve lost you.

---

I can’t ever have you back again.

---

You haven’t suffered.

---

I could take defeats like yours and laugh.

---

I’ve done it.

---

If you’re broken it’s because you’re brittle.

---

You are all that I have ever loved.

---

Christ, you don’t know what nothing is.

---

I want to die.


---

## HENRY:
You don’t.

---

## ELEANOR:
I want to die.

---

## HENRY:
I’ll hold you.

---

## ELEANOR:
I want to die.

---

## HENRY:
Stop saying that.

---

Let me do something, damn you.

---

This is terrible.


---

## ELEANOR:
Henry, I want to die.

---

## HENRY:
You will, you know.

---

Wait long enough and it’ll happen.

---

## ELEANOR:
So it will.

---

## HENRY:
We’re in the cellar and you’re going back to prison and my life is wasted and we’ve lost each other and you’re smiling.


---

## ELEANOR:
It’s the way I register despair.

---

We’re jungle creatures, Henry, and the dark is all around us.

---

See them?

---

In the corners, you can see the eyes.


---

## HENRY:
And they can see ours.

---

I’m a match for anything.

---

Aren’t you?


---

## ELEANOR:
I should have been a great fool not to love you.


---

## HENRY:
Come along; I’ll see you to your ship.

---

## ELEANOR:
So soon?

---

## HENRY:
There’s always Easter Court.

---

## ELEANOR:
You’ll let me out for Easter?

---

## HENRY:
Come the resurrection, you can strike me down again.

---

## ELEANOR:
Perhaps I’ll do it next time.

---

## HENRY:
And perhaps you won’t.

---

## ELEANOR:
It must be late, and I don’t want to miss the tide.


---

## HENRY:
You know, I hope we never die.

---

## ELEANOR:
I hope so, too.

---

## HENRY:
You think there’s any chance of it?
