With a hand-lettered sign above the door.

"Beneath our hats, we are all the same."

[laughter]

---

It was painted by Mr Garbleton,
and he should know.

---

His shop has been furnishing
heads with hats since 1834.

---

That’s 31 years,
for those who’d rather not do the maths.

---

One of those heads belonged
to Mr Charles Dickens,

whose head has filled
the world with stories.

David Copperfield.

Great Expectations.

A Tale of Two Cities.

As you can see, Mr Garbleton’s Shop.

---

[bell rings]

---

Ahem.

---

Oh, sorry, Mrs. Prattle.

---

Since last Thursday,
Garbleton AND Prattle.

---

[bell rings]

---

Quality head wear for men and women.

---

As you can see, it’s a cozy establishment.

---

As though it has recently been expanded.

---

With shelves running
all the way to the ceiling.

---

Black and white tiles across the floor.

---

Mahogany panels upon the walls.

---

And gas lamps casting a rosy glow.

---

The countertop is made of marble.

---

[knocking]

---

As you can see.

---

And upon it rests an enormous
golden cash register.

---

It’s not real gold.

---

Yes, it is.

---

No, it’s not.

---

It could be gold.

---

It’s paint.

---

[chuckling]

---

Still.

---

And here in her ornate cage sits Victoria.

---

[gasping]

---

Oh, no, not Queen Victoria, rather
Mrs Prattle’s beloved Amazon Parrot.

---

[bird sounds]

---

Boasting a bright, green body,
yellowish tint on her back

---

and belly, black beak, gold and yellow
iris, and cerulean throat feathers.

---

[bird sounds]

---

As you can see.

---

Here at Mr Garbleton’s shop, the

---

[bell rings]

---

Sorry, ma'am.

---

It’s, oh, so new.

---

Here at Garbleton and Prattle,
[bell rings]

---

Mr Dickens’ hat

---

occupies a place of honor,

---

looking out upon all the hats of humanity,
which he loves.

---

Blacksmiths and barristers.

---

Orphans and artisans.

---

Seamstresses.

---

Street sweepers.

---

Constables.

---

Schoolteachers.

---

Tinkers.

---

Tailors

---

Soldiers.

---

Sailors.

---

Rich men.

---

Poor men.

---

Beggar men.

---

Thieves.

---

Beneath our hats, we are all the same.

---

And here is where our story begins,

---

in London, December 21st, 1865,

---

the longest night of the year.

---

[wind howling]

---

Ned, be careful with that.

---

Mrs Prattle is hoping to close up early,
so she and

---

Well, you’ll see.

---

How many times have I told
you not to clutch the bonnets?

---

Seven.

---

No, eight.

---

The question was rhetorical.

---

Does that mean the answer is not a number?

---

It means an answer’s not required.

---

There. Now, gently, please.

---

[clock ticking]

---

Where on earth could Lady Plume be?

---

If she were here, ma'am, I could tell you.

---

That question was rhetorical, too.

---

Lettie, my Oh, sorry, Ned.

---

Why are you not dressed yet?

---

I’m trying, but

---

Our train leaves in 45 minutes.

---

The fact is,
my new waistcoat’s lost a button.

---

Impossible.

---

I made it myself.

---

All the same.

---

Don’t move.

---

I’ll stitch it up right where you stand.

---

Ned?

---

Did you feed Victoria?

---

[bird sounds]

---

Yes, ma'am.

---

Feed Victoria.

---

Did you really?

---

Yes, ma'am.

---

Feed Victoria.

---

She seems to think otherwise.

---

I know I did,
because she tried to bite my pinkie off.

---

Don’t be ridiculous, Ned.

---

Victoria’s gentle as a pea hen,
aren’t you, chick, chick?

---

Chick, chick, chick.

---

I can show you the beak mark if you

---

Don’t make up stories.

---

You must’ve forgotten, so feed her now.

---

But, ma'am, I…

---

Go.

---

Feed Victoria.

---

[chatters]

---

Tell Kit to bring up Lady Plume’s hat.

---

You know, I hate to say it, Cabbage,

---

but that boy’s brain
is porous as cheesecloth.

---

You might be a bit more patient with him.

---

It’s hard to be patient
when one is in a rush.

---

It’s when one is in a rush
that one needs patience.

---

You’re right, Cabbage.

---

Of course you’re right,
and I shall strive to be a mother to him.

---

Though the maternal odds
seem not to be native to me.

---

[bird squawks]

---

There’s still time.

---

Did you call a carriage?

---

Well, they’re loading the suitcases.

---

Your new hat?

---

Here, on the counter.

---

Don’t forget it.

---

A hatmaker without a hat would be like

---

an engineer without a pocket protector.

---

Which won’t be invented till 1947.

---

[laughter]

---

There, ready for the altar.

---

[chuckles]

---

What would I do without you, Lettie?

---

One shudders to think.

---

No.

---

[bell rings]

---

Good

---

eventide, ma'am.

---

Don’t mean to startle.

---

The name’s Witslow
of the London Constabulary.

---

I was expecting someone else.

---

Then I shall be brief.

---

I’ve entered the premises
merely to find out

---

whether a crime may be in progress.

---

A crime?

---

Preferably, a felony.

---

[bird squawks]

---

Oh, my.

---

## WIT:
Well, if I may be perfectly frank,
the Chief Inspector

---

## &nbsp;
says it’s not sufficient
to keep the peace no more.

---

## &nbsp;
He wants arrests and convictions.

---

## &nbsp;
Keeps a running tally in his office.

---

## &nbsp;
At present, I’m on the verge of promotion.

---

## &nbsp;
Just one more felony and conviction,
and I’ll be bumped up to Inspector.

---

[chuckles]

---

## MRS PRATTLE:
I’m not a legal expert, but I don’t
think I’ve witnessed any felonies.

---

## WITSLOW:
Murder’s the obvious one of course.

---

Plus high treason, and the four B’s.

---

The four B’s?

---

Burglary, bribery, blasphemy, bigamy.

---

Not to mention, your perjury,
forgery, robbery, housebreaking,

---

assault accompanied by wounding.

---

I certainly hope we shan’t
fall victim to any of those.

---

No one wants to be a victim, ma'am.

---

There’s nefarious persons about,
and we must be vigilant.

---

Then I shall be

---

[squeals]

---

[bird squawks].

---

Vigilant also, Constable,
for your sake as well as the victims’.

---

Much obliged.

---

Now, if you’ll excuse me.

---

[bell rings]

---

Kit, are you there?

---

Kit.

---

Where is that girl?

---

That girl is here

---


---

In the basement of Garbleton.

---

Garbleton and Prattle.

---

Sorry. Garbleton and Prattle.

---


---

Tallying up the days, and weeks,
and months that she must yet work here

---


---

in order to buy her father’s
release from a Queen’s prison.

---

Equals £36.12 No. 15s.

---

He was confined there two years ago.

---

For murder?

---

No.

---

Oh.

---

Larceny by trick?

---

Not that either.

---

Impersonating an officer of the law?

---

Sorry, not a felony.

---

Oh.

---

Kit’s father was imprisoned for debt.

---

Wait, you mean he owed someone money?

---

Yes.

---

Was it a great deal of money?

---

No.

---

Can they do that?

---

They could.

---

Kit was forced to leave school and work

---

for the so-called Debtor’s
Repayment Program.

---

So cold.

---

You’ll see.

---

Equals £31, 16s, and 16p, which is

---

Will you read to me?

---

Hold on, Ned.

---

Which is

---

Will you.

---

Ugh, just a minute.

---

Everyone thinks I’m stupid.

---

You’re not.

---

They think so.

---

Well, then they’re stupid.

---

Are they?

---

Are they, Kit?

---

That’s 11 weeks.

---

Why are you doing maths?

---

That’s less than three months.

---

Are you counting down the days
till you can leave me?

---

Don’t think of it that way, Ned.

---

How can I not?

---

I’m going to get my father out of prison,
and then I can go back to school.

---

You’re clever enough.

---

It’s not about being clever enough.

---

Can you read to me now?

---

I promised your mother I wouldn’t,
not during working hours.

---

She’s not my mother.

---

Stepmother then.

---

Not that either.

---

She will be once they come home tomorrow.

---

Anyway, we should be closed by now.

---

But we’re not.

---

Until we are, I can’t

---

Maybe just a few pages.

---

Great expectations.

---

We just finished, Great Expectations.

---

Can we start over?

---

No.

---

You pick another.

---

Little Dorrit.

---

Oh no, not Little Dorrit again.

---

Why not?

---

I told you, remember.

---

You said that Mr Dickens
boys get to do things

---

whilst his girls only get
to be earnest and pure.

---

See.

---

You are clever.

---

All right, let’s begin a new one,
shall we?

---

Kit are you there?

---

What does she want now?

---

Nothing. Just start.

---

Two pages.

---

Three?

---

All right.

---

See,
this one is called The Personal History

---

and Experience of David Copperfield,
the Younger.

---

That’s a long title.

---

Is it a long story?

---

Yes.

---

Good.

---

Chapter one.

---

I Am Born.

---

I like it already.

---

Shh.

---

Whether I shall turn out
to be the hero of my own life,

---

or whether that station will be held
by anybody else these pages must show.

---

That’s very good.

---

Ned.

---

Sorry.

---

Meanwhile, upstairs.

---

[chuckling]

---

[clanging]

---

Lady Plume at last.

---

[bell rings]

---

Good evening, Montague.

---

I was beginning to wonder
whether Is everything all right?

---

My dear Mrs Prattle, I’m simply astounded.

---

One might say flabbergasted.

---

Oh my.

---

Even thrown from the bone.

---

Is that an expression?

---

It should be.

---

What you have done
in combining Garbleton’s shop

---

with your own might render
a patron apoplectic.

---

I hope in a good way.

---

Is there a good kind of apoplexy?

---

Perhaps not.

---

I very much doubt it.

---

What in the name of fashion
could have compelled you

---

to take down the common wall
between you and Mr Garbleton,

---

and bring together a millinery
and a hatmaker’s shop.

---

If I may be candid

---

Please do.

---

It was love.

---

Oh.

---

And a proposal of marriage.

---

[chuckles]

---

Oh, my.

---

Having spent years as next door neighbors,

---

Mr Garbleton and I became friends,
companions in widowhood one might say,

---

following the death of Mrs Garbleton.

---

God rest her soul.

---

Six months later, my Mr Prattle.

---

God rest his soul.

---

God rest his soul.

---

Then one day, I looked
at our shops side by side like groom

---

and bride, men’s hats in one,
ladies’ the other, and thought,

---

"Why shouldn’t they be conjoined?"

---

I said to him there and then Mr Garbleton,
tear down this wall.

---

[laughter]

---

He did.

---

How remarkable.

---

We’re to be married
this very evening in Henley-on-Thames.

---

My people are very significant there.

---

Mr Garbleton’s rather nervous knowing
they’re prone to judgment.

---

The honeymoon?

---

[chuckling]

---

Just the night, I’m afraid.

---

Commerce never waits for Cupid.

---

Nor should it.

---

Yes. Pardon me just one moment.

---

You’d better not be reading that book.

---

My, what a novel device.

---

The speaking tube.

---

Mr Garbleton had them installed,

---

inspired by romantic notions
of life in the Royal Navy.

---

Also because the intercom wouldn’t
be invented for another 10 years.

---

To begin my life
with the beginning of my life,

---

I recall that I was born,
as I have been informed and believe,

---

on a Friday at twelve o’clock at night.

---

I was told that the clock began to strike,

---

and I began to cry simultaneously
in consideration of the

---

You’d better not be reading that book.

---

Does she have eyes that go round corners?

---

Just read a little more.

---

She won’t know.

---

That book deserves an introduction.

---

Thanks.

---

Turn back time a year and a half.

---

[music]

---

As Mr Garbleton takes Kit aside.

---

You must be an avid reader, Kit.

---

Why do you say that, sir?

---

I found a pile of penny dreadfuls
hidden inside the coal bin.

---

I only read them when things are slow.

---

I’m sure you do.

---

I’ll stop if you want.

---

On the contrary.

---

In fact,
I’d like to lend you a book that ought

---

to reward your time and attention better.

---

Is it the Bible?

---

The Bible?

---

Because I’ve already read it,
even the boring parts.

---

Well then,
I think you might enjoy this even more.

---

Mr Dickens’ works?

---

All of his novels, at least to date.

---

How do they fit them all inside?

---

I don’t know,
the print’s very small as you can see.

---

There are pictures too here and there.

---

Where did you get such a wonderful thing?

---

It was a gift from a very old friend.

---

A very good friend I should think.

---

Oh yes.

---

You see, when I was about your age,

---

I worked in my father’s boot
blacking factory in Hungerford Stairs.

---

One day,
a boy called Charlie came into our employ.

---

His father, like yours,
was sitting in prison for debt,

---

and so the young gentleman,
as we called him then,

---

labored 10 hours each day
but the Lords at Piston Labels

---

on bottles of boot
black for which he was paid 6s a week.

---

Why, that’s less than I make.

---

This was 40 years ago.

---

Charlie was not made
for such toil for he had a quiet,

---

sensitive nature,
observant and quick like you.

---

Thank you, sir.

---

When he flagged
from the strain of the pace,

---

sometimes, I slipped in by his side,
and without a word, we labored together he

---

and I, and over time, became fast friends.

---

Being the seventh son of my father,
I saw I’d have no share in boot blacking,

---

so I apprenticed myself to a hatmaker,
and here we are.

---

Did Charlie’s father
ever get out of prison?

---

He did.

---

That’s a relief.

---

As it turns out,

---

his son was destined for greater things.

---

Greater?

---

What, was the young gentleman Mr Dickens?

---

Only Master Dickens then.

---

Who knew he had so many words in him?

---

You must never judge
a book by its binding,

---

Kit, as I know some have judged
you and your father.

---

A cover conceals more than it reveals.

---

Beneath our hats, we are all the same.

---

Indeed.

---

That is why this hat means so much to me,
and this book.

---

Both are reminders to never
dismiss another person

---

no matter how rough
their outside may seem.

---

I shall take very good care of it, sir.

---

I know you will, Kit.

---

I know you will.

---

Jump ahead a year and a half,
and Lady Plume is still waiting.

---

Kit, bring up Lady Plume’s hat at once.

---

Forgive me.

---

I do hope this new hat will make

---

an impression
wherever you chose to wear it.

---

It will make its debut
this very evening at St James’s Palace

---

when at last I shall meet Her Majesty.

---

Oh, my.

---

As you know, she’s been
in mourning these past four years ever

---

since her beloved Albert
passed beyond the veil.

---

God rest his soul.

---

God rest his soul.

---

God rest his soul.

---

Quiet, Victoria.

---

[dog barking]

---

Hush, Monty.

---

You were saying?

---

As a result, a royal sighting
is as rare now as a winter swallow.

---

If any event occasioned a new hat,
not just any that mind you,

---

but a work of art by Mrs Prattle

---

[chuckles]

---

You flatter me, Lady Plume.

---

I never flatter, and rarely praise.

---

Ah, here is Kit.

---

What took you so long?

---

I had trouble finding the proper box.

---

Let me guess,
it was hidden beneath a book?

---

I’m very sorry to keep you waiting,
my Lady.

---

You kept us both waiting.

---

Yes, ma'am.

---

Well, don’t stand there drooping.

---

Write up Her Ladyship’s
receipt so she can be on her way.

---

Lettie, I can’t seem to find it

---

Oh my heavens, what now?

---

Forgive me, Your Ladyship.

---

Have you seen it?

---

What on earth are you talking about?

---

My cravate.

---

Oh, good gracious, Cabbage.

---

I’ve looked everywhere.

---

Evidently not.

---

How he ever survived two years
without a wife, I’ll never know.

---

It’s the same with His Lordship,
believe me.

---

Pray excuse us.

---

The empire’s trains are never late,
though the empire’s subjects may be.

---

Very true.

---

Come, Cabbage.

---

Oh, my hat.

---

He’d forget his head
if I didn’t remind him.

---

I do hope Your Ladyship will be pleased.

---

Mrs Prattle’s worked hard on this one.

---

I have entrusted myself to her artistry
these many years and never regretted it.

---

I’m very pleased to hear that, my Lady.

---

I would have thought with a name like Kit,

---

that you would be a boy.

---

I’m not.

---

So I see.

---

I have a godson who’s named Christopher,
though the mother calls him Kit.

---

Is your Kit short for anything?

---

Kitty, which is short for Kate,
which is short for Katherine.

---

Katherine is a beautiful name.

---

I have a goddaughter
who’s called Katherine.

---

Why don’t you use that name?

---

Oh well,
we couldn’t afford the extra letters.

---

[chuckling]

---

Oh.

---

This wasn’t true of course.

---

Kit’s Father,

---

The prince of Queen’s prison.

---

Dubbed her Kit at an early age saying

---

She may be compact,
but she is filled with useful things.

---

Like a shaving kit.

---

Or a first aid kit.

---

Which won’t be invented
for another 20 years.

---

[laughter]

---

In case of railroad emergencies.

---

[train whistles]

---

Among the useful things
contained in this kit are

---

A fondness for intricate
puzzles and games.

---

A facility with words and numbers.

---

Although her penmanship is smudgy.

---

And an almost encyclopedic
knowledge of birds

---

she’s never seen based
on their feathers alone.

---

Would Your Ladyship
like to check my figures?

---

At this very moment, the doorbell

---

[bell rings]

---

jingles.

---

Kit looks up to notice two men
on the payroll of Queen’s Prison.

---

Mr Fleece.

---

One of them wears a black eyepatch,
a souvenir from a childhood brawl.

---

You should have seen the other child.

---

His companion walks with a limp.

---

[laughter]

---

I was the other child.

---

They are here to hatch a scheme.

---

A plan so foul, so heinous,
so contemptible.

---

We can take it from here.

---

Oh, okay.

---

[dog barking]

---

There now, Monty.

---

What a pleasant dog.

---

[dog barking]

---

[squeals]

---

Hush. He’s usually
very good with strangers.

---

Well, we all have an off day sometimes.

---

Do you see it, Gnat?

---

See what?

---

It. The hat.

---

It’s a hat shop.

---

The one above all others.

---

The ne plus ultra of hats.

---

You know I don’t speak German.

---

There, on the stand above the stall.

---

That ol' thing?

---

Don’t point.

---

Looks like something somebody cast
aside when they had a proper one made.

---

Indeed, but cast aside by whom?

---

Therein lies the difference
between trash and treasure.

---

Treasure.

---

The reason that I shall soon retire

---

as Chief Warder of Queen’s Prison,
and tender my keys to you.

---

Wait, I thought you said
you was coming into some money.

---

Oh I am, Gnat.

---

I am.

---

Here’s precisely how it will happen.

---

Ne nous dérangez pas jusqu'à 
ce que je vous appelle!

---

There is a French Countess
who lives in exile just outside of London

---

Ah, Monsieur Fleece.

---

For who I have acquired
some valuable items over the years.

---

Ceçi est une phrase qui n’existe que 
pour dire quelque chose en français.

---

[laughter]

---

Et cette phrase aussi, Madam le Countess.

---

I hope she speaks English as well.

---

Just wait.

---

You know that I am a great
collector of beautiful things.

---

I have collected some of them for you.

---

I have never revealed
to you my greatest collection,

---

the one I treasure above all others.

---

I shall be pleased to know it.

---

And so, you shall.

---

Venez!

---

Here, she set her hand
upon a bookcase which swiveled about,

---

revealing a secret room.

---

Just like in the movies.

---

Which won’t be invented
for another 30 years.

---

[laughter]

---

Stepping inside, I soon was surrounded by

---

Hats, my Lady?

---

Not just any hats mon chere Fleece.

---

The headwear of the world’s
most illustrious writers.

---

Regarde.

---

Here is Voltaire’s famous school cap.

---

Goethe’s broad-brimmed hat.

---

The Wellington of Sir Walter Scott.

---

Even the Brontë’s bonnets.

---

Charlotte, Emily, Anne, et Branwell.

---

I believe Branwell Brontë was a man,
milady.

---

I know.

---

[laughter]

---

There are two dozen others,
as you can see.

---

Poets, novelists, essayists,

---

but you will notice
the empty stand at the top.

---

A vacancy waiting to be filled.

---

My crowning achievement, one might say.

---

That is reserved for?

---

The top hat of Monsieur Charles Dickens,
the greatest novel writer

---

in Europe.

---

[laughter]

---

Believe me. I’m familiar.

---

[coughs]

---

Can you get it for me?

---

The hat of Mr Dickens.

---

I must have it.

---

It might be costly.

---

You know my resources.

---

Dangerous even.

---

Name your price.

---

I did.

---

That was?

---

None of your business.

---

Then we have a deal.

---

As they say in Nouvelle York,
how soon can you get it?

---

Within the week.

---

Magnifique.

---

Promise you won’t harm
a hair on the great man’s head.

---

We need more stories from him.

---

He will never know what he has lost,
my Lady.

---

This is that hat?

---

This is that very hat.

---

That hat deserves an introduction.

---

Turn back the hands of time six months.

---

Mr Dickens rides a Southeastern
railway train from Folkestone.

---

[train whistles]

---

Returning from France
to his home in London.

---

From high up in a hot locomotive,

---

an old engineer spies a laborer
frantically waving a red flag.

---

The engineer whistles for breaks

---

[train whistles]

---

and reversed his engine,
but it’s too late.

---

For a length of track had been
removed from the Staplehurst Bridge,

---

and the train now hurtles into the void,

---

plunging down to the river below.

---

Mr Dickens manages to extricate
himself from the vast glass carriage.

---

[music]

---

Surrounded now by the broken and bleeding,

---

he fills his hat from the river
and takes it round to the injured,

---

including
those from the second-class carriages.

---

For some,
it would be their last drink of water.

---

Naturally, he would need a replacement,

---

so Mr Dickens calls upon his old
companion from boot blacking days,

---

which is how the old hat winds
up here at Garbleton and Prattle.

---

[music]

---

Where you and I will steal it tonight.

---

Me?

---

Shh. Don’t shout.

---

I’m not cut out for thievery.

---

All in a good cause, Gnat.

---

Tomorrow, I shall finally retire
from Queen’s Prison for good,

---

and you shall take
my place as Chief Warder,

---

with all the perquisites of the position.

---

All the what?

---

Perquisites.

---

P-E-R-Q-U-I

---

Well, tell them to hold their horses.

---

Literally.

---

It’s everything satisfactory,
Your Ladyship?

---

You’ve never given me
any cause for complaint.

---

I pray I never shall.

---

May Her Majesty smile
at you tonight at her royal levee.

---

[bell rings]

---

May your very significant family smile
upon the groom tonight at your wedding.

---

[chuckling]

---

[bell rings]

---

Ned, come up, it’s time to go.

---

Do these gentlemen
know we’re closing early?

---

I don’t think they’re shopping for hats,
ma'am.

---

My dear Mrs Prattle.

---

Mr Fleece, forgive me.

---

I am in a bit of a flurry.

---

All for good reason, I hope.

---

We’re to be married this evening,
in Henley-on-Thames.

---

Felicitations.

---

You’re here to pick up Kit’s wages,
no doubt?

---

Indeed,
and also to introduce you to my successor.

---

Successor?

---

This is Gnat,
my trusty associate at the prison.

---

Pleased to meet you, Nathaniel.

---

Oh, no, not Nathaniel, ma'am, just Gnat.

---

The G at the front is silent.

---

[laughter]

---

G-N-A-T, like the tiny flies.

---

[chuckles]

---

Irritating but non-threatening.

---

[laughter]

---

My, what an interesting name.

---

[chuckles] There are better.

---

Does this mean
you have accepted another position?

---

Actually, no, ma'am.

---

I expect to come into a little money.

---

You don’t say.

---

Did a wealthy relative give up the ghost?

---

My uncle, Cecil, choked on a sausage.

---

Oh, how dreadful.

---

He died as he lived.

---

In any case, I thought Gnat
should know the ins and outs

---

of the Debtor’s Repayment Program.

---

I think I may have the money right here.

---

[coins jingling]

---


---

Seven and six.

---

Of course.

---

Only 11 weeks left, Mr Fleece.

---

What’s that?

---

Until we’re all paid up.

---

I’ll have to check my records.

---

Could you check now?

---

You’ve got your little red book.

---

Another time perhaps,
when your employer is not in a flurry.

---

But you

---

Don’t press the matter, Kit.

---

He’s quite right.

---

I wish you all the best in your new life,
madam.

---

And I in yours.

---

[laughter]

---

[bell rings]

---

Debtor’s Repayment Program?

---

I mentioned perquisites, didn’t I?

---

I don’t even know what that means.

---

You’re leaving then?

---

Later than I should like.

---

Now, where is Mr Garbleton?

---

Coming, Lettie.

---

I am on my way to you in marriage,
on my way to you.

---

[melodizes]

---

[chuckles]

---

Now I cannot seem to locate my spectacles.

---

You’re wearing them.

---

Oh, yes, so I am.

---

Make sure to lock the front
doors when Kit leaves.

---

Yes, ma'am.

---

We’ll come back by first train tomorrow.

---

Wait.

---

You mean, Ned’s not going with you.

---

Don’t be silly, child.

---

Whatever would he do at a wedding?

---

Be perfectly bored, I am sure of it.

---

You are to be snug in the basement, Ned.

---

There’s plenty of coal.

---

No need to waste it.

---

When you next see us,
you’ll have a new mother.

---

Now, off we go to Charing Cross.

---

To Charing Cross.

---

You keep on Chick Chick,
mommy will be home soon.

---

Feed Victoria.

---

Yes, of course.

---

Ned, you won’t forget?

---

Lettie.

---

Coming, Cabbage.

---

Gracious, we’ve got to get out of here.

---

Get out of here.

---

[bell rings]

---

Suddenly, the bustling shop is quiet.

---

Well.

---

Well.

---

I hope they make the train on time.

---

Yes.

---

[music]

---

I suppose I’ll, to get back to the prison.

---

Listen.

---

[music]

---

Around the corner and down the street,
just on the edge of hearing.

---

Cabins.

---

Working their way from house to house,

---

merchant to merchant,
getting closer at every step

---

and from inside the shop, they listened.

---

BEHOLD THE TINY CHILD,

---

WITHIN A BLANKET BOUND.

---

HIS SHINING FACE CONFIRMS OUR GRACE,

---

BOTH JOYFUL AND PROFOUND.

---

HIS MOTHER WEARS NO RING.

---

NOR RIBBONS IN HER HAIR.

---

YET ON HER BREAST, SHE GIVES HIM REST,

---

AND TENDERS HIM WITH CARE.

---

THE WORLD OF MEN KEEPS TURNING.

---

ITS FOUNDRY FIRES BURNING,

---

AND HARDENS HEARTS AS STRONG AS STEEL,

---

TO WARD OFF HUMAN YEARNING.

---

WHEN HE BECOMES A MAN,

---

MAY THIS BOY STILL RECALL,

---

THE MEMORY OF A MOTHER’S LOVE,

---

WHEN TENDERNESS WAS ALL.

---

THE MEMORY OF HER MOTHER’S LOVE,

---

WHEN TENDERNESS WAS ALL.

---

Down the street and around the corner,
just on the edge of hearing

---

I miss my mother.

---

Me too.

---

I don’t want the new one.

---

I know.

---

She’s embarrassed by me.

---

That’s why I wasn’t asked
to the wedding tonight,

---

so she needn’t introduce
me to her fancy relations.

---

You’ll warm up to each other in time.

---

Just wait and see.

---

I’ll see you tomorrow.

---

Can you stay?

---

Stay?

---

With me.

---

I don’t want to be here all by myself.

---

You won’t be alone.

---

You’ve got Victoria.

---

Feed Victoria.

---

She doesn’t like me.

---

I’m sure she does.

---

Maybe the taste of me.

---

She’s just hungry.

---

She’ll be happier once you feed her.

---

Feed Victoria.

---

Stop talking.

---

Stop talking.

---

Or I can feed her if you prefer.

---

I prefer that you’d stay.

---

Ned.

---

We could stay up all night
reading David Copperfield

---

until the sun comes up,
and then it won’t be dark anymore.

---

I’ll have to stop by the prison first.

---

Why?

---

To let my father know I won’t be
with him or he’ll be lonely.

---

You’ll say with me then?

---

Yes, I’ll stay with you.

---

Yes.

---

Stop talking.

---

I’ll take my feather books with him.

---

That’ll cheer me up.

---

I’ll get it for you.

---

Yes.

---

I think you will need to take a rest.

---

We’ll put your cover on.

---

You know what that means, don’t you?

---

Hey Victoria.

---

No, the other one.

---

God rest his soul.

---

Nice try, but no.

---

Get out of here.

---

I’m trying, believe me.

---

Stop talking.

---

Perfect.

---

I’ll see you in the morning.

---

[bird squawks]

---

Kit ventures into the night

---

feather box beneath one arm.

---

And a blanket wrapped
about her as her only

---

defense against the cold.

---

She heads for Hungerford Bridge.

---

Once a graceful suspension walkway,

---

now a wrought iron cage
of criss-cross girders newly

---

built to corral those modern monsters,

---

locomotives in and out
of Charing Cross Station.

---

She has memorized the railway timetables

---

Naturally.

---

And so knows when a girl may safely
cross the great expanse on foot.

---

She does so now,
pausing in the middle to gaze out

---

through the latticework
to the river beneath.

---

It is dark.

---

Darker than the night.

---

Darker than her mother’s grave,
she thinks.

---

Though she’d rather not.

---

[music]

---

WHAT WERE YOU DOING
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE THAMES?

---

IS THE RIVERBED COVERED
IN JEWELS AND GEMS?

---

NO, THE BOTTOM IS NOTHING
BUT SLUDGE AND STONES.

---

THE FILTH FROM PRIVIES
AND POOR MEN’S BONES.

---

DARKER THAN A LOCKER OF DAVY JONES,

---

IS THE BOTTOM OF THE TAR-BLACK RIVER.

---

[music]

---

A light snow begins to fall.

---

Is it just ash from a nearby factory
spewed out of smokestacks high overhead?

---

WHAT WILL YOU FIND
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE THAMES?

---

IS THE RIVERBED COVERED
IN JEWELS AND GEMS?

---

NO,
THE BOTTOM IS NOTHING BUT SUNKEN BOATS.

---

THE SCREAMS STILL STUCK
IN THEIR SAILOR’S THROATS.

---

FOULER THAN THE WATER IN CASTLE MOATS.

---

IS THE BOTTOM OF THE TAR-BLACK RIVER.

---

[music]

---

No. It’s snow.

---

She can see the crystals melt on her hand.

---

The white flakes floating
down all around and disappearing

---

into the dark to join
the turbid waters below.

---

WHAT WILL YOU FIND
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE THAMES?

---

IS THE RIVERBED COVERED IN
JEWELS AND GEMS?

---

NO,
THE BOTTOM IS NOTHING BUT BROKEN DREAMS.

---

DAFT AMBITIONS AND DESPERATE SCHEMES.

---

THE RUNOFF OF A MILLION WISHFUL STREAMS.

---

[laughter]

---

IT’S THE BOTTOM OF THE TAR-BLACK,

---

BOTTOM OF THE TAR-BLACK,
BOTTOM OF THE TAR-BLACK RIVER.

---

[humming]

---

Her reverie is broken by a distant rumble.

---

The rumbling of an engine
trudging its way down the iron rail.

---

Steaming and screeching.

---

She scurries across before the monster
appears, and plunges into South London.

---

In 29 minutes, she’s in Cell 34,

---

with her father,
"The Prince of Queen’s Prison".

---

A master shoe-buckle maker in an age
where nobody wants shoe buckles.

---

Thus,
his expenses have outpaced his income,

---

and now he lives here,
with the other debtors and their families,

---

along with the petty
thieves and pickpockets.

---

Father?

---

It’s you, Kit.

---

I couldn’t see.

---

I thought, it must be the bucket man.

---

Why haven’t you lit your lantern?

---

I was trying to save the oil
for when it gets dark.

---

If you cant see, it’s dark.

---

That’s what dark means.

---

I meant winter dark.

---

It’s winter now.

---

Already?

---

Since 6:49, this evening,
according to the almanac.

---

Only 89 days till spring.

---

[chuckles]

---

You shouldn’t sit in the dark.

---

It’ll dampen your spirit.

---

I’d rather not see where I am.

---

In the dark,
I can picture myself in our little rooms

---

on Flower Street,
with a coal fire roaring,

---

and something meaty sizzling in the pan,
and Marjorie, that is your mother

---

Yes.

---

Doing whatever she pleases.

---

That’s a good picture.

---

Hold onto that one.

---

What are you holding onto there?

---

My books, the one I told you about.

---

With the feathers?

---

Yes. Look.

---

It’s like an aviary.

---

[chuckles]

---

Mrs Prattle is just mad for feathers.

---

She puts them on everything now,
like the French.

---

When she walks through Trafalgar Square,
the pigeons, they just run the other way.

---

[yells]

---

Surely, you didn’t steal these, Kit?

---

No.

---

No, no,
she gives me the ones that are bent,

---

or broken, or otherwise worthless.

---

You see, that’s why I love them.

---

What’s this one?

---

Ring-neck pheasant.

---

You can tell by those thin, black bars.

---

This?

---

White-bellied swallow.

---

This?

---

Guadalupe caracara. [chuckles]

---

Which will, unfortunately,
be extinct by 1900.

---

This?

---

Chatham bellbird.

---

Also gone.

---

New Zealand quail.

---

Sad, but true.

---

Laughing owl.

---

Not anymore.

---

[bell rings]

---

You know them as well
as if you’d seen them on the wing.

---

I hear them when I fall asleep.

---

Sometimes, they sing for me.

---

I can almost hear them myself.

---

[whistling]

---

[music]

---

I can’t stay tonight, Father.

---

Can’t stay?

---

I’m sorry.

---

Where will you go?

---

Back to the shop.

---

Not still working.

---

No, reading to Ned.

---

The Mr. and Mrs. are getting
married tonight,

---

and he’ll be all alone.

---

Or I’ll be alone.

---

Well, it’s just for the night.

---

He’s very lonely because of the wedding.

---

I thought he would’ve been with them.

---

Keep your lantern lit until curfew.

---

The flame will keep you company.

---

You’ll get me out of here soon,
won’t you, Kit?

---

Very soon, father.

---

I am not as sturdy as I was.

---

We’ll be walking
along the strands by spring.

---

Another whole winter here then.

---

Not even.

---

Have faith.

---

Think about the birds.

---

Meanwhile, only one floor below,
the man with the limp and the man

---

with the eye-patch prepare to return
to the little hat shop on Cromwell Street.

---

All I’m saying is I’ve been
having second thoughts.

---

How can you have second thoughts

---

when I’ve never noticed
you having a first?

---

Well, what if something happens
here while we’re both gone?

---

All the prisoners
will be locked in their cells.

---

The front gate will be latched and bolted.

---

By my calculations, we’ll be out
and back in an hour-and-a-half.

---

Nothing happens in Queen’s Prison, Nat.

---

That’s its purpose, to crush
a man’s spirit with utter boredom.

---

My father was sent here
for debt when I was only nine.

---

He’d sank all our cash in Peruvian silver
mines, which turned out not to exist.

---

My mother, sisters, and I moved in too.

---

Cheaper than renting
a room somewhere else.

---

The Governor, he saw that I had promise.

---

He took pity on me, gave me odd jobs.

---

After my father died,
he even made me a warder,

---

and then chief warder, master of the keys.

---

I have lived my entire life
between iron and stone.

---

Well, no more.

---

As of tomorrow,
I shall retire from Queen’s Prison

---

and turn over all my keys to you.

---

With all the

---

Ah, yes, with all the what?

---

Perkiness.

---

No, not quite, try it again.

---

Percussionist.

---

Look, it’s not that hard.

---

The word is perquisites, all right?

---

Purposes.

---

Purposes.

---

Perks, for short.

---

None of them will be yours
unless we acquire that hat.

---

Lock the front gates.

---

It’s time to go shopping.

---

[grunts]

---

As Kit make her way to the gate,

---

the sound of her footsteps
echoing all around her,

---

her mother’s spirit joins
her in the darkened corridor.

---

[hums]

---

You work so hard.

---

I have to.

---

Your little fingers

---

I know.

---

Full of cuts and calluses.

---

It’s just till father is released.

---

You’re only a child, Catherine.

---

You shouldn’t have to carry
a family on your shoulders.

---

It’s only 11 weeks more,
and then father can go back to work.

---

Making shoe buckles.

---

When is the last time somebody held you?

---

I don’t remember.

---

Then I’ll hold you.

---

You’re not really here.

---

I am.

---

What do you think you’re doing?

---

Oh.

---

Waiting for someone to open the gate.

---

You won’t get back in.

---

I’m here to lock it tight for the night.

---

I’ll come back tomorrow.

---

They say it’s nasty out there.

---

That thing all you got for a coat?

---

I don’t have to go far.

---

Well,

---

may it keep out the cold.

---

Rather stay in myself tonight.

---

Meanwhile, in a stately church

---

in Henley-on-Thames, the choir prepares

---

the congregants for the joyful
union between widow and widower.

---

WHEN THE WINTER WIND IS BLOWING

---

AND THE WORLD HAS LOST IT'S LIGHT,

---

WE WILL KEEP AN EMBER GLOWING,

---

KNOWING WE CAN BRAVE THE NIGHT.

---

HOPE MUST NEVER BE FORSAKEN

---

THOUGH THE DARK BE AT YOUR DOOR.

---

SOON THE SUN WILL REAWAKEN

---

AND THE EARTH WILL WARM ONCE MORE.

---

Back in London, far from the wedding,
the winter wind is bitter and deep.

---

Cat are rolling in the chimneys
and making slutty gutters grown.

---

Kit now makes her way
through Suffolk crossing back

---

over Hungerford Bridge,
not stopping this time to look

---

into the heart of the river, and scuttling

---

between the rails on her way
back to Garbleton and Prattle.

---

On the other side, the flickering
firelight glows in the windows,

---

but still, the snow falls heavily
and it swirls about in circles.

---

When Kit wraps on the door of the shop,

---

her hair is white like an old woman’s.

---

[humming]

---

WHEN DECEMBER SKIES ARE CHURNING

---

AND ALL SIGNS OF LIFE ARE GONE,

---

WE WILL KEEP A CANDLE BURNING.

---

LEARNING WE CAN CARRY ON.

---

SO FEAR NOT A WINTER WEATHER

---

THOUGH THE NIGHT BE COLD AND LONG.

---

LOVE WILL HOLD YOUR HEART TOGETHER,

---

FAITH WILL MAKE YOUR SPIRIT STRONG.

---

Inside the church vestry,
Mrs. Prattle prepares

---

to become Mrs. Garbleton,
and Mr. Garbleton

---

prepares to meet
the very significant family of the bride.

---

Uncle Bart is the Undertaker,
Uncle Bert is the Bishop,

---

and Uncle Barth
is the mayor of Papplewick.

---

He’s the one whose wife has a very pinched
face like someone shut a door upon it.

---

I don’t know how I’ll ever
get the name straight.

---

Don’t be silly.

---

You nearly had them all down on the train.

---

Now let’s start from the top.

---

Who is Adelaide?

---

What is wrong with this waistcoat?

---

You’ve simply bunched up the buttons,
cabbage.

---

No wonder they pop.

---

Here, let me help you.

---

Now, now, you mustn’t be anxious.

---

They’re not as formidable as you suppose.

---

Well, perhaps they are, but you are sure
to pass with flying colors.

---

They just want to know that their little
Atisha is marrying a man of distinction.

---

Whoa.

---

Am I a man of distinction, Letty?

---

Beneath our hats, we are all the same.

---

Now, let’s put on your splendid new hat

---

so they can see how distinguished
my new husband is.

---

Now in the basement, warm again,

---

Kit settles in with Ned,
along with their old friend, Mr. Dickens,

---

and their new one, Master Copperfield.

---

Four friends keeping
company on a frigid night.

---

I was born at Blundeston in Suffolk
or thereby as they say in Scotland.

---

I was a posthumous child.

---

My father did

---

What’s a posthumous child?

---

I think it means his father
died before he was born.

---

My father’s eyes had closed
upon the light of this world

---

six months when mine opened on it.

---

See.

---

It’s very sad.

---

There is something strange to me,
even now,

---

in the reflection that he never saw me.

---

Something stranger
still in the shadowy remembrances

---

I have of my childish
associations of his white gravestone

---

in the churchyard,
and the indefinable compassion

---

I used to feel for it,
lying out alone there in the dark night.

---

Then, our little parlor was
warm and bright with fire

---

and candle,
and the doors of our house were,

---

almost cruelly it seems to me sometimes,
bolted and locked against it.

---

Are you all right, Kit?

---

Oh, yes.

---

There is something strange to me,
even now, in the

---

You already read that.

---

Oh.

---

I did, Ed.

---

Where were we?

---

Outside the shop, a pair of carolers
finds some shelter inside the doorway.

---

WHEN THE SNOW GLISTENS WHITE,
CONSIDER THE HARDY HOLLY.

---

ITS BRANCHES ARE EVERGREEN.

---

ITS BERRIES ARE RED.

---

SUCH A WONDERFUL SIGHT GIVES GOOD REASON

---

TO BE JOLLY FOR LIFE GOES
ON EVERYWHERE AND SPRING LIES AHEAD.

---

La-la-la-la-la-la.

---

Two men approach
through the veil of snowflakes.

---

One with a limp,
the other with a black eyepatch.

---

Oh, curse those blasted carolers.

---

They got to take up residence
just outside the shop.

---

You don’t like carols?

---

I don’t mind carols, it’s carolers I hate.

---

SO REMEMBER THE POOR.

---

Well done,
splendid. Very festive. [clapping]

---

Oh, yes, puts me right in the mood.

---

Yes, yes, thank you.

---

Say, you know who would love some carols?

---

There’s a motley group of orphans
just round the corner there.

---

I bet they could use a frothy song.

---

Orphans, you say, sir?

---

Yes, orphans.

---

Wretched, ragged, huge eyes.

---

Well, I suppose we could bring
them some cheer, aye, Fred?

---

Speaker My thoughts exactly, Bob.

---

Excellent.

---

Thanks for the tip, sir.

---

Thank you.

---

Any time.

---

God bless us, everyone.

---

How did you know there was
orphans round the corner?

---

This is London, Nat.

---

There’s always an orphan
when you need one.

---

Right, let’s see if that hat
is still where we want it.

---

Why wouldn’t it be?

---

Who knows?

---

It’s worth a fortune.

---

They may lock it up at night.

---

Help me look.

---

Once we step over that threshold,
we could be jailed for housebreaking.

---

I want to make sure
that the benefit outweighs the risk.

---

Well, I can’t see a thing.

---

The window is too crowded.

---

There’s a space at the top.

---

Let me climb on your back.

---

What? No.

---

Well, we’ve got to make sure it’s there.

---

Let me climb on you, then.

---

What? I’ve got a bad back.

---

Well, I’ve got a bad leg.

---

Well, I’ve got a bad neck.

---

I’ve got a bad leg.

---

You already said that.

---

Both of them are very bad.

---

Oh, all right. Just make it quick.

---

[grunting]

---

All right, Nat, do you see it?

---

Move me to the right.

---

No, no, no, my right.

---

[crowd laughs]

---

My right is your right.

---

I meant the left.

---

What? What is it?

---

It’s hats.

---

Of course, there are hats.

---

It’s a hat shop, but do you see it;

---

the one at the top of the shop?

---

Move me to the right.

---

Meanwhile,
in a chamber beside the queen’s levy room

---

in st. James Palace,
Lady Plume [bell rings]

---

and her manservant, Styfflip,
make last-minute adjustments

---

to her accouterment
before she is presented to her majesty.

---

So many under-married girls here,

---

Styfflip, all dressed in white.

---

Such delicate roses fresh from the garden

---

can make one feel
like last month’s begonias.

---

Your ladyship is still the freshest
flower in the garden.

---

Oh, Styfflip.

---

You’re an inveterate flatterer.

---

Now, you know why I keep you in my employ.

---

Indeed, milady.

---

Wait till you see this hat.

---

I’m sure Mrs. Prattle has outdone herself.

---

I may have lost the blast
of youth I had at 19, but tonight,

---

this hat will bow to none
other than the queen herself.

---

Outside the shop.

---

Maybe to the right.

---

To the left.

---

Will you make up your mind?

---

All right.

---

Oh.

---

What? What is it?

---

I see it.

---

You’re sure?

---

Dead certain.

---

Perfect.

---

Now, here’s what we’re going to do.

---

Now, I’ll go to work on that lock,
and you keep an eye on the street

---

and let me know if someone’s coming.

---

Yes.

---

Someone’s coming.

---

Right.

---

Now, I’ll pretend to tie my shoelace.

---

Someone’s coming.

---

No, you don’t have to keep saying it.

---

Someone’s here.

---

Good eventide, gentlemen,
or should I say "night"?

---

Constable, ever so glad to see you.

---

Are you?

---

Are we?

---

Such good timing.

---

Why is that?

---

Good question.

---

There is a crime in progress.

---

[whimpers]

---

What sort of crime?

---

Do you hear those carolers?

---

Carolers?

---

Fa-la-la-la-la and all that.

---

I’ve heard of carolers now and again.

---

I had a ringing tenor myself
when I was a younger man.

---

Is that so?

---

As a baby in my prime

---

This particular carolers
are disturbing the peace.

---

Disturbing the peace?

---

Tormenting the orphans.

---

Listen, you can hear them now.

---

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.

---

In a distance.

---

La-la-la-la-la-la-la.

---

I only hear one.

---

Trust me, there are two.

---

La-la-la-la-la-la-la.

---

Oh, yes, I hear them now.

---

[chuckles]

---

What a cheerful sound.

---

Indeed, no one loves a carol more than I,
but surely

---

there’s an ordinance on the books
about singing after hours.

---

I might have to check.

---

Thank you.

---

I can’t keep all the laws
in my back pocket.

---

Of course not.

---

Though I doubt it’s a felony

---

No?

---

More likely a misdemeanor
such as vagrancy,

---

common assault, minor riots,
drunk and disorderly conduct.

---

Oh,
these carolers are probably drunk as well.

---

[gasps]

---

Then I may need to deploy my trencher.

---

You’re a good man, constable

---

Thank you, sir.

---

And gullible as a ripe cheese.

---

Now, get off me.

---

Just one more thing.

---

Yes?

---

I couldn’t help but notice
there’s a man on your back.

---

[laughter]

---

Yes.

---

Who might that be?

---

My brother.

---

Your brother?

---

[laughter]

---

Oh, yes, I see the resemblance.

---

[laughter]

---

Pardon the obvious question,

---

but why is he on your back
in the first place?

---

I got a bad leg.

---

A bad leg?

---

Right.

---

Well, that’s very charitable of you, sir.

---

I promised our mother I would.

---

I can only imagine it would get tiring.

---

Well, ordinarily.

---

Yes, but I’m not heavy, I’m his brother.

---

[laughter]

---

Nicely put, sir.

---

Nicely put.

---

Well, careful walking the icy streets
or you might not have a leg to stand on.

---

[laughs]

---

Oh, ha-ha.

---

[laughter]

---

Well, I better go see about them carolers.

---

Thank the devil he’s gone at last.

---

Now, get off me before my back gives out.

---

Despite your touching declaration,

---

you’re not my brother,
and you weigh a ton.

---

Ow.

---

How are going to get inside?

---

With one of these.

---

You’ve got a key?

---

As Chief Warder of Queen’s Prison,
I happen to be on intimate terms

---

with London’s third best locksmith,
who with minimal coaxing

---

You want me to do what?

---

And a little encouragement

---

My profession has ethical standards.

---

Plus a substantial bribe

---

How’s next Thursday, son?

---

Provided me
with these seven skeleton keys.

---

Skeleton?

---

One of which is guaranteed
to open this lock.

---

I’ve got a thing about skeletons.

---

Oh, too bad,
there’s one hiding inside you.

---

[gasps]

---

[laughter]

---

Now whether he has a backbone
remains to be seen.

---

Let’s try the first one, shall we?

---

Meanwhile in Henley-on-Thames.

---

My family all told me,
Mr. Prattle, God rest his soul,

---

was a man without equal, elegant,
erudite, dapper, but without ostentation.

---

You’ll never find his like again.

---

Won’t they be surprised?

---

Yes, won’t they?

---

In st. James Palace

---

Your hat, My Lady.

---

Thank you, Stiffly.

---

Well, let’s lace the cake then.

---

Put it on.

---

Oh, dear.

---

Oh, my.

---

This can’t

---

What is it?

---

What is it?

---

This can’t.

---

Oh, my.

---

Oh, dear.

---

Well, let me see it.

---

Let me see it.

---

[gasps]

---

[laughter]

---

Oh, dear.

---

Oh, my.

---

Outside the shop.

---

Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.

---

Not that one.

---

Six days later.

---

Not that one neither.

---

Are we inside?

---

If we were, I think I could feel me toes.

---

Then no.

---

It wasn’t. It didn’t work.

---

Are you sure this locksmith
knows his business?

---

I told you, he’s the third-best in London.

---

Maybe I should’ve gone with the best.

---

Oh, thanks, Nat.

---

If stealing priceless hats were easy,
everyone would do it.

---

[sighs]

---

Did you hear the click?

---

What click?

---

The click.

---

That means the difference between having

---

to bamboozle bobbies
and having our dreams come true.

---

Après toi mon ami.

---

Once we cross the threshold,
we’re breaking the law.

---

Don’t tell me you’ve got cold feet.

---

I’m cold all over.

---

Got to be 10 degrees out here.

---

Then,
why don’t you step inside and warm up?

---

[grunts]

---

[bell rings]

---

Come in.

---

[bell rings]

---

[noise]

---

Did you hear that?

---

You don’t suppose
they called off the wedding?

---

Shh-shh-shh.

---

Eerie in here.

---

All these hats with no heads in them

---

like a room full of ghosts.

---

You’ve been reading too much Poe.

---

Next, you’ll be hearing ravens.

---

It’s Mr. Fleece, from the prison.

---

What would he be doing here at this hour?

---

There it is, Nat.

---

Most of our futures, just out of reach.

---

How are we going to get it down?

---

There’s got to be a transom
pole around here, somewhere.

---

Help me look.

---

Mr. Dicken’s hat.

---

I told you we should’ve brought a lantern.

---

We can’t afford to be seen inside,
not with that pesky Bobby about.

---

I am going up there.

---

No, Kit.

---

I think we should go.

---

Oh, just. Where is your spine?

---

Just find that pole,
and we can get out of here.

---

Get out of here.

---

That’s what I said.

---

What?

---

Find us a transom pole.

---

I thought I heard something else.

---

There ought to be one beneath the windows.

---

Stop talking.

---

What did you say to me?

---

I didn’t say anything.

---

[gasping]

---

Who’s there?

---

Show yourself.

---

Get out of here.

---

What?

---

Of course,
we’ll be happy to leave, at once,

---

but we’d like to meet
you first so that we could

---

Feed Victoria.

---

Excuse me?

---

I think she said

---

Please stop talking.

---

Right.

---

Hang on.

---

Get out of here.

---

Our anonymous friend
has an intriguingly limited vocabulary.

---

Feed Victoria.

---

One might almost call it parrot-like.

---

Well, I’ll be

---

You may not be the best watchdog,
but I’ve met worse conversationalists.

---

Stop talking.

---

No, shut up.

---

Come on, let’s find that pole,
so we can get out

---

As a baby in me pram 

---

Oh, god.

---

Gazing up upon me mam,

---

I was rosy cheeked and smiling ear to ear.

---

Mannequin.

---

For she looked upon her boy

---

with a sweet maternal joy

---

and I knew that I had
nothing in this world to fear.

---

Oh,
if I had only known that one day I’d be

---

alone and my mam would be up high in heaven.

---

Forget the pole.

---

Let me climb on your back.

---

I’ve got a bad leg.

---

Don’t start that again.

---

I’ll just be up there for a moment
so I could It’s gone.

---

What?

---

The hat.

---

It’s not there anymore.

---

Well, that’s not possible.

---

Possible or not, it’s true.

---

You don’t suppose the parrot.

---

No, not the parrot, Nat.

---

I think there may be another human
in this shop.

---

I had been reading
to Peggotty about crocodiles.

---

I must have read very perspicuously,

---

or the poor soul must
have been deeply interested

---

for they had
a cloudy expression about them

---

as I had learned
that they were a sort of vegetable.

---

Well, isn’t this a cozy sight.

---

Look, Nat, it’s storytime.

---

Mr. Fleece, what brings you here?

---

Oh,
the same thought popped into my mind, Kit.

---

Why aren’t you back in cell 34?

---

That’s what I asked when she was leaving.

---

You shouldn’t be in the shop at night.

---

My father

---

It’s in Henley-on-Thames
whereby all rights you should be.

---

Was that David Copperfield
you were reading?

---

How would you know?

---

Oh, I know all of Dickens’ works.

---

My, what a voluminous volume.

---

One could kill a rat with that.

---

You’re lucky if I don’t throw it at you.

---

That doesn’t sound
like a Garbleton welcome.

---

I know why you’ve come.

---

Search those boxes.

---

It’s not here.

---

Mr. Garbleton sold it.

---

[laughs]

---

Don’t lie to me, girl.

---

He’d never sell that one,
too much of a sentimentalist.

---

Why do you want it?

---

To sell it, of course.

---

I’m not a sentimentalist.

---

Oh, all of them’s empty.

---

There, what did I tell you.

---

Stand up.

---

Why?

---

Because I said so.

---

I work for Mr. Garbleton, not you.

---

[screams]

---

I said stand up.

---

Don’t touch her.

---

Search those boxes again.

---

I already did.

---

There’s nothing there.

---

Oh, out of my way.

---

I’ll do it myself.

---

One should never judge
a hat box by its lid, Nat.

---

I don’t even know what that means.

---

It means Ah [chuckles],

---

yes.

---

A cover conceals more than it reveals.

---

[gasps]

---

What?

---

It’s all smashed.

---

It’s an opera hat, Nat.

---

Oh, there, look,
there’s his name on the headband,

---

Mr. Charles Dickens Esquire.

---

That hat doesn’t belong to you.

---

I won’t have it for long.

---

It belongs to everyone.

---

No, the stories belong to everyone.

---

This will go to a special someone
who will pay me handsomely for it.

---

Well, look at that.

---

Only 7 and 1/8.

---

Such an average head.

---

One would of thought
it would have to be huge

---

to hold so many people in it.

---

Ms. Havisham, Wilkins Micawber,

---

Fagin, Smike, Ebenezer Scrooge.

---

Now there’s a magician’s hat for sure.

---

How do you know all those characters?

---

A boy shut away in a prison
must have some means of escape.

---

This special someone,
do they love Mr. Dickens too?

---

Enough to get me out
of that prison for good.

---

Put it in a box for me.

---

Boxes are only for paying customers.

---

Which is what I want to look
like if any constables get in my way.

---

Do it.

---

If you leave the prison,
what about my father?

---

Nat will take over the debtors’
repayment program.

---

With all the

---

With all the what, yes?

---

Percocet’s of the position.

---

Percocet, which won’t be
invented for another 100 years.

---

[laughter]

---

It means that he can skim
off whatever he likes

---

and whenever he likes
and as long as he likes

---

and there’s nothing you can do about it.

---

My father is due
to be let out in 11 weeks.

---

Well, we’ll see.

---

That all depends on how quiet
a girl can be about a certain hat.

---

Thank you.

---

Now, get back to Queen’s
Prison where you belong.

---

I can’t get back in.

---

It’s locked for the night.

---

Well then you’ll have to sleep
on the doorstep until it opens again.

---

Here’s your blanket, you may need it.

---

Don’t forget your feather box, Kit.

---

Your father may want to see
the Norwegian peacock.

---

A Norwegian I think you’re right, Nat.

---

I’ll see you tomorrow.

---

What should we do about the boy?

---

Oh, lock him in the basement
so he can’t go yelling for constables.

---

One of these ought to work.

---

Let’s see. How about a Norwegian peacock.

---

What?

---

Peacocks don’t live in Norway.

---

No.

---

Damn and blasted.

---

I can fly.

---

GALLOPING OVER THE SNOW-COVERED
COBBLESTONES.

---

HOLDING OUR HATS ON WITH ALL OF OUR MIGHT.

---

GO FASTER AND FASTER
THE WORLD’S ALABASTER.

---

WE’RE SLEIGHING

---

NOTHING ELSE MATTERS
WE’RE SLEIGHING TONIGHT.

---

ALL OF OUR HORSES
ARE BURSTING THEIR HARNESSES.

---

ALL OF OUR RUNNERS ARE ICY AND WHITE.

---

GO FASTER AND FASTER
THE WORLD’S ALABASTER.

---

WE’RE SLEIGHING, AND NOTHING
ELSE MATTERS WE’RE SLEIGHING TONIGHT.

---

Bam-bam-bam-bam-bam-bam.

---

Kit flys down city streets,
through alleyways,

---

no destination in mind,

---

leaving behind her a trail of footprints

---

in the snow for the man
with the eyepatch to follow.

---

[humming]

---

NOBODY SPEAKS AS THE WIND WHIPS OUR CHEEKS

---

AND A FULL MOON SHINES DOWN FROM ABOVE.

---

THE MOON SHINES DOWN ON US, BAM-BAM-BAM.

---

I HOPE WE KEEP GOING WITH NO SIGN

---

OF SLOWING TILL THE SUN
TAKES ITS PLACE IN THE SKY.

---

Bam-bam-bam-bam.

---

The sleet stings her eyes like tears,
the tears she won’t let herself shed.

---

What good will tears do?

---

Especially when there’s no one
to wipe them away, and so she runs.

---

GALLOPING OVER THE SNOW-COVERED
COBBLESTONES.

---

PUTTING OUR HATS ON WITH ALL OF OUR MIGHT.

---

GO FASTER AND FASTER
THE WORLD’S ALABASTER.

---

WE’RE SLEIGHING, AND NOTHING
ELSE MATTERS WE’RE SLEIGHING TONIGHT.

---

ALL OF OUR HORSES
ARE BURSTING THEIR HARNESSES.

---

ALL OF OUR RUNNERS ARE ICY AND WHITE.

---

GO FASTER AND FASTER
THE WORLD’S ALABASTER.

---

WE’RE SLEIGHING.

---

NOTHING ELSE MATTERS,
WE’RE SLEIGHING TONIGHT.

---

GO FASTER AND FASTER
THE WORLD’S ALABASTER.

---

WE’RE SLEIGHING.

---

NOTHING ELSE MATTERS
WE’RE SLEIGHING TONIGHT.

---

WE’RE SLEIGHING TONIGHT.

---

WE’RE SLEIGHING TONIGHT.

---

WE’RE SLEIGHING, WE’RE SLEIGHING,
WE’RE SLEIGHING TONIGHT.

---

TONIGHT.

---

Her frozen feet lead
her to the Hungerford Bridge

---

as if crossing the river might save her,
lead her back to her father,

---

though she knows he’s trapped
with an iron and stone.

---

She starts across anyway,
stumbling and slipping

---

on the icy rails until nearly
halfway across, she hears

---

You can’t run forever,
not in those filthy rags you call shoes.

---

Even if you could, I’d catch her.

---

You might as well stop and hand it over.

---

Then we both can go back to our evenings.

---

Mr. Dickens used this hat
to comfort people who were dying,

---

no matter if they were rich or poor.

---

Then he’s as naive as your employer.

---

Beneath our hats, we are all the same.

---

If that were true,
why are some dining in Queen’s

---

Palace while others
are pining in Queen’s Prison.

---

We have to take
what we want in this world,

---

for the world will never
give it up freely.

---

You’re wrong.

---

Then prove it.

---

Give it up freely.

---

Never.

---

All right then, I’ll take it.

---

He starts after her and she turns
to run but is stopped by a chilling sound.

---

She never had to memorize
the railway timetables

---

this late at night
and now she wishes she had.

---

Oh, look, a train,
and that’s on a train track.

---

She wonders
whether she might make it across in time

---

before the train reaches the bridge
separating her and her pursuers.

---

She decides to try.

---

Before she could take a single step

---

The light hits her face.

---

The trains up the narrow bridge.

---

Come on,
if you hurry you can make it in time.

---

Now the rest of her is frozen as well.

---

Well, don’t just stand there, run.

---

Fleece rushes toward her.

---

High up in a hot locomotive,

---

an old engineer peers out
through snow and sleet and sees

---

could it be a girl standing in the middle
of the track and a man running toward her?

---

No time for brakes,
not at this speed, not on this ice.

---

Instead, he blows his whistle and prays.

---

The blast jolts Kit and just
in time she clambers

---

onto the outside of the iron bridge,
clinging to its latticework.

---

The train hurdles
by toward the man in pursuit.

---

With no time to spare, he too leaps
onto the crisscross girders out of danger.

---

The engineer opens one eye,
then two, then crosses himself.

---

Leaving a girl and a one-eyed
man clinging to the side

---

of Hungerford Bridge as car
after car of coal rolls by.

---

[background noise]

---

Well, now, you almost got us both killed.

---

Come on, no more games.

---

Hand it over.

---

No.

---

I’ll take it one way or the other.

---

Not if I throw it into the river.

---

Oh, you’d never do that.

---

I might.

---

You just went across half the city
to save it, why destroy it now?

---

To stop you from getting it.

---

Well, now my feelings are hurt.

---

Come on, enough of this.

---

Don’t be silly.

---

Give it to me now.

---

I am not going to give it to you.

---

All right then. How about a trade?

---

A trade?

---

Yes.

---

You give me the hat

---

in exchange for my little red book.

---

By now, the train has crossed the river,

---

clattering on into the city to feed
its hungry factories and furnaces.

---

Why would I want that?

---

You know why, because it’s the only way

---

you’ll prove you already
paid off your father’s debts.

---

Already paid?

---

Without this record,
the last two years would all be for naught

---

and your father will go
on wasting away in Queen’s Prison.

---

If you give that to me,
you’ll be exposed as a thief.

---

I’ll disappear,
and Mordecai Fleece will be no more.

---

The two figures are still,
the iron-work numbing their naked hands.

---

The only sound is the sweep
of wind and the waters far below.

---

Well, Kit, what’s more important;

---

a hat or your father’s freedom?

---

I’m willing to wait, but you’re the one
not dressed for the weather.

---

You’ll give me the book
then I’ll give you the hat.

---

No.

---

You give me the hat
and I’ll give you the book.

---

First, the book then the hat.

---

First, the hat then the book.

---

Book first.

---

Hat first.

---

Book.

---

Hat.

---

Book.

---

Hat.

---

Same time.

---

[grunting]

---

On the count of three, one

---

Two.

---

Hey.

---

Thank you.

---

That’s not fair.

---

I’m the villain.

---

What did you expect?

---

You’re despicable.

---

Oh, look on the bright side.

---

What bright side?

---

You’re right. There isn’t any.

---

Au revoir, or should I say adieu?

---

[screams]

---

At that moment,
there on the side of Hungerford Bridge,

---

the sole of his shoe slips in the snow,

---

and a man with two hats and one
eye falls down, down into the darkness,

---

down through the swirling flakes,
out of sight,

---

toward the tar-black river below until,
at last, wait for it.

---

Sploosh.

---

[bell rings]

---

The only sounds remaining
are wind and chattering teeth.

---

Calm.

---

Calm.

---

NIGHT IS CALM.

---

DARKNESS COMFORTS LIKE A PSALM

---

SO GIVE THANKS NOW PALM TO PALM.

---

THE NIGHT IS CALM.

---

THE NIGHT IS STILL. STILL.

---

NIGHT IS STILL.

---

MAY YOUR DOOR KEEP OUT THE CHILL.

---

MAY TOMORROW BRING GOODWILL.

---

THE NIGHT IS STILL.

---

THE NIGHT IS STILL.

---

Fleece survived his plunge
into the Thames, and was dragged

---

insensible from it by a mackerel
fisherman named Jiles Pigot.

---

This the biggest fish I ever caught.

---

[crowd laughs]

---

When he regained consciousness,

---

Fleece discovered he was
warm and dry and under arrest,

---

thanks to Constable Witslow.

---

Inspector Witslow, if you please.

---

Inside of Fleece’s pocket
was found a little red notebook.

---

It’s pages damp but legible,
documenting every last

---

shilling taken from the so-called
debtor’s repayment program.

---

Money was found in a traveling
case beneath his bed and applied

---

to the debts of the incarcerated
as he had claimed to do all along.

---

He returned to Queen’s Prison,
though no longer master of the keys,

---

to resume his life within iron and stone.

---

Oh, crap.

---

[crowd laughs]

---

Kit, however, in the spirit of the season,

---

brought him her collection
of penny dreadfuls.

---

[crowd laughs]

---

A man shut away in a prison
deserves some means of escape.

---

True to his name,
Nat was declared by her majesty’s court

---

to be "irritating but non-threatening"

---

[crowd laughs]

---

and given a suspended sentence.

---

Though this won’t prevent
it for several decades.

---

Kit’s father was released for good.

---

Father.

---

Kit.

---

[laughs]

---

Mr. Dickens' hat floated all the way

---

to Gravesend before being plucked out,

---

hardly the worse for wear,
by a small girl called Polly Preacher.

---

I said to my mum, "Can I keep it?"

---

Mum said, "Who do you think you are?

---

The Duchess of Cornwall?"

---

[crowd laughs]

---

which means no.

---

Thanks to the Garbleton label inside,

---

it was restored to its place
of honor where it still resides.

---

To celebrate their good fortune,

---

Mr. Garbleton and Mrs. Prattle,
the Garbleton-Prattles,

---

held a dinner inviting Kit and her father

---

and even Lady Plume who kindly accepted

---

along with her Blenheim Spaniel, Montague.

---

[dog barks]

---

She wore her levee hat
to the table having single-handedly

---

launched a new popular
trend in ladies’ headwear.

---

[crowd laughs]

---

I’m so glad it all worked out, milady.

---

[sighs]

---

Ned, would you please pass the potatoes?

---

There’s a dear.

---

Speaker Yes, mother.

---

Feed Victoria.

---

I owe it all to you, Mrs. Prattle.

---

Who would have thought that a woman
of my age would become a model of fashion?

---

[chuckles]

---

My fondest wish
at the moment would be to bring

---

back an item left behind by haute
couture in the last century.

---

What might that be?

---

Shoe buckles.

---

Shoe buckles?

---

But, alas, no one makes them anymore.

---

Actually, I know someone who does.

---

This brings our story to a close.

---

So we can return you to the present.

---

November 28, 2021.

---

And all the different hats you wear.

---

May they fit you well.

---

And keep you warm
through all your days and nights to come.

---

[bell rings]

---

WHEN THE SNOW GLISTENS WHITE,
CONSIDER THE HARDY HOLLY.

---

ITS BRANCHES ARE EVERGREEN,
ITS BERRIES ARE RED.

---

SUCH A WONDERFUL SIGHT.

---

GIVES GOOD REASON TO BE JOLLY.

---

FOR LIFE GOES ON EVERYWHERE
AND SPRING LIES AHEAD.

---

BUT NOT ALL SOULS ARE GLAD
AS SNOW PILES EVER HIGHER.

---

NO MATTER
HOW BEAUTIFUL THE HOLLY MAY GROW.

---

WHEN NO FOOD CAN BE HAD,
NOR FUEL FOR A HUMBLE FIRE,

---

THE SPRINGTIME IS FAR
AWAY AND WINTER IS SLOW.

---

SO REMEMBER THE POOR,
THE SICK, AND THE MELANCHOLY,

---

LEST YOU BE PREOCCUPIED
WITH DAILY AFFAIRS.

---

THEN THROW OPEN YOUR DOOR,
BE FREE-HANDED LIKE A HOLLY.

---

THERE’S PLENTY FOR EVERYONE
WHEN EVERYONE SHARES.

---

THERE’S PLENTY FOR EVERYONE
WHEN EVERYONE SHARES.

---

[bells ring]

---

[crowd cheers and applauds]

---
