## MR ELTON:
I pronounce that they be man and wife together.
---
## EMMA:
Are they not a handsome couple? I made the match myself. 
---
## EMMA:
My governess, Miss Taylor, and the dear widower, Mr. Weston.
---
## EMMA:
I have a gift, you see: I can see into everyone's heart. 
---
## EMMA:
Miss Taylor is much more a dear friend than a governess, however. 
---
## EMMA:
What shall I do now that she has gone? However shall I employ myself?
---
## MR WESTON:
I am the happiest man alive!
---
## MR WOODHOUSE:
Congratulations, my dear Miss Taylor.
---
## EMMA:
Papa -- she is Mrs. Weston, now.
---
## MR WOODHOUSE:
Yes, yes, Mrs. Weston....
---
## MRS WESTON:
Emma, my dear!
---
## EMMA:
I wish you every happiness, Mrs. Weston. I can not call you Miss Taylor any more.
---
## MRS WESTON:
Oh, Emma, I am a most fortunate woman.
---
## EMMA:
Papa and I can ill bear to part with you, however.
---
## MRS. WESTON:
That is my only regret - the separation from friends. 
---
## MRS. WESTON:
And friends we shall remain - you hardly
have need of me as your governess any longer.
---
## EMMA:
But Miss Tayl----, sorry, Mrs. Weston ... 
---
## EMMA:
you are the one to whom I could speak every thought as it arose, 
---
## EMMA:
and you had such affection for me that you never found fault. 
---
## EMMA:
However, there is such comfort in the easy distance of your new home from Hartfield.
---
## MRS. WESTON:
No hindrance to our spending half the evenings in the week together.
---
## MR WOODHOUSE:
Oh, Miss Tayl--Mrs. Weston, you are always welcome with us you know, 
---
if Mr. Weston's house proves too damp. I do not wish you to fall ill.
---
## EMMA:
Oh, Papa...
---
## MR WESTON:
My dear, look who is here - ## MISS BATES: and Mrs. Bates!
---
## MISS BATES:
Oh, Mr. Weston, Mrs. Weston, such a wedding! Wasn't it, mother?
---
## MRS. WESTON:
Thank you, friends.
---
## EMMA:
And to think, Mr. Knightley – I predicted this marriage.
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
No such thing, Emma.
---
## EMMA:
I served as match-maker. My governess, Miss Taylor, and the amiable Mr. Weston.
---
## MR. WOODHOUSE:
Poor Miss Taylor. My dear, pray do not make any more matches.
---
## EMMA:
Not for myself, Papa; but I must for other people. It is the greatest amusement in the world!
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
People are not amusements, Emma.
---
## EMMA:
Such a success.
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
Success? Success supposes endeavor. You made a lucky guess.
---
## EMMA:
Have you never known the pleasure of a lucky guess? I thought you cleverer.
---
## MR WOODHOUSE:
And now Miss Taylor will leave us.
---
## EMMA:
Indeed, Papa, such a loss. How shall we do without her? She has been a companion such as few possess.
---
Luck is never just luck. It reveals talent. I promoted this match and gave little encouragements.
---
## MR WOODHOUSE:
A grievous business. She looks feverish.
---
## EMMA:
Papa, I have not seen her look better in my life. The Westons harmonize so well.
---
Do not you think so, Mr. Knightley?
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
Indeed. If Weston had asked me to recommend him a wife, I should certainly have named Miss
---
Taylor. Her good humor is rather thrown away on a man with such agreeable manners.
---
## EMMA:
I have made a perfect match. 
---
## EMMA:
It was quite generous of me 
---
## EMMA:
considering how the lack of Miss Taylor will be felt every hour of every day.
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
But your sense and energy will bear you through this difficulty, Emma.
---
## EMMA:
Thank you, Mr. Knightley. 
---
## EMMA:
Do you recall that I foretold your brother John 
---
## EMMA:
and my sister Isabella would marry?
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
Nonsense.
---
## EMMA:
And they now have four children! The youngest named for me, of course.
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
A mere formality. But I do hope our niece, little Emma, has your liveliness of spirit.
---
## EMMA:
Do you? You do not find my spirits vexing?
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
Not at all. I simply wish your character to be as elevated as your spirits.
---
## EMMA:
More books, I imagine.
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
Well, more Milton perhaps.
---
## EMMA:
Does not our vicar, Mr. Elton, look like he would wish his own hand joined in matrimony to someone suitable?
---
## MR WOODHOUSE
Oh, no, Emma.
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
Mr. Elton can take care of himself.
---
## EMMA
Poor Mr. Elton! He has fitted up the vicarage so comfortably.
---
## MR WOODHOUSE:
Invite him to dinner, Emma. That will be a much better thing. 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
I agree with your father heartily. 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
Feed him, but leave him to choose his own wife.
---
## EMMA: 
It would be a shame to have him single any longer.
---
## EMMA:
Thank you, Mr. Elton, for a beautiful ceremony.
---
## MR ELTON:
Of course, Mr. Weston. 
---
## MR ELTON:
Surely this is an advantageous marriage that has secured the permanent happiness of many.
---
## EMMA:
As every marriage should do....
---
## MR ELTON:
Exactly so, Miss Woodhouse. Marriage is an honorable estate.
---
## MISS BATES:
Oh, such a marriage to celebrate. Cake! There is cake, mother. 
---
If only your son could have
attended, dear Mr. Weston. 
---
We do long to meet Mr. Frank Churchill.
---
## MR. WESTON:
Ah,Miss Bates, I am afraid Frank's aunt is so very ill, he could not be spared.
---
## MRS WESTON:
Frank has written us a very handsome letter, however.
---
## FRANK:
Dear father, warmest congratulations to you and your bride! 
---
I regret to say my Aunt Churchill's health will not allow me to visit you...
---
## MISS BATES:
Oh - a highly-prized letter, indeed! And his aunt and uncle -- the Churchill's, mother
---
## MISS BATES:
have been so kind, such a great family to adopt little Frank when his poor mother died. 
---
## MISS BATES:
And to make Frank the heir to the Churchill fortune! 
---
## MISS BATES:
That is why, mother, that Mr. Weston's son is called Frank Churchill
---
## MISS BATES:
because he was adopted by his wealthy aunt and uncle ... the Churchill's, mother.
---
## MR WESTON:
Frank's Aunt Churchill is often unwell, 
---
## MR WESTON:
and she rarely can spare him from their home in Yorkshire. 
---
## MR WESTON:
I did see Frank in London last winter, and he hopes to visit us here in Highbury very soon.
---
## EMMA:
I have a great curiosity to finally meet Mr. Frank Churchill!
---
## MISS BATES:
As do we all, Miss Woodhouse. Such anticipation, mother! Come along. 
---
## MR. WOODHOUSE:
Do not eat the cake, ## MISS BATES: – very hard on the digestion.
---
## MRS WESTON:
Perhaps, Emma, you shall be the next to marry.
---
## EMMA:
I have very little intention of marrying, Mrs. Weston.
---
## MRS WESTON:
I know you have always said so, 
---
## MRS WESTON:
but perhaps if there were someone in the neighborhood 
---
## MRS WESTON:
of suitable character and condition.
---
## EMMA:
I am perfectly content as I am. 
---
## EMMA:
Fortune I do not want, consequence I do not want. 
---
## EMMA:
And never, never could I expect to be so truly beloved, 
---
## EMMA:
and important, and always right in any man's eyes 
---
## EMMA:
as I am in my father's.
---
## MRS WESTON:
Well, certainly there has never been a better daughter.
---
## EMMA:
As I grow older, I shall employ myself with my nieces and nephews. 
---
## EMMA:
I shall often have a niece with me.
---
## MR. WOODHOUSE:
Will you accompany us home to Hartfield, Mr. Knightley? 
---
## MR. WOODHOUSE:
Though the hour is late, I fear....
---
## MR. KNIGHTLEY:
Of course, sir. It is a beautiful moonlit night.
---
## MR. WOODHOUSE:
Poor Miss Taylor! 
---
## MR. WOODHOUSE:
What a pity it is that Mr. Weston ever thought of her, my dearest Emma.
---
## EMMA:
Papa, you would not have had her live with us forever, 
---
## EMMA:
and bear all my odd humors?
---
## MR. WOODHOUSE:
You never have any odd humors, my dear.
---
## EMMA:
We shall be going to see them often, and they coming to see us.
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
The Westons are but half a mile away.
---
## MR. WOODHOUSE:
How am I to get there? I could not walk half so far.
---
## EMMA:
Nobody thought of your walking, Papa. We must go in the carriage, to be sure.
---
## MR. WOODHOUSE:
Oh, the carriage
[sighs]
---
## EMMA:
Not everything is a dreadful change. 
---
Our friend Mr. Knightley is here as usual, Papa, spending his evening with us.
---
## MR. WOODHOUSE:
Dear Emma bears everything so well, but, Mr. Knightley, 
---
she is really very sorry to lose poor Miss Taylor.
---
## MR. KNIGHTLEY:
It is impossible that Emma should not miss such a companion. 
---
We should not like her so well as we do, sir, if we could suppose it.
---
## EMMA:
I shall miss her as I would a sister. 
---
## MR. WOODHOUSE:
But every friend must be glad to have her so happily married.
---
## MR WOODHOUSE:
Oh, dear.
[sighs]
---
## EMMA: 
There is a great difference between a Miss Taylor in the house 
---
## EMMA:
and a Mrs. Weston even a mere half a mile away. 
---
## EMMA:
Shall I fix on a new endeavor?— 
---
## EMMA:
I could improve my French. 
---
## EMMA:
Or my singing. I need a magnificent project. 
---
## EMMA:
There is Mr. Elton... so deserving of an excellent match, 
---
## EMMA:
do you not think so?
---
## MR. WOODHOUSE:
Emma, my dear. We have a guest from the boarding school for our card party tonight
---
## MR. WOODHOUSE:
a Miss Harriet Smith. But Miss Smith
---
## MR. WOODHOUSE:
Does. Not. Play. Whist!
---
## EMMA:
I shall take Miss Smith in hand.
---
## HARRIET:
Miss Woodhouse, I am so grateful to be invited to Hartfield. 
---
## HARRIET:
Your home is so beautiful, in so superior a style.
---
## EMMA: 
Such good sense! Might she be the "something" my life requires? 
---
## EMMA:
I could be useful to Harriet Smith. 
---
## EMMA:
You must come and visit Hartfield often, Harriet.
---
## EMMA:
Harriet, what is your parentage?
---
## HARRIET:
I do not know, Miss Woodhouse. 
---
## HARRIET:
I have been at the boarding school as long as I can remember.
---
## HARRIET:
My parents, whoever they may be, placed me there. 
---
## HARRIET:
But I am quite grateful for my situation.
---
## EMMA:
Do you have particular friends at the school?
---
## HARRIET:
I am quite fond of the Miss Martins! 
---
## HARRIET:
I spent two very happy months this summer with the Martin family, at Abbey-Mill Farm.
---
## EMMA:
Oh.
---
## EMMA:
So, the Martins are ... farmers?
---
## HARRIET:
Yes. They are tenant farmers on Mr. Knightley's estate. 
---
## HARRIET:
And they have two parlors, and eight cows. 
---
## HARRIET:
And Mr. Robert Martin is ever such a good farmer and ever so good-natured.
---
## EMMA:
This Robert Martin is their father?
---
## HARRIET:
No, their brother.
---
## EMMA:
And he is a ... single man?
---
## HARRIET:
To be sure!
---
## HARRIET:
He has been bid more for his wool than anybody in the county. 
---
## HARRIET:
And he is so very obliging. 
---
## HARRIET:
He went three miles out of his way one day in order to bring me some walnuts, 
---
## HARRIET:
because I had said how fond I was of them. 
---
## HARRIET:
I believe everybody speaks well of him, even Mr. Knightley.
---
## EMMA:
Indeed.
---
## EMMA:
Good morning, Mr. Elton.
---
## MR ELTON:
Ah, the illustrious Miss Woodhouse, and her sweet friend Miss Smith!
---
## HARRIET:
Good morning, Mr. Elton.
---
## EMMA:
You see, Harriet, our intimate friendship is now a settled thing.
---
## HARRIET:
And I am so grateful, Miss Woodhouse! 
---
## HARRIET:
It is so pleasant to happen upon such marvelous neighbors. 
---
Do you ever see Mr. Robert Martin? 
---
## HARRIET:
He passes through Highbury very often.
---
## EMMA:
That may be, but a farmer is the last sort of person to raise my curiosity. 
---
## EMMA:
A degree or two lower, and I might hope to be useful in some way of charity. 
---
## EMMA:
But a farmer can need none of my help, 
---
## EMMA:
and is, therefore, as much above my notice as he is below it.
---
## HARRIET:
To be sure.
---
## EMMA:
Harriet, the misfortune of your birth ought to make you particularly careful as to your associates. 
---
## EMMA:
There can be no doubt of your being a gentleman's daughter, 
---
## EMMA:
and I want to see you permanently well connected.
---
## HARRIET:
To be sure. Yes. Why look – here comes Robert Martin!
---
## EMMA: 
I see no alarming symptoms of love. 
---
## EMMA:
His appearance is neat, and he looks sensible. 
---
## EMMA:
But he is not a gentleman.
---
## HARRIET:
Only think of our happening to meet him! 
---
## HARRIET:
Well, Miss Woodhouse, what do you think of him?
---
## EMMA:
I think, Harriet, since your acquaintance with us, you have been in the company of some real gentlemen, 
---
and you must be struck with the difference in Mr. Martin.
---
## HARRIET:
To be sure, he is not so genteel as a real gentlemen. 
---
Certainly, he is not like Mr. Knightley.
---
## EMMA:
Mr. Knightley! You might not see one in a hundred with gentleman so plainly written as in Mr. Knightley. 
---
## EMMA:
But compare Mr. Martin with Mr. Weston or Mr. Elton. 
---
## EMMA:
You must see the difference.
---
## HARRIET:
Oh yes! There is a great difference.
---
## EMMA:
Did you note Mr. Elton's words? 
---
## EMMA:
He said you had a "sweet" disposition.
---
## HARRIET:
I have always thought Mr. Elton very agreeable.
---
## MR ELTON:
Miss Woodhouse – Miss Smith was a beautiful creature when she came to you, but, in my opinion, 
---
## MR ELTON:
the attractions you have added are infinitely superior to what she received from nature.
---
## EMMA:
I am glad you think I have been useful to her, Mr. Elton; 
---
## EMMA:
but Harriet had all the natural sweetness
of temper in herself. 
---
## EMMA:
I have done very little.
---
## MR ELTON:
If it were admissible to contradict a lady....
---
## EMMA:
I have perhaps given her a little more decision of character.
---
## MR ELTON:
Exactly so; So much super-added decision of character! 
---
## MR ELTON:
Skillful has been the hand!
---
## EMMA
Great has been the pleasure. Harriet – did you ever have your likeness taken?
---
## HARRIET:
Oh! dear, no, never.
---
## EMMA
What an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be.
---
## MR ELTON:
Let me entreat you, Miss Woodhouse, to exercise so charming a talent in favor of your friend.
---
## EMMA:
Well, if you give me such kind encouragement, Mr. Elton, I believe I shall try what I can do.
---
## MR ELTON:
Delightful! Do you not think so, Mrs. Weston?
---
## MRS WESTON:
The expression of the eye is correct, but Miss Smith has not those eyebrows.
---
## MR ELTON:
It appears to me a most perfect resemblance, Mrs. Weston. 
---
We must allow for the effect of shade, you know.
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
I believe you have made her too tall, Emma.
---
## MR ELTON:
Oh no! not in the least too tall. Consider, she is sitting down....
---
## EMMA:
Papa, what do you think?
---
## MR WOODHOUSE:
Oh, it is very pretty, my dear. But she seems to be sitting out of doors
---
and it makes one think she must catch cold.
---
## EMMA:
But, my dear Papa, it is supposed to be summer. Look at the tree.
---
## MR WOODHOUSE:
But it is never safe to sit out of doors, my dear.
---
## MR ELTON:
You, sir, may say anything, but I regard it as a happy thought, 
---
## MR ELTON:
the placing of Miss Smith out of doors.
---
## EMMA:
That will do.
---
## MR ELTON:
I can not keep my eyes from it.
---
## EMMA:
The next thing wanted is to get the picture framed.
---
## MR ELTON:
Might I be trusted with the commission? 
---
## MR ELTON:
What infinite pleasure should I have in executing it! 
---
## MR ELTON:
I shall ride to London. What a precious deposit! 
---
## HARRIET:
So gallant!
---
## EMMA:
Do you see, Harriet, how Mr. Elton does sigh and languish!
---
## EMMA: aside
He will suit Harriet exactly!
---
## HARRIET:
Miss Woodhouse, something extraordinary has happened.
---
## EMMA
Oh?
---
## HARRIET:
Mr. Robert Martin has written me a letter that contains a direct proposal of marriage. 
---
So surprised – and he writes as if he really loves me very much
---
but I do not know – will you read the letter?
---
## HARRIET:
Is it a good letter?
---
## EMMA:
Yes. Indeed. A very good letter, Harriet, very good indeed.
---
## HARRIET:
Well—and what shall I do?
---
## EMMA:
You must answer it of course, and speedily.
---
## HARRIET:
Yes. But what shall I say, Miss Woodhouse?
---
## EMMA:
Oh no, no! the letter had much better be all your own. Your meaning must leave no doubts, 
---
with much gratitude, and concern for the pain you are inflicting.
---
## HARRIET::
You think I ought to refuse him then.
---
## EMMA:
Are you in doubt? I thought—You mean to return a favorable answer?
---
## HARRIET:
No, I do not; that is—What shall I do? Pray, dear Miss Woodhouse, tell me what I ought to do.
---
## EMMA:
I shall not give you any advice, Harriet. 
---
This is a point which you must settle with your own feelings.
---
## HARRIET:
I had no notion that he liked me so very much.... 
---
It will be safer to say 'No' perhaps. Do you
think I had better say 'No'?
---
## EMMA:
Not for the world would I advise you either way. 
---
If you prefer Mr. Martin to every other person,why should you hesitate?
---
## HARRIET:
I have now quite determined, and really almost made up my mind—to refuse Mr. Martin. 
---
## HARRIET:
Do you think I am right?
---
## EMMA:
Perfectly, perfectly right, my dearest Harriet. 
---
## EMMA:
While you were in suspense I kept my feelings to myself, 
---
## EMMA:
but now that you are completely decided I have no hesitation in approving. 
---
## EMMA:
Dear Harriet, it would have grieved me to lose your acquaintance,
---
## EMMA:
I could not have visited Mrs. Robert Martin of Abbey-Mill Farm.
---
## HARRIET:
You could not have visited me! No, to be sure you could not. 
---
## HARRIET:
That would have been too dreadful! 
---
## HARRIET:
I am quite determined to refuse him. But what shall I say?
---
## EMMA:
I am sure you do not need my assistance, but I may help with a few decisive expressions.... 
---
## EMMA:
And let us think of our absent friends. 
---
## EMMA:
At this moment, perhaps, Mr. Elton is showing your portrait to his family in London, 
---
## EMMA:
telling how much more beautiful is the original.
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
I must confess, Emma, that you have improved Harriet Smith. 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
Her manners are greatly refined.
---
## EMMA:
Thank you, Mr. Knightley. And I appreciate the sentiment coming from you. 
---
You do not often overpower me with praise, you know.
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
I have good reason to believe your friend will soon hear of something to her advantage.
---
## EMMA:
Indeed! of what sort?
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
I think that Harriet Smith will soon have an offer of marriage. 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
Robert Martin is the man. He is desperately in love and means to marry her.
---
## EMMA:
He is very obliging, but is he sure that ## Harriet means to marry him?
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
Well, means to make her an offer then. He came to consult me about it. 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
He is an excellent young man. He proved to me he could afford it. 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
I praised Harriet as very pretty and having a good disposition. 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
I believe he will speak to her very soon.
---
## EMMA:
He wrote to Harriet yesterday ... and was refused.
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
Harriet Smith refuse Robert Martin? I hope you are mistaken.
---
## EMMA:
I saw her answer. Nothing could be clearer.
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
You saw her answer — you wrote her answer. Emma, you persuaded her to refuse him.
---
## EMMA:
And if I did, I should not feel that I had done wrong. 
---
## EMMA:
Mr. Martin is very respectable, but I can not
admit him to be Harriet's equal.
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
Not Harriet's equal! What are Harriet Smith's claims to any connection higher than Robert Martin? 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
She is the natural daughter of nobody knows whom. The advantage of the match is all on her side. 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
I even remember saying to myself, 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
Even Emma, with all her partiality for Harriet, will think this a good match.
---
## EMMA:
A farmer, a good match for my intimate friend? 
---
## EMMA:
Mr. Martin may be the richer of the two, but the sphere in which Harriet moves is much above his. 
---
## EMMA:
There can scarcely be a doubt that her father is a gentleman.
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
Whoever might be her parents, it does not appear to have been part of their plan 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
to introduce her into what you would call good society. 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
You have been no friend to Harriet Smith, Emma.
---
## EMMA:
Harriet's claims to marry well are not so meager. 
---
## EMMA:
Let us suppose her to be only "pretty and good-natured". 
---
## EMMA:
These are not trivial recommendations. 
---
## EMMA:
Till men fall in love with brilliant minds instead of beautiful faces, 
---
## EMMA:
a girl with such loveliness as Harriet has a certainty of being sought after.
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
Let Harriet marry Robert Martin, 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
and she is respectable and happy for ever; 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
but if you encourage her to expect to marry greatly 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
she may be a boarder at the school all the rest of her life.
---
## EMMA:
We think so very differently on this point, Mr. Knightley, 
---
## EMMA:
that there can be no use in canvassing it. 
---
## EMMA:
She knows now what gentlemen are; and nothing but a gentleman has any chance with Harriet.
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
A gentleman? Emma, if you think Elton is the man for Harriet, 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
your match-making will be all in vain. 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
Elton is a respectable vicar, and not at all likely to make an imprudent match.
---
## EMMA:
At present I only want to keep Harriet to myself. I have done with match-making.
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
Hm. You have a scheme, Emma. For Miss Smith's sake, take care.
---
## EMMA:
Should I repent what I have done? 
---
## EMMA:
No. I am a better judge of female refinement than he could be. 
---
## EMMA:
But I have a sort of habitual respect for Mr. Knightley's judgment. 
---
## EMMA:
This is very disagreeable. 
---
## EMMA:
Mr. Knightley could not have observed Mr. Elton's strong passion, however, as I have done. 
---
## EMMA:
Oh, here comes Harriet – in very good spirits!
---
## HARRIET:
Oh, Miss Woodhouse! 
---
## HARRIET:
Miss Bickerton met Mr. Elton on his way to London. 
---
## HARRIET:
Mr. Elton said something about a very enviable commission, 
---
## HARRIET:
and being the bearer of something exceedingly precious.
---
## EMMA:
Oh! He must be very much in love with you.
---
## HARRIET:
I can not imagine such a thing! But whatever you say is always right, and therefore I believe it
must be so. 
---
Mr. Elton: the very handsomest man that ever was!
--- 
## MR WOODHOUSE:
Oh, such a delight!
---
## EMMA:
Well, Mr. Knightley, there can hardly be a happier creature in the world than my Papa, 
---
now that my sister Isabella and your brother, and their children have arrived at Hartfield. 
---
You seem quite captivated with your newest niece. Although I believe she takes after my side of the family.
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
Little Emma is a complete angel. And you are correct, 
---
I see nothing of my brother, John, in her
face, which is a godsend.
---
## EMMA:
What a comfort it is that we think alike about our nephews and nieces. 
---
As to men and women,our opinions are sometimes very different.
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
If you were guided as much by common sense in your estimation of men and women as you are with these children, we might always think alike.
---
## EMMA:
To be sure, our discordancies must always arise from my being in the wrong.
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
Yes, and for good reason. I am older and wiser than you. I remember when you were born.
---
## EMMA:
And no doubt you were much my superior in judgment when I was an infant; 
---
but does not the lapse of one-and-twenty years bring our understandings a good deal nearer?
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
Yes. A good deal nearer.
---
## EMMA:
But still not near enough to give me a chance of being right, if we think differently.
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
I still have the advantage of several years experience.
---
## EMMA:
Ah. A material difference that shall never change. 
---
How convenient for you.
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
Come, my dear Emma, let us be friends and say no more about it. 
---
Tell your aunt and uncle, little Emma, that we ought to set you a better example than to be renewing old grievances.
---
## EMMA:
Very true. Little Emma, grow up a better person than your elders. 
---
Be infinitely cleverer and not half so conceited. 
---
Now, Mr. Knightley, I only want to know that Mr. Robert Martin is not very, very bitterly disappointed.
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
A man can not be more so.
---
## EMMA:
Ah! Indeed, I am very sorry. 
---
Come, shake hands with me.
---
## MR WOODHOUSE:
Oh, my dear Emma – your sister Isabella, and, of course, your brother, Mr. Knightley, 
---
are determined to visit the Weston's for their Christmas Eve party tomorrow. 
---
Do you think it wise? It grows colder by the day.
---
## EMMA:
We shall ensure we all remain safe and warm, Papa.
---
## MR WOODHOUSE:
The folly of it! Leaving our own fireside, in defiance of the voice of nature. 
---
I suppose there is no avoiding it, at Christmas.
---
## EMMA:
I think not, Papa. And it shall be a merry party! All of your friends will be in attendance.
---
## MR WESTON:
Welcome, everyone! Merry Christmas!
---
## MR WOODHOUSE:
Merry Christmas.
---
I do hope it does not snow.
---
## EMMA:
Oh, Mr. Elton, such sad news: 
---
Harriet Smith has a sore throat and is too ill to attend the party.
---
Such a sad loss to our festivities tonight.
---
## MR ELTON:

Exactly so. She will be missed every moment.
[sighs]
---
Christmas! The season for friendly meetings!
---
## MISS BATES:
Such Christmas gaieties, mother! 
---
Oh, Mr. Knightley, we have had a letter from my niece Jane Fairfax. Haven't we, mother?
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
Ah, yes, Miss Bates - Wednesday is your day to receive a letter from Miss Fairfax, is it not?
---
## MISS BATES:
Indeed. So kind of you to remember, Mr. Knightley, Wednesday is the day. 
---
Although, it sometimes arrives on a Tuesday! Quite a thrill!
---
## EMMA:
My dear Mrs. Weston, such a lovely Christmas party!
---
## MRS WESTON:
Thank you, dear Emma.
---
## MR WESTON:
Ah, Miss Woodhouse, we have had a letter from my son Frank Churchill this morning.
---
## EMMA:
Oh, indeed?
---
## MRS WESTON:
He is coming to Highbury for a visit!
---
## EMMA:
What a great pleasure it will be for you!
---
## MRS WESTON:
We hope it shall be a pleasure for you to meet him as well, Emma.
---
## EMMA:
Oh, certainly. To all of us who have heard so much about Mr. Frank Churchill.
---
## MR WESTON:
He had hoped to attend our wedding, but he can not command his own time. 
---
He has those to please who must be pleased.
---
## MRS WESTON:
Frank depends entirely upon his aunt's spirits. Mrs. Churchill rules the family. 
---
Frank can not make any decisions about his future without her consent.
---
## EMMA:
Oh, I see.
---
## MRS WESTON:
I am still afraid that some excuse may be found for him not visiting us, 
---
and disappointing us once again.
---
## MR WESTON:
Let us hope not, my dear, let us hope not.
---
## EMMA:
Did you hear, Mr. Knightley? We shall finally meet the famous Mr. Frank Churchill. 
---
His aunt has at last given him leave to visit Highbury. 
---
She has always an excuse to keep him to herself.
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
Mrs. Churchill is likely in fault, but I dare say he might come if he would.
---
## EMMA:
He wishes always exceedingly to come; but his aunt will not spare him.
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
And yet some months ago, we hear he was at the seaside resort in Weymouth. 
---
This proves thathe can leave the Churchills if he is inclined to seek his own pleasure.
---
## MISS BATES:
Look mother, the snow is falling faster. Lovely little swirls.
---
## MR WOODHOUSE:
And with a drifting wind! Oh, dear me.
---
## MISS BATES:
It looks just like icing sugar!
---
## MR WESTON:
I rather wish the road might be drifted over: we could keep you all here. Isn't that right, my dear.
---
## MRS WESTON:
We have only two guest rooms, my dear.
---
## MR ELTON:

I was snowed up at a friend's house once. 
---
I went for one night, and could not get away for a
week.
---
## MISS BATES:
Snowed in, mother, til New Years! What do you think?
---
## MR WOODHOUSE:
What is to be done, my dear Emma?—what is to be done?
---
## EMMA:
Oh, Papa!
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
Never fear. I took the liberty of inspecting the road—the snow is not above half an inch deep.
---
Perfectly safe for the carriages.
---
## EMMA:
Thank you, Mr. Knightley, what a great relief!
---
## MRS WESTON:
I suppose Mr. Weston and I must relinquish our guests before the snow grows worse.
---
## MR WOODHOUSE:
See to Miss and Mrs. Bates, Mr. Knightley.
---
## KNIGHTLEY:
Indeed, sir.
---
## MISS BATES:
How very exciting, mother.
---
## MR WESTON:
Good night to you all! Merry Christmas!
---
## MR WOODHOUSE:
Quickly, now, into the carriages, before the weather turns.
---
## EMMA
Well, Mr. Elton. Here we are
---
the weather seems not so grave.
---
## MR ELTON:
Miss Woodhouse, I must avail myself of this precious opportunity to declare the sentiments 
---
which must be already well known, ready to die if you refuse me.
---
## EMMA:
Mr. Elton! You forget yourself. Any message to Miss Smith I shall be happy to deliver, 
---
but no more of this to me, if you please.
---
## MR ELTON:
Miss Smith! What can you possibly mean! My ardent attachment to you...
---
## EMMA:
Mr. Elton, command yourself. After such behavior as I have witnessed to Miss Smith—
---
## MR ELTON:
Miss Smith! I never thought of Miss Smith in the whole course of my existence, but as your friend: 
---
never cared whether she were dead or alive, but as your friend. 
---
Everything that I have said or done has been with the sole view of marking my adoration of yourself. 
---
You can not really —I am sure you have understood me.
---
## EMMA:
No, sir, so far from having understood you, I have been in complete error till this moment. 
---
But, Am I to believe that you have never thought seriously of Harriet?
---
## MR ELTON:
I, think seriously of Miss Smith? 
---
I need not so totally despair of an equal alliance as to be addressing myself to Miss Smith! 
---
No, madam, my visits to Hartfield have been for yourself only; 
---
and the encouragement I received—
---
## EMMA:
Encouragement! Sir, you have been entirely mistaken. 
---
I have seen you only as the admirer of my friend. 
---
I have no thoughts of matrimony at present.
---
## MR ELTON:
I see.
---
## EMMA: aside
Oh! A wretched business!— poor Harriet! How could I have been so deceived? 
---
Mr. Elton commended Harriet's manners ... 
---
but gave me the credit. 
---
He praised her portrait ... 
---
that I had painted. 
---
Oh! Never has a person been more in error.
---
Harriet would never have thought of him but for me.
---
It was foolish to take part in bringing two people together. 
---
I am resolved to do such things no more. 
---
Oh, that I had been satisfied with persuading her not to accept Robert Martin. 
---
There I was quite right.... perhaps William Coxe would suit her— Oh. 
---
I have relapsed already.
---
I must confess to Harriet.
---
## EMMA:
I am so ashamed. I shall never be in charity with myself again.
---
## HARRIET:
I could never have deserved Mr. Elton
---
and nobody but so partial a friend as Miss Woodhouse would have thought it possible.
---
[weeping]
---
## EMMA:
Nonsense. Your deep feelings convince me that you are the superior creature. 
---
Mr. Elton, I understand, has gone away to Bath. I shall endeavor to prove my affection for you. 
---
You will visit Hartfield, we shall read five-volume novels -- I shall drive Mr. Elton from your thoughts. 
---
Upon his return, you will have quite forgotten him.
---
## HARRIET:
You are too kind.
---
## MRS WESTON:
Our fears have been justified. Frank Churchill will not visit us. He writes:
---
## FRANK:
For the present, I can not be spared by my Aunt Churchill, to my very great mortification; 
---
but I hope to visit at no distant period.
---
## MRS WESTON:
Mr. Weston and I are exceedingly disappointed.
---
## EMMA:
It appears, Mr. Knightley, that Frank Churchill's aunt has once again kept him from visiting his father. 
---
I am quite disappointed.
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
Are you?
---
## EMMA:
Yes. Frank Churchill would be such a nice addition to our confined society.
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
A man who felt rightly would say to Mrs. Churchill: 
---
Every sacrifice of mere pleasure you will always find me ready to make for you; but it is my duty to see my father and his bride immediately.
---
If he would say so there would be no opposition made to his going.
---
## EMMA
No, but perhaps there might be some made to his coming back again. 
---
Such language for a young man, entirely dependent, to use! Nobody but you, Mr. Knightley, would imagine it possible. 
---
He has written fine, satisfying letters to express his regrets.
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
I suspect they do not satisfy Mrs. Weston. It is on her account that attention is doubly due 
---
by Mr. Frank Churchill, and she must doubly feel the omission.
---
## EMMA:
You seem determined to think ill of him.
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
I am ready to acknowledge his merits; 
---
but I hear of none, except that he is good-looking with smooth manners.
---
## EMMA:
Well, if he has nothing else to recommend him, he will be a treasure in Highbury. 
---
We do not often look upon well-bred and agreeable young men.
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
Hm.
---
## EMMA:
We should talk of something else. I can not comprehend why you should be so angry.
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
Angry? Not at all..
---
## HARRIET:
Miss Woodhouse, I am determined to put Mr. Elton out of my mind.
---
## EMMA:
Quite right, ## HARRIET:. A walk in Highbury should divert you.
---
## HARRIET:
To be sure.  There is Mr. Elton's vicarage.
---
## EMMA:
Harriet, let us consider our forthcoming charity visits. Think what the poor must suffer in winter.
---
## HARRIET:
Mr. Elton is so good to the poor!
---
## EMMA:
Oh, look! The Bates's house. Shall we call upon them? 
---
As well as I can calculate, we are quite safe from any letter from Miss Bate's niece, Jane Hairfax. 
---
Miss Bates does love to read Miss Fairfax's letters aloud to her guests.
---
## HARRIET:
Are you acquainted with Miss Fairfax?
---
## EMMA:
Oh, yes; we are always forced to be acquainted whenever she comes to Highbury. 
---
Jane Fairfax is very accomplished. And elegant, remarkably elegant.
---
## MISS BATES:
Oh, Miss Woodhouse, Miss Smith, do sit down.
---
## HARRIET:
Thank you, Miss Bates, Mrs. Bates.
---
## MISS BATES:
Oh! - Cake?
---
Oh, my dear neighbor Mrs. Cole just called in and has heard from Mr. Elton in Bath, 
---
and what a favorite he is - dancing, you know.
---
## HARRIET:
Mr. Elton, dancing....
---
## MISS BATES:
Mrs. Cole kindly inquired after my niece Jane Fairfax, and said, 
---
`I know you can not have heard from Jane lately, because it is not her time for writing; 
---
and when I said, `But indeed we have, we had a letter this very morning, 
---
I do not know that I ever saw anybody more surprised. 
---
`Have you, said she; `well, that is quite unexpected.
---
## EMMA:
Have you heard from Miss Fairfax today?
---
## MISS BATES:
Yes – quite unforeseen. Oh! here is the letter:
---
## JANE FAIRFAX:
Dearest ones,
---
## MISS BATES:
—but first, I really must apologize for Jane writing so short a letter—only two pages you see—
---
But – Jane is coming to Highbury!
---
## EMMA:
Indeed? That must be a very great pleasure.
---
## MISS BATES:
You are very kind. Next week. Quite a surprise. Wasn't it, mother? We should not have had a
---
letter from her today if it had not been for this particular circumstance.
---
## JANE FAIRFAX:
Dearest ones, I –
---
## MISS BATES:
Jane is to be several months with us, as I will read to you. 
---
Oh, I have forgotten the cake – Oh, Miss Smith, perhaps you do not know her history. 
---
Jane's mother, my dear sister, and her father, died when Jane was but a child. 
---
A poor orphan. But family friends became her guardians and undertook the whole charge of her education. 
---
She has fallen into such good hands. Jane has now the education to find a situation as a governess.
---
## HARRIET:
Jane Fairfax has guardians, how nice.
---
## MISS BATES:
The case is, you see – have I offered you cake? 
---
Oh – did you hear of Jane's terrible adventure at the seaside in Weymouth? 
---
She and her guardians were with a party out on a sailing boat and Jane slipped 
---
and would have been dashed into the sea if this Irish gentleman had not caught hold of her gown. 
---
Imagine! I know his name is in her letter somewhere.
---
## EMMA:
An Irish stranger saved Miss Fairfax's life? 
---
Astonishing!
---
## MISS BATES:
Indeed! Most shocking. 
---
And then, Jane caught a bad cold, poor thing! 
---
During the holiday in Weymouth. 
---
A few months here in Highbury will entirely cure her, I am sure.
---
## EMMA:
It appears to be the most desirable arrangement in the world.
---
## MISS BATES:
Well, now I have just given you a hint of what Jane writes about, we will turn to her letter.
---
## JANE FAIRFAX:
Dearest ones, I have...

## MISS BATES:
Oh, and I have just remembered – there is cake.
---
## EMMA:
I am afraid we must take our leave, my father will be expecting us. 
---
We must wish you and Mrs. Bates good morning.
---
## MISS BATES:
Good morning!
---
## HARRIET:
Good morning!
---
## EMMA:
Well. Although we heard the whole substance of Jane Fairfax's letter, 
---
we were able to escape the letter itself.
---
## HARRIET:
To be sure.
---
## EMMA:
When she arrives next week I shall invite her to Hartfield. 
---
Perhaps I will warm to her on this occasion.
---
## EMMA:
Welcome back to Highbury, Miss Fairfax.
---
## JANE FAIRFAX:
Thank you, Miss Woodhouse.
---
## EMMA:
I hope you are recovering from your recent cold.
---
## JANE FAIRFAX:
Tolerably so.
---
## EMMA:
Did you enjoy Weymouth? I have never been to the seaside.
---
## JANE FAIRFAX:
Yes.
---
## EMMA:
I believe you met the mysterious Mr. Frank Churchill at Weymouth?
---
## JANE FAIRFAX:
We were a little acquainted.
---
## EMMA:
Was he handsome?
---
## JANE FAIRFAX:
I believe he was reckoned so.
---
## EMMA:
Did he appear sensible?
---
## JANE FAIRFAX:
I believe everybody found his manners pleasing.
---
## EMMA:
How unforgivably dissatisfying are her observations.
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
Last night was a particularly pleasant evening. 
---
You and Miss Fairfax gave us some very good music, Emma. 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
Having no instrument at her grandmother's, 
---
it must have been a real indulgence for Miss Fairfax.
---
## EMMA:
I am happy you approve, Mr. Knightley.
---
## MR WOODHOUSE:
You are sometimes, my dear, too attentive a hostess. 
---
## MR WOODHOUSE:
Too many muffins....
---
## EMMA:
Miss Fairfax is ... reserved.
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
A little. My dear Emma, had you not a pleasant evening?
---
## EMMA:
Oh, yes; I was pleased with my own perseverance in asking questions, 
---
## EMMA:
and amused to think how little information I obtained. 
---
## EMMA:
But I do pity her from my heart. She is an accomplished young woman, 
---
## EMMA:
yet she must soon earn her own bread as a governess.
---
## MR WOODHOUSE:
It is a great pity that the circumstances 
---
## MR WOODHOUSE:
of Mrs. and Miss Bates should be so confined, 
---
## MR WOODHOUSE:
especially with Miss Fairfax visiting. 
---
## MR WOODHOUSE:
Emma thinks of sending them a loin or a leg of our porker.
---
## EMMA:
My dear Papa, I sent the whole hind-quarter. I knew you would wish it.
---
## MR WOODHOUSE:
That's right, my dear, very right.
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
Generous as usual, Emma. 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
Ah! I have a piece of news for you. You like news—
---
## EMMA:
News! Oh! yes, I always like news. 
---
## EMMA:
What is it? Why do you smile so?
---
## MISS BATES:
Mr. Woodhouse! Miss Woodhouse! Oh! 
---
## MISS BATES:
My dear sir, how are you this morning? 
---
## MISS BATES:
My dear Miss Woodhouse— I come quite over-powered. 
---
## MISS BATES:
Such a beautiful hind-quarter of pork! 
---
## MISS BATES:
You are too bountiful! 
---
## MISS BATES:
As my mother says, our friends are only too good to us. 
---
## MISS BATES:
Would you not say so, Jane? 
---
## MISS BATES:
Oh - Have you heard the news? 
---
## MISS BATES:
Mr. Elton is going to be married.
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
There is my news.
---
## MISS BATES:
A Miss Hawkins of Bath.
---
## EMMA:
Mr. Elton to be married!
---
## MISS BATES:
She has an independent fortune, I hear. 
---
## MISS BATES:
A new neighbor for us all, Miss Woodhouse! 
---
## MISS BATES:
Oh, Jane, I am sure that you have a curiosity to see him 
---
## MISS BATES:
as you have never met Mr. Elton.
---
## JANE FAIRFAX:
No, I have not.
---
## MISS BATES:
Soon it will be Mr. and Mrs. Elton; 
---
## MISS BATES:
And he gone just four weeks. Miss Woodhouse lets me chatter on, so good-humoredly. 
---
## MISS BATES:
Well, my dear Jane, I believe we must be running away. The weather looks like rain again. 
---
## MISS BATES:
Oh! Mr. Knightley is coming, too, mother. How nice. Good morning to you.
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
Good morning, Mr. Woodhouse, Emma.
---
## MR WOODHOUSE:
Poor Mr. Elton – engaged to be married
---
## MR. WOODHOUSE:
such sad changes.
---
## EMMA:
How shall I ever break the news to ## HARRIET:?
---
## HARRIET:
Oh! Miss Woodhouse, what do you think has happened! 
---
## HARRIET:
It began to rain, and I took shelter in a shop. And who should come in, 
---
## HARRIET:
but Robert Martin and his sister! I thought I should have fainted. 
---
## HARRIET:
He spoke, very amiably, "Good day, Miss Smith,"
---
## HARRIET:
and I answered, "Good day, Mr. Robert Martin,"
---
## HARRIET:
then he said, "if you are going to Hartfield, you had much better go the long way round 
---
## HARRIET:
by the stables, for you shall find the near way quite flooded by this rain." 
---
## HARRIET:
So I said,"I am very much obliged to you." 
---
## HARRIET:
Oh! Miss Woodhouse, I am so distressed: 
---
## HARRIET:
and yet, you know, he behaved so pleasantly. 
---
## HARRIET:
Oh! Miss Woodhouse!
---
## EMMA:
Harriet, you have behaved extremely well; and it is over
---
## EMMA:
a first meeting can not occur again,
---
## EMMA:
and therefore you need not think about it.
---
## HARRIET:
Very true. I will not think about it. 
---
## HARRIET:
It was so friendly of him to warn me of the puddles.
---
## EMMA:
Harriet, I have some difficult news: 
---
## EMMA:
Mr. Elton is engaged to be married.

## HARRIET
Mr. Elton—! Oh, dear. 
---
## HARRIET
And Mr. Robert Martin. Oh, dear. 
---
## HARRIET
I am so miserable. This day will be the death of me!
---
## EMMA
Oh, Harriet, how you must suffer.
---
## MR WESTON:
Sudden news: Frank arrives tomorrow! 
---
## MR WESTON:
And stays for a fortnight! I knew he would come. 
---
## MR WESTON:
I shall bring him to Hartfield to meet you, Miss Woodhouse.
---
## FRANK:
My father's marriage was the wisest measure, every friend must rejoice in it. 
---
## FRANK:
Miss Woodhouse, Mrs. Weston was your governess, was she not?
---
## EMMA:
Indeed she was.
---
## FRANK:
Elegant manners I was prepared for, 
---
## FRANK:
but I did not know that I was to find a pretty young woman in Mrs. Weston.
---
## EMMA:
You can not see too much perfection in Mrs. Weston for my feelings.
---
## FRANK:
I would be obliged to you to hear more about the neighborhood. 
---
## FRANK:
Is there music? Dancing? Pleasant society? 
---
## FRANK:
I do have the honor of being acquainted with a neighbor of yours, 
---
## FRANK:
a family of the name of Fairfax–
---
## EMMA:
You met Miss Jane Fairfax at Weymouth, did you not? 
---
## EMMA:
She is staying with her grandmother and aunt – the Bates family.
---
## FRANK:
Father has business in Highbury, perhaps I really should.
---
## MR WESTON:
Call upon them, by all means, Frank!
---
## FRANK:
Until tomorrow, Miss Woodhouse?
---
## EMMA:
Until tomorrow, then.
---
## EMMA:
What an agreeable young man.
---
## FRANK:
Mrs. Weston, I must say that Highbury is a cheerful-looking place.
---
## MRS WESTON:
Thank you, Frank. This is the Crown Inn. 
---
## MRS. WESTON:
That new addition was built many years ago for a Ball- room, 
---
## MRS. WESTON:
but such brilliant days have long passed away.
---
## FRANK:
We ought to have Balls there every fortnight. 
---
## FRANK:
Miss Woodhouse, why have you not revived the former good old days of the room? 
---
## FRANK:
You who could do anything in Highbury!
---
## MRS WESTON:
You argue like a young man very much bent on dancing.
---
## EMMA:
He is like his father, full of lively spirits.
---
## MRS WESTON:
Oh! Miss Bickerton! 
---
## MRS. WESTON:
Pray, continue your conversation without me.
---
## EMMA:
Did you pay your visit to the Bateses and Miss Fairfax?
---
## FRANK:
Oh! Yes. 
---
## FRANK:
The talking aunt took me quite by surprise.
---
## EMMA:
She often takes one by surprise.
---
## EMMA:
Did you see Miss Fairfax often at Weymouth?
---
## FRANK:
It is the lady's right to decide on the degree of acquaintance.
---
## EMMA:
Her account leaves much to be guessed.
---
## FRANK:
Indeed? I met her frequently at Weymouth. 
---
## FRANK:
I had known her guardians a little in town. 
---
## FRANK:
I like them all.
---
## EMMA:
I understand that Miss Fairfax must soon find a position as a governess.
---
## FRANK:
Indeed?
---
## EMMA:
A respectable living, being a governess. 
---
## EMMA:
But one must wonder if she anticipates it with eagerness.
---
## FRANK:
Hm. Indeed. Did you ever hear Miss Fairfax play the pianoforte?
---
## EMMA:

I have heard her play every year of our lives since we both began. 
---
## EMMA:
She plays charmingly.
---
## FRANK:
You think so? 
---
## FRANK:
At Weymouth, a very musical man seemed to like to Miss Fairfax's playing 
---
## FRANK:
rather more than his own wife's.
---
## EMMA:
That would be her guardian? 
---
## EMMA:
We shall know more in half an hour from you than Miss Fairfax would have vouchsafed in half a year.
---
## FRANK:
Yes, her guardians were the persons; 
---
## FRANK:
and I thought it a very strong proof of Miss Fairfax's musical abilities.
---
## EMMA:
I wonder at Miss Fairfax's feelings regarding such praise.
---
## FRANK:
As to that—I do not—but you have known Miss Fairfax from childhood.
---
## EMMA:
I regret to say we have never taken to each other. 
## EMMA:
On my side—I never could attach myself to anyone so reserved.
---
## FRANK:
A disagreeable quality, indeed. 
---
## FRANK:
One can not love a reserved person. In fact, Miss Fairfax is
---
particularly timid and silent ... as though she held a secret.
---
## EMMA:
Oh.
---
## EMMA:
Frank Churchill is rather dashing. 
---
## EMMA:
Or is it all nonsense? I am very much disposed to like him.
---
## MISS BATES:
Mother and I have just heard – the Coles are hosting a party!
---
## EMMA:
Why, Mr. Knightley. You have taken a carriage! 
---
## EMMA:
You are too apt to insist upon walking everywhere. 
---
## EMMA:
This is arriving like a gentleman.
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
If we had met first in the drawing room, 
---
## FRANK:
I doubt whether you would have discerned me to be
more of a gentleman than usual.
---
## EMMA:
Yes, I should. There is always a self-consciousness when people arrive 
---
## EMMA:
in a way which they know to be beneath them. You think you carry it off well, 
---
## EMMA:
I dare say, but you adopt a sort of air of affected unconcern.
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY::
Nonsense!
---
## EMMA:
Now I shall really be happy to walk into the same room with you.
---
## MISS BATES:
and what do you think arrived in our sitting room? 
---
## MISS BATES:
A pianoforte – for Jane—imagine! 
---
## MISS BATES:
Jane was quite bewildered to think who could possibly have ordered it 
---
## MISS BATES:
of course it must be from her guardians. 
---
## MISS BATES:
But Jane had a letter from them, and not a word was said about it, was it mother?
---
## EMMA:
Mr. Frank Churchill, why do you smile?
---
## FRANK:
Nay, why do you?
---
## EMMA:
I smile because you smile. 
---
## EMMA:
For the handsome present Miss Fairfax has received from her guardians. 
---
## EMMA:
The pianoforte.
---
## FRANK:
Her guardians? Hmmm.
---
## EMMA:
We know they admire her performance.
---
## FRANK:
Yes, but—I can not help suspecting that,
---
## FRANK:
did you hear of the sailing party incident at Weymouth.
---
## EMMA:
Oh! The Irish gentlemen!
---
## EMMA:
Miss Fairfax was falling overboard. He saved her life.
---
## FRANK
The married Irish gentleman. 
---
## FRANK:
I was there, you see!
---
## EMMA:
Were you really?
---
## FRANK:
Yes, and I can not help suspecting that
---
## FRANK:
this married Irishman has had the misfortune to fall in love with Miss Fairfax. 
---
## FRANK:
That must be the true cause for Miss Fairfax coming to Highbury.
---
## FRANK:
A secret love.
---
## EMMA:
It would be quite an event for a young man and a young woman. 
---
## EMMA:
A rescue at sea! And now this pianoforte arrives. 
---
## EMMA:
But we must not presume or gossip. 
---
## EMMA:
We shall soon hear that it is a present from her guardians.
---
## FRANK:
And I am perfectly convinced that the mysterious Irish suitor 
---
## FRANK:
is the principal in the business. Hm.
---
## EMMA:
What is the matter?
---
## FRANK:
Miss Fairfax has done her hair in so odd a way.
---
## FRANK:
I must go and ask her whether it is an Irish fashion.
---
## EMMA:
Is that wise? No, do not.
---
## EMMA:
Well, Harriet, what do you think of our Mr. Frank Churchill?
---
## HARRIET:
I think he looks a little like Mr. Elton. 
---
## MRS WESTON:
My dear Emma.
---
## EMMA:
Ah, Mrs. Weston!
---
## MRS WESTON:
Do you know how Miss Bates and Jane Fairfax were conveyed hither? 
---
## MRS WESTON:
They arrived in Mr. Knightley's carriage. 
---
## MRS WESTON:
I am inclined to think that the carriage was used as an excuse for assisting them.
---
## EMMA:
I did wonder why Mr. Knightly arrived by carriage. 
---
## EMMA:
But it is precisely like Mr. Knightley to do that sort of thing,
---
## EMMA:
useful and considerate.
---
## MRS WESTON:
Well, a suspicion has darted into my head.
---
## MRS WESTON:
I have made a match between Mr. Knightley and Jane
Fairfax. 
---
## MRS WESTON:
What do you say to it?
---
## EMMA:
Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax! 
---
## EMMA:
Oh, no! His good-nature would be quite enough to account for the carriage. 
---
## EMMA:
He has a great regard for the Bateses, 
---
## EMMA:
independent of Jane Fairfax. 
---
## EMMA:
My dear Mrs. Weston, do not take to match-making; 
---
## EMMA:
you do it very ill. Jane Fairfax? 
---
## EMMA:
Oh! no, no, no!
---
## MRS WESTON:
Excepting inequality of fortune, 
---
## MRS WESTON:
I can see nothing unsuitable.
---
## EMMA:
But Mr. Knightley does not want to marry. 
---
## EMMA:
Why should he marry? 
---
## EMMA:
He is happy by himself; with his farm, and his sheep, and his library.
---
## MRS WESTON:
I have heard him speak very highly of Jane Fairfax. 
---
## MRS WESTON:
His anxiety about her health, his concern for her prospects, 
---
## MRS WESTON:
such an admirer of her performance. 
---
## MRS WESTON:
Oh! The pianoforte has been sent to Jane Fairfax by somebody
---
## MRS WESTON:
may it not be from Mr. Knightley?
---
## EMMA:
Mr. Knightley does nothing mysteriously.
---
## MRS WESTON:
There might be scruples of delicacy, my dear Emma.
---
## EMMA:
I see no sign of attachment.
---
## EMMA:
I believe nothing of the pianoforte
---
## EMMA:
and only proof shall convince me 
---
## EMMA:
that Mr. Knightley has any thought of marrying Jane Fairfax.
---
## MISS BATES:
Oh, Miss Woodhouse, do sing for us!
---
## MR WESTON:
Yes, Miss Woodhouse, let me entreat you as well.
---
## EMMA:
I shall comply.
---
## MISS BATES:
Oh, music, mother!

Oh! Mr. Frank Churchill sings!

## MISS BATES:
This is brilliant. I am all amazement!

And now Miss Fairfax, if you please!
---
## FRANK:
Miss Fairfax and I sang together at Weymouth, 
---
## FRANK:
did we not, Miss Fairfax.

Once or twice, I believe.

The gift of the pianoforte to Miss Fairfax

## EMMA:
very kind of Miss Fairfax's guardians.

## MR KNIGHTLEY:
Indeed.

## MR KNIGHTLEY:
But surprises are foolish things. 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
The pleasure is not enhanced, 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
and the inconvenience is often considerable.
---
## EMMA: 
Exactly as I thought. 
---
## EMMA:
No mysterious surprises from our Mr. Knightley.

## JANE FAIRFAX:
coughs
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
She has sung quite enough for one evening.
---
## FRANK:
I think you could manage one more song without effort.
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
That fellow thinks of nothing but showing off his own voice. 
---
## MR KNIGHTLY:
Miss Bates, do not let your niece sing herself hoarse in this manner.
---
## MISS BATES:
Jane! Jane, dear! 
---
## MISS BATES:
Perhaps you should rest your voice now.
---
## MRS WESTON:
Notice Mr. Knightley's concern for Jane's health.
---
## HARRIET:
Oh, Miss Woodhouse, the singing last night! 
---
## HARRIET:
If I could but sing as well as you and Miss Fairfax.
---
## EMMA:
Harriet, my singing is no more like hers 
---
## EMMA:
than a lamp is like sunshine.
---
## HARRIET:
I think you sing quite as well as she does.
---
## MISS BATES:
My dear Miss Woodhouse, 
---
## MISS BATES:
may I entreat you to give us your opinion 
---
## MISS BATES:
of the new pianoforte; you and Miss Smith. 
---
## MISS BATES:
How do you do, Miss Smith. 
---
## MISS BATES:
What was I talking of? 
---
## MISS BATES:
Oh! The pianoforte!
---
## MISS BATES:
Mr. Frank Churchill is here, 
---
## MISS BATES:
and he is, in the most obliging manner in the world, 
---
## MISS BATES:
fastening in the rivet of my mother's spectacles.
---
## MISS BATES:
This is a pleasure! 
---
## MISS BATES:
Jane, dear, do play us something!
---
## JANE FAIRFAX:
As you wish, Aunt.
---
template: music
---
## FRANK:
Your guardians have chosen an excellent instrument. 
---
## FRANK:
Do you not think so, Miss Fairfax?
---
## EMMA:
Do not distress her.
---
## FRANK:
Your guardians must be enjoying your pleasure 
---
## FRANK:
on this occasion, Miss Fairfax.
---
## JANE FAIRFAX:
Till I have a letter from them, 
---
## JANE FAIRFAX:
it must be all conjecture.
---
## FRANK:
Delightfully played, Miss Fairfax. 
---
## FRANK:
Perhaps an Irish melody next?
---
## EMMA:
You speak too plain. 
---
## EMMA:
She must understand you.
---
## FRANK:
I hope she does. 
---
## FRANK:
I am not in the least ashamed of my meaning.
---
## EMMA:
But I am half ashamed, 
---
## EMMA:
and wish I had never taken up the idea.
---
## MISS BATES:
Mr. Knightley, I declare! 
---
## MISS BATES:
How d' ye do, Mr. Knightley! 
---
## MISS BATES:
So obliged to you for the carriage last night. 
---
## MISS BATES:
Pray come in.
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
How is your niece, Miss Bates? 
---
## MR KNIGHTLY:
I hope she caught no cold last night.
---
## MISS BATES:
She is in excellent health, Mr. Knightley. 
---
## MISS BATES:
But do come in. 
---
## MISS BATES:
Who do you think is here? 
---
## MISS BATES:
Miss Woodhouse and Miss Smith.
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
Well, for five minutes, perhaps.
---
## MISS BATES:
And here is Mr. Frank Churchill, too! 
---
## MISS BATES:
So many friends!
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
Ah, no, not now, I thank you.
---
## MR KNIGHTLY:
I must get on to Kingston. 
---
## MR KNIGHTLY:
I will call another day.
---
## MISS BATES:
Well, I am sorry! 
---
## MISS BATES:
Well, Mr. Knightley can not stop. 
---
## MISS BATES:
He is going to Kingston. He asked me
---
## JANE FAIRFAX:
Yes, Aunt, we heard everything.
---
## MISS BATES:
Oh! yes, my dear, 
---
## MISS BATES:
I dare say you might, because you know, the window was open, 
---
## MISS BATES:
and Mr. Knightley spoke loud.
---
## FRANK:
Ah, this music. 
---
## FRANK:
I long for a dance. 
---
## FRANK:
I suppose it may be possible 
---
## FRANK:
to do without dancing entirely, but I am unconvinced.
---
## EMMA
Instances have been known of young people 
---
## EMMA:
passing many months successively 
---
## EMMA:
without being at any Ball of any description.
---
## FRANK:
Is that so? 
---
## FRANK:
And no material injury accrued, either to body or mind?
---
## EMMA:
None whatever.
---
## FRANK:
Sounds suspicious. 
---
## FRANK:
Do you not think so, Miss Smith?
---
## HARRIET:
Oh! Perhaps. I...
---
## FRANK:
Miss Fairfax?
---
## JANE FAIRFAX:
I know nothing of the matter.
---
## MRS WESTON:
A letter arrived today. 
---
## MRS WESTON:
Frank's aunt, Mrs. Churchill, is unwell
---
## MRS WESTON:
far too unwell to do without him; 
---
## MRS WESTON:
she entreats him to return to Yorkshire without delay. 
---
## MRS WESTON:
Frank will leave us.
---
## FRANK:
Of all horrid things, leave-taking is the worst.
---
## EMMA:
But you will come again.
---
## FRANK:
I shall try for it with zeal! 
---
## FRANK:
But I am afraid there are family tempers to manage, 
---
## FRANK:
you see, I am dependent on my Aunt Churchill's good graces.
---
## FRANK:
I have no independence in my own future.
---
## FRANK:
I fear she will keep me away to tend to her illnesses.
---
## EMMA:
And you must be off this very morning?
---
## FRANK:
Yes, immediately.
---
## EMMA:
Not five minutes to spare for your friends 
---
## EMMA:
Miss Fairfax and Miss Bates?
---
## FRANK:
Oh. Yes, I have called there already, 
---
## FRANK:
to Miss Fairfax and the Bateses. 
---
## FRANK:
I thought it a right thing to do. 
---
## FRANK:
In short, perhaps, Miss Woodhouse, 
---
## FRANK:
I think you can hardly be without suspicion
---
## FRANK:
my affections
---
## FRANK:
my deepest feelings...
---
## EMMA:
For all of Highbury, of course!
---
## FRANK:
[sighs]
---
## FRANK:
I must go. 
---
## FRANK:
I shall hear about you all from Mrs. Weston, 
---
## FRANK:
that is my chief consolation.
---
## FRANK:
Good-bye.
---
## EMMA:
Do you think he was about to confess his love for me?
---
## EMMA:
I think I must be a little in love with Mr. Frank Churchill.
---
## EMMA:
On the other hand, I am not particularly unhappy, 
---
## EMMA:
so perhaps I am only a very little in love.
---
## EMMA:
If I imagine a declaration on his side, I would refuse him. 
---
## EMMA:
I can not be very much in love, can I? 
---
## EMMA:
I do suspect that he is not really necessary to my happiness. 
---
## EMMA:
So much the better. 
---
## EMMA:
I am not in love with Mr. Frank Churchill.
---
## EMMA:
He is undoubtedly very much in love with me! 
---
## EMMA:
And when he comes again, I must be on my guard not to encourage him.
---
## MRS WESTON:
I have had a letter from Frank. 
---
## MRS WESTON:
He expresses affection and gratitude to us all. 
---
## MRS WESTON:
And he writes:
---
## FRANK:
I had not a spare moment for Miss Woodhouses beautiful little friend. 
---
## FRANK:
Pray make my excuses and adieus to Miss Smith.
---
## EMMA:
Ah! He calls Harriet the 
"beautiful little friend."
---
## EMMA:
Might Harriet succeed me in his affections? 
---
## EMMA:
I must not dwell upon it. 
---
## EMMA:
I know the danger of indulging such speculations. 
---
## EMMA:
But stranger things have happened.

**ACT TWO**
---
## MISS BATES:
Mr. and Mrs. Elton have arrived in Highbury! 
---
## MISS BATES:
Mother, do you see Mrs. Elton? No, over there mother..
---
## MR ELTON:
My dear Augusta.
---
## MRS ELTON:
My dear Mr. E..
---
## HARRIET:
Oh, Miss Woodhouse. 
---
## HARRIET:
It is Mr. and Mrs. Elton.
---
## EMMA:
Poor Harriet. 
---
## EMMA:
It is not worthwhile to think about them.
---
## HARRIET:
You are right. 
---
## HARRIET:
I shall think of Mr. and Mrs. Elton no longer! 
---
## HARRIET:
Mr. and Mrs. Elton. 
---
## HARRIET:
Oh!
---
## EMMA:
Harriet, your tenderness of heart will prove invaluable when you marry.
---
## EMMA:
I mention no names.
---
## EMMA:
In the meanwhile, I must welcome Mrs. Elton to the neighborhood.
---
## MRS ELTON:
Hartfield is such a lovely home, Mr. Woodhouse.
---
## MR WOODHOUSE:
Thank you, Mrs. Elton. We –
---
## MRS ELTON:
So like Maple Grove, 
---
## MRS ELTON:
my brother-in-law, Mr. Suckling's seat. 
---
## MRS ELTON:
Is it not astonishingly like Maple Grove, Mr. E?
---
## MR ELTON
Yes, I...
---
## MRS ELTON:
Even the grounds are strikingly like. 
---
## MRS ELTON:
The laurels at Maple Grove are in the same profusion as here.
---
## EMMA:
When you have seen more of this county, 
---
## EMMA:
I am afraid you will think you have overrated
Hartfield.
---
## MRS ELTON:
Oh! Surrey is the garden of England.
---
## EMMA:
Yes; but we must not rest our claims on that distinction. 
---
## EMMA:
Many counties, I believe, are called the garden of England.
---
## MRS ELTON:
No, I fancy not. 
---
## MRS ELTON:
I never heard any county but Surrey called so.
---
## EMMA:
Ah. Mrs. Elton your reputation as a superior musician precedes you.
---
## MRS ELTON:
Oh, no, I must protest.
---
## MRS ELTON:
I am passionately fond of music; 
---
## MRS ELTON:
and my friends say I am not entirely devoid of taste. 
---
## MRS ELTON:
I have been used to a very musical society at Maple Grove with Mr. and Mrs. Suckling. 
---
## MRS ELTON:
I think, Miss Woodhouse, you and I must establish a musical club.
---
## EMMA:
Perhaps...
---
## MRS ELTON:
Oh! We have called upon Mr. and Mrs. Weston
---
## MRS ELTON:
very pleasant people. Mrs. Weston was your governess, I think? 
---
## MRS ELTON:
I was rather astonished to find her so very lady-like.
---
## EMMA:
Mrs. Weston's manners were always particularly good. 
---
## EMMA:
Their propriety and elegance would make them the safest model for any young woman.
---
## MRS ELTON:
And who do you think came in while we were there? 
---
## MRS ELTON:
Knightley himself! 
---
## MRS ELTON:
Mr. E has so often mentioned 
'My friend Knightley' 
---
## MRS ELTON:
and I must say he need not be ashamed of his friend. 
---
## MRS ELTON:
Knightley is quite the gentleman.
---
## MR WOODHOUSE:
Well, my dear, 
---
## MR WOODHOUSE:
I dare say she was very much pleased with you. 
---
## MR WOODHOUSE:
She speaks a little too quick, however, which rather hurts the ear.
---
## EMMA:
Insufferable woman! 
---
## EMMA:
Knightley! 
---
## EMMA:
Never seen him in her life before, and call him Knightley! 
---
## EMMA:
A vulgar being, with her 
"Mr. E," 
---
## EMMA:
and all her pretension. 
---
## EMMA:
Actually to discover that Mr. Knightley is a gentleman! 
---
## EMMA:
And Mrs. Weston! 
---
## EMMA:
Astonished that the person who had brought me up should be a gentlewoman! 
---
## EMMA:
Harriet is her superior in every way.
---
## MRS ELTON:
Jane Fairfax is absolutely charming, Miss Woodhouse. 
---
## MRS ELTON:
I quite rave about Jane Fairfax. 
---
## MRS ELTON:
And with such talents! 
---
## MRS ELTON:
Oh! And her situation is so calculated to affect one! 
---
## MRS ELTON:
Miss Woodhouse, we must exert ourselves 
---
## MRS ELTON:
and endeavor to do something for her.
---
## EMMA:
You appear to feel a great deal...
---
## MRS ELTON:
Oh! I assure you, Jane Fairfax interests me more than I can express. 
---
## MRS ELTON:
I shall certainly have musical parties to draw out her talents, 
---
## MRS ELTON:
and shall be constantly on the watch for an eligible situation as governess.
---
## EMMA:
Poor Jane Fairfax! 
---
## EMMA:
She has not deserved this. 
---
## EMMA:
She may have done wrong with regard to her married Irish suitor, 
---
## EMMA:
but this is a punishment beyond what she has merited: 
---
## EMMA:
the kindness and protection of Mrs. Elton!
---
## MRS ELTON:
Dear Jane!
---
## MRS ELTON:
You shall spend the day with me!
---
## MISS BATES:
Oh, Miss Woodhouse, 
---
## MISS BATES:
Mrs. Elton is too kind to Jane. 
---
## MISS BATES:
Jane is now always sitting with the Eltons,
---
## MISS BATES:
walking with the Eltons, dining with the Eltons.
---
## JANE FAIRFAX:
Indeed, Mrs. Elton is very kind. 
---
## JANE FAIRFAX:
Quite ... deliberate in her attentions.
---
## MRS ELTON:
Please do not mention it. 
---
## MRS ELTON:
Jane is a delightful character! 
---
## MRS ELTON:
Jane, I must find you a situation as governess in a suitable family.
---
## JANE FAIRFAX:
You are very obliging, Mrs. Elton, 
---
## JANE FAIRFAX:
but I do not wish to make any inquiries until after mid-summer.
---
## MRS ELTON:
Nonsense, Jane. 
---
## MRS ELTON:
Come along to tea and we will discuss this further.
---
## MISS BATES:
Tea with Mrs. Elton, mother!
---
## EMMA:
Jane Fairfax is quite a riddle. 
---
## EMMA:
Mrs. Weston, why does she submit to Mrs. Elton's invitations?
---
## MRS WESTON:
One can not be always at home. 
---
## MRS WESTON:
Her aunt is a good creature, 
---
## MRS WESTON:
but as a constant companion might be a bit tiresome.
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
She receives consideration from Mrs. Elton which nobody else pays her.
---
## EMMA:
I see your meaning, Mr. Knightley. 
---
## EMMA:
She has had every advantage of discipline and culture, 
---
## EMMA:
but not the affectionate family and intimate friends as I have.
---
## MRS WESTON:
Perhaps, my dear, you see in Jane Fairfax 
---
## MRS WESTON:
the really accomplished young woman which you want to be thought yourself.
---
## EMMA:
Perhaps. 
---
## EMMA:
I do always seem to be doing more for her than I wish, 
---
## EMMA:
but less than I ought. I ought to have been more her friend. 
---
## EMMA:
I am determined to show her greater attention than I have done.
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
Well said, Emma.
---
## EMMA:
I know how highly you think of Jane Fairfax.
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
Yes, anybody may know how highly I think of her.
---
## EMMA:
And yet ... and yet, 
---
## EMMA:
perhaps, the extent of your admiration may take you by surprise some day.
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
Oh, are you matchmaking again? 
---
## MR KNIGHTLY:
Miss Fairfax, I dare say, would not have me if I were to ask her, 
---
## MR KNIGHTLY:
and I am very sure I shall never ask her.
---
## EMMA:
You are not vain, Mr. Knightley. 
---
## EMMA:
I will say that for you.
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
So you have been settling that I should marry Jane Fairfax?
---
## EMMA:
No, upon my word 
---
## EMMA:
I have not the smallest wish for your marrying Jane Fairfax or Jane anybody.
---
## EMMA:
You would not come and visit with us in this comfortable way, 
---
## EMMA:
if you were married.

## MR KNIGHTLEY
I converse with Jane Fairfax with pleasure, 
---
## MR KNIGHTLY:
but with no thought beyond, I assure you. 
---
## MR KNIGHTLY:
Good day.
---
## EMMA:
Well, Mrs. Weston, 
---
## EMMA:
what do you say now to Mr. Knightley's marrying Jane Fairfax?
---
## MRS WESTON:
I say that he is so very occupied 
---
## MRS WESTON:
by the idea of not being in love with her, 
---
## MRS WESTON:
that perhaps it will end with his being so at last.
---
## MR WESTON:
I have a letter from Frank. 
---
## MR WESTON:
He is returning to Highbury! 
---
## MR WESTON:
He writes that the whole Churchill family is to move southward 
---
## MR WESTON:
for the sake of Mrs. Churchill's health.
---
## MRS ELTON:
He will find an addition to the society of Highbury; 
---
## MRS ELTON:
that is, if I may presume to call myself an addition.
---
## MRS WESTON
Emma, Frank has arrived.
---
## FRANK:
Miss Woodhouse, I am so pleased to see you. 
---
## FRANK:
I have only a short time. 
---
## FRANK:
My aunt is in a weak state, and can not bear my absence for long. 
---
## FRANK:
But we are ensconced in Richmond, only nine miles away. 
---
## FRANK:
Forgive me, but I must hurry away to make other calls in Highbury.
---
## EMMA:
But, Frank –
---
## FRANK:
I saw a group of old acquaintance in the street, Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax
---
## FRANK:
and I have the vanity to think they would be disappointed if I did not call, 
---
## FRANK:
I must hurry off. Oh! Miss Woodhouse
---
## FRANK:
my father has agreed to host a Ball!
---
## EMMA:
A Ball! How wonderful!
---
## FRANK:
No misfortune must occur to prevent it! 
---
## MRS WESTON:
I am sorry Frank's visit was so short, Emma. 
---
## MRS WESTON:
Quite disappointing, my dear. 
---
## MRS WESTON:
But, with a Ball arranged, a very few tomorrows stand between 
---
## MRS WESTON:
the young people of Highbury and happiness.
---
## EMMA:
Such a short visit. 
---
## EMMA:
He is clearly less in love than he had been. 
---
## EMMA:
A very desirable effect. Might his affections transfer to Harriet? 
---
## EMMA:
Not a word from me, however.
--- 
## MR WESTON:
A Ball! Dancing! Capital!
---
## FRANK:
I have a great curiosity to meet the famous Mrs. Elton. 
---
## FRANK:
I think she must be here soon.
---
## EMMA:
I believe the Elton's are bringing Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax as well.
---
## FRANK:
Indeed? Miss Bates must not be forgotten. 
---
## FRANK:
I will see to their carriage. 
---
## FRANK:
Pray, excuse me.
---
## EMMA:
Well, Harriet, we shall see if Mr. Frank Churchill 
---
## EMMA:
is as skilled at dancing as he is besotted with it.
---
## HARRIET:
Will Mr. Knightley be dancing?
---
## EMMA:
Alas, no. Mr. Knightley takes no pleasure in dancing. 
---
## EMMA:
He is classing himself with the whist-players.
---
## HARRIET:
He looks too young to be among them.
---
## EMMA:
Of course he could not appear to greater advantage anywhere, 
---
## EMMA:
his tall figure among the stooping shoulders of the elderly men. 
---
## EMMA:
His every step proves with what natural grace he must dance, 
---
## EMMA:
would he but take the trouble.
---
## MISS BATES:
So very obliging of you, Mr. Frank Churchill!
---
## MRS ELTON:
So truly the gentleman.
---
## MISS BATES:
Well! This is brilliant indeed! 
---
## MISS BATES:
Upon my word. Jane, 
---
## MISS BATES:
Jane, look—did you ever see anything—? 
---
## MISS BATES:
Oh! Mr. Weston, this is excellently contrived. 
---
## MISS BATES:
Mrs. Elton arranged for a carriage. 
---
## MISS BATES:
Never were such neighbors. 
---
## MISS BATES:
I said to my mother, 
---
## MISS BATES:
'Upon my word, mother' 
---
## MISS BATES:
Oh! Mr. Frank Churchill, 
---
## MISS BATES:
I must tell you my mother's spectacles 
---
## MISS BATES:
have never been in fault since you repaired them. 
---
## MISS BATES:
Mother often talks of your good-nature. 
---
## MISS BATES:
Does she not, Jane? 
---
## MISS BATES:
Ah! Miss Woodhouse, 
---
## MISS BATES:
this is meeting quite in fairy-land! 
---
## MISS BATES:
Miss Woodhouse, how do you like Jane's hair? 
---
## MISS BATES:
She did it all herself.
---
## EMMA:
Miss Fairfax, your hair does indeed look lovely.
---
## JANE FAIRFAX:
Thank you, Miss Woodhouse.
---
## MISS BATES:
Oh – tea! 
---
## MRS ELTON:
How do you like my gown, Miss Fairfax?
---
## JANE FAIRFAX:
It is beautiful, Mrs. Elton.
---
## MRS ELTON:
Nobody can think less of dress than I do, 
---
## MRS ELTON:
but in compliment to the Westons, 
---
## MRS ELTON:
I see very few pearls in the room except mine. 
---
## MRS ELTON:
Come along, Jane, Mr. Elton will begin to be impatient for us.
---
## EMMA:
Oh, Miss Fairfax, it seems your aunt has your shawl. 
---
## EMMA:
Over there. 
---
## MRS ELTON:
Be sure to join us later, Jane.
---
## JANE FAIRFAX:
You are very kind, Miss Woodhouse. 
---
## JANE FAIRFAX:
Very kind, indeed. 
---
## EMMA:
How do you like Mrs. Elton?
---
## FRANK:
Not at all. 
---
## FRANK:
She called Miss Fairfax "Jane!" 
---
## FRANK:
That is too familiar. 
---
## FRANK:
May I have the first dance, Miss Woodhouse. 
---
## FRANK:
Otherwise I may be required to dance with Mrs. Elton.
---
## EMMA:
With pleasure. 
---
## EMMA:
Oh, dear. Harriet has no partner.
---
## MRS WESTON:
Mr. Elton, do not you dance?
---
## MR ELTON
Most readily, Mrs. Weston, 
---
## MR ELTON:
if you will dance with me.
---
## MRS WESTON:
Me!—oh, no—I would get you a better partner than myself—Miss Smith.
---
## MR ELTON:
Miss Smith!—oh!—I had not observed— 
---
## MR ELTON:
and if I were not an old married man—But my dancing days are over. 
---
## MR ELTON:
You will excuse me. 
---
## EMMA
Mr. Knightley, I must thank you for the kindness you showed to Harriet.
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
Mr. Elton was unpardonably rude to her. 
---
## MR KNIGHTLY:
I presume your match-making between Miss Smith and
Mr. Elton was the cause?
---
## EMMA
Yes. I was fully convinced of his being in love with Harriet, 
---
## EMMA:
through a series of strange blunders of my own making. 
---
## EMMA:
But I have been completely mistaken in Mr. Elton's character.
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
You would have chosen for him better than he has chosen for himself. 
---
## MR KNIGHTLY:
Harriet Smith has some first-rate qualities which Mrs. Elton is totally without.
---
## EMMA:
How wonderful that you and I should agree on something at last! 
---
## EMMA:
I believe Harriet's infatuation with Mr. Elton should now be at an end. 
---
## EMMA:
That is good news, at least.
---
## MR WESTON:
Come Miss Woodhouse, you must be dancing!
---
## EMMA:
I am ready whenever I am wanted.
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
Whom are you going to dance with?
---
## EMMA
With you, if you will ask me.
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
Will you?
---
## EMMA
Indeed I will.
---
## EMMA:
You have shown that you can dance, 
---
## EMMA:
and though your brother is married to my
sister,
---
## EMMA:
well, we are not really so much brother and sister 
---
## EMMA:
as to make it at all improper.
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
Brother and sister! No, indeed.

---
## EMMA:
The Ball foretells a happy future: 
---
## EMMA:
Harriet, cured of her love for Mr. Elton, 
---
## EMMA:
Mr. Frank Churchill not too much in love with me, 
---
## EMMA:
and Mr. Knightley and I no longer quarreling: 
---
## EMMA:
how very happy a summer must be before me!
---
## EMMA:
Harriet, what has happened?
---
## FRANK:
Sit down here, Miss Smith.
## HARRIET:
Oh, Miss Woodhouse, 
---
## HARRIET:
I was walking with Miss Bickerton on a wooded path. 
---
## HARRIET:
A child came towards us to beg for coins. 
---
## HARRIET:
And Miss Bickerton gave a great scream and ran and cleared a slight hedge. 
---
## HARRIET:
I tried to follow but, as I have a cramp after the dancing last night, 
---
## HARRIET:
I got stuck on the hedge. 
---
## HARRIET:
I was soon assailed by half a dozen children, 
---
## HARRIET:
and I gave them a shilling but they asked for more—
---
## EMMA:
Oh, Harriet!
---
## FRANK:
I was on my way back to my aunt in Richmond 
---
## FRANK:
(I just had to return a pair of scissors to Miss Bates), 
---
## FRANK:
and I rescued Miss Smith from the little ruffians. 
---
## FRANK:
And the hedge. 
---
## FRANK:
She had just strength enough to reach Hartfield. 
---
## FRANK:
Are you quite recovered Miss Smith?
---
## HARRIET:
Yes, thank you. 
---
## HARRIET:
I can not thank you enough.
---
## FRANK:
In that case, I dare not stay longer, 
---
## FRANK:
my aunt expects me. Good day.
---
## HARRIET:
So gallant!
---
## EMMA:
Harriet, dear, rest as long as you like.
---
## HARRIET:
Thank you, Miss Woodhouse.
---
## EMMA:
I hope Papa does not hear of this. 
---
## EMMA:
It would cause him great anxiety. 
---
## EMMA:
But I am sure that concealment will be impossible.
---
## MR WOODHOUSE:
Emma! 
---
## MR WOODHOUSE:
You and Miss Smith must promise never to go beyond the shrubbery again.
---
## MRS ELTON:
We should inform the authorities.
---
## MISS BATES:
Such an adventure. 
---
## MISS BATES:
A fine young man and a lovely young woman 
---
## MISS BATES:
thrown together in such a way.
---
## MISS BATES:
By pirates! Pirates, mother.
---
## EMMA:
A very extraordinary thing. 
---
## EMMA:
This occurrence must strongly recommend Mr. Frank Churchill to Harriet. 
---
## EMMA:
But I shall not drop a hint. 
---
## EMMA:
I have had enough of meddling.
---
## HARRIET:
Miss Woodhouse, 
---
## HARRIET:
I know not how I could have fancied myself in love 
---
## HARRIET:
with Mr. Elton for so long. 
---
## HARRIET:
I can see nothing at all extraordinary in him now. 
---
## HARRIET:
He was ever so cruel to me at the Ball.
---
## EMMA:
Well, Harriet, whenever you do marry–
---
## HARRIET:
I shall never marry.
---
## EMMA:
Never marry! Harriet --- 
---
## EMMA:
might this result from an idea 
---
## EMMA:
that the person whom you prefer 
---
## EMMA:
would be too greatly your superior in situation?
---
## HARRIET:
Oh! Miss Woodhouse, I have not the presumption to suppose—
---
## HARRIET:
But it is a pleasure for me to admire him at a distance—
---
## HARRIET:
and to think of his infinite superiority to all the rest of the world.
---
## EMMA:
I am not at all surprised, Harriet. 
---
## EMMA:
The service he rendered you was enough to warm your heart.
---
## HARRIET:
Oh! The very recollection of it— 
---
## HARRIET:
when I saw him approaching. 
---
## HARRIET:
In one moment such a change!
---
## HARRIET:
From perfect misery to perfect happiness!
---
## EMMA:
Perhaps it will be wisest not to let your feelings carry you far. 
---
## EMMA:
Let his behavior be the guide. 
---
## EMMA:
I give you this caution now, 
---
## EMMA:
because I am determined against all interference. 
---
## EMMA:
He is your superior, no doubt. 
---
## EMMA:
But Harriet, more wonderful things have taken place.
---
## MRS ELTON:
Such weather for exploring. 
---
## MRS ELTON:
I propose a trip to Box Hill. 
---
## MRS ELTON:
It is purported to have a beautiful view.
---
## MRS ELTON:
And as a married woman, I shall be Chaperone!
---
## EMMA:
Mrs. Elton as chaperone. Hm.
---
## FRANK:
Regardless of who serves as chaperone, 
---
## FRANK:
you, Miss Woodhouse, 
---
## FRANK:
shall be my first object.
---
## EMMA:
If you insist, Mr. Frank Churchill.
---
## MRS ELTON:
My dear Jane, 
---
## MRS ELTON:
I have found you a most desirable situation as governess.
---
## JANE FAIRFAX:
I thank you, Mrs. Elton. 
---
## JANE FAIRFAX:
But I will not engage in anything at present.
---
## FRANK:
she made quite a blunder!
---
## EMMA:
I could die of laughter!
---
## MR WESTON:
Lovely day for picnic, is it not, Miss Bates?
---
## MISS BATES:
Oh, yes, Mr. Weston! 
---
## MISS BATES:
With strawberries!
---
## MISS BATES:
the best fruit in England!
---
## EMMA:
a little upstart, so vain.
---
## FRANK:
Indeed, Miss Woodhouse.
---
## HARRIET:
Oh, I had not the slightest idea, Mr. Knightley.
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
Oh yes, Miss Smith, the crops must be rotated.
---
## FRANK:
I am obliged to you, Miss Woodhouse, 
---
## FRANK:
for insisting, nay, commanding that I come today.
---
## EMMA:
You really are unanswerable.
--- 
## MISS BATES:
Such weather, Mr. Knightley! 
---
## MISS BATES:
No rain at all. 
---
## MISS BATES:
Though I do not care for myself. 
---
## MISS BATES:
Quite thick shoes.
---
## FRANK:
Ladies and gentlemen, 
---
## FRANK:
I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse—
---
## EMMA:
That is nonsense!
---
## FRANK:
I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse 
---
## FRANK:
to say that she desires to know what you are all thinking of.
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
Is Miss Woodhouse sure that she would like 
---
## MR KNIGHTLY:
to hear what we are all thinking of?
---
## EMMA:
Oh! no, no. 
---
## EMMA:
Let me hear anything rather than what you are all thinking of.
---
## MRS ELTON:
This is not at all the thing, Mr. E.
---
## MR ELTON:
Exactly so, my dear.
---
## FRANK:
Ladies and gentlemen—
---
## FRANK:
I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse to say ... 
---
## FRANK:
that she requires from each of you 
---
## FRANK:
either one thing very clever, 
---
## FRANK:
two things moderately clever, 
---
## FRANK:
or three things very dull indeed.
---
## MISS BATES:
Oh! very well, then I need not be uneasy. 
---
## MISS BATES:
Three things very dull indeed. That will do for me,
---
## MISS BATES:
you know. I shall be sure to say three dull things 
---
## MISS BATES:
as soon as ever I open my mouth, shan't I?
---
## EMMA:
Ah! Miss Bates, 
---
## EMMA:
there may be a difficulty. 
---
## EMMA:
You will be limited as to number—only three.
---
## MISS BATES:
Ah!—well—to be sure. 
---
## MISS BATES:
Yes, I see what she means, 
---
## MISS BATES:
and I will try to hold my tongue. 
---
## MISS BATES:
I must make myself very disagreeable, 
---
## MISS BATES:
or she would not have said such a thing 
---
## MISS BATES:
to an old friend.
---
## JANE FAIRFAX:
Dear Aunt, shall we walk and admire the view?
---
## MISS BATES:
If you please, Jane. 
---
## MISS BATES:
Very dull, to be sure ... 
---
## MISS BATES:
I shall hold my tongue.
---
## MRS ELTON:
These kind of games are very well at Christmas, 
---
## MRS ELTON:
but quite out of place in summer.
---
## MR ELTON:
Exactly so. Shall we walk, Augusta? 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
Emma, I must speak to you. 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
How could you be so unfeeling to Miss Bates? 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
So insolent in your wit 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
to a woman of her age and situation? 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
Emma, I had not thought it possible.
---
## EMMA:
It was not so very bad. 
---
## EMMA:
I dare say she did not understand me.
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
I assure you she did. 
---
## MR KNIGHTLY:
She felt your full meaning.
---
## EMMA:
I know there is not a better creature in the world: 
---
## EMMA:
but you must allow that she can be ridiculous.
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
I acknowledge that; 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
and were she a woman of fortune, 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
I would not quarrel with you. 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
Were she your equal in situation— but, Emma, 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
consider: She is poor; 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
she has sunk from the comforts she was born to; 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
and, if she live to old age, 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
must probably sink more. 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
Her situation should secure your compassion. 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
It was badly done, indeed! 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
You, whom she had seen grow up 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
from a period when her notice of you was an honor, 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
to have you now, laugh at her, 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
humble her——and before others, 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
many of whom would be entirely 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
guided by your treatment of her.
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
This is not pleasant for you, Emma—
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
and it is far from pleasant to me; 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
but I must – I will tell you truths while I can; 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel, 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
and trusting that you will soon do me greater justice than you can do now.
---
## EMMA:
I am mortified beyond expression. 
---
## EMMA:
There is no denying the truth of what Mr. Knightley said. 
---
## EMMA:
How could I have been so brutal, so cruel to Miss Bates? 
---
## EMMA:
I deserve his ill opinion. 
---
## EMMA:
Miss Bates ... 
---
## EMMA:
well, if good conduct in future can do away with the ungracious past, 
---
## EMMA:
I might hope to be forgiven.
---
## EMMA:
Ah, Miss Fairfax. I had hoped to speak to Miss Bates.
---
## JANE FAIRFAX:
I am afraid my aunt is not well. 
---
## JANE FAIRFAX:
She will not see – 
---
## JANE FAIRFAX:
she is quite unable to have visitors.
---
## EMMA:
I am truly sorry.
---
## JANE FAIRFAX:
Indeed, Miss Woodhouse.
---
## EMMA:
Please extend my good wishes to Miss Bates. 
---
## EMMA:
Mr. Knightley!
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
I would not go away without seeing you. 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
I am going to London, to visit my brother and Isabella.
---
## EMMA:
Is not this a sudden scheme?
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
Yes—rather—I have been thinking of it some little time.
---
## EMMA:
I had hoped we would have a moment to speak together.
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
Perhaps when I return. I am sorry, Emma. 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
I must be going. 
---
## EMMA:
Mr. Knightley seems anxious to be without my company as well. 
---
## EMMA:
I must talk with Mrs. Weston.
---
## MRS WESTON:
Emma, dear. We've had most unexpected news: 
---
## MRS WESTON:
Mrs. Churchill has died –
---
## EMMA
Frank's aunt has died?
---
## MR WESTON:
It is true, my dear. 
---
## MR WESTON:
The great Mrs. Churchill is no more. 
---
## MR WESTON:
Frank is therefore free to choose his own future.
---
## MR WESTON:
In consequence of that, there is something else, Emma. 
---
## MRS WESTON:
Frank has been here this very morning, on a most surprising errand. 
---
## MR WESTON:
He came to speak to his father on a subject ... 
---
## MR WESTON:
Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax are engaged; 
---
## MR WESTON:
nay, have been long engaged!
---
## EMMA:
Jane Fairfax and Frank Churchill! 
---
## EMMA:
Good God!
---
## MRS WESTON:
You may well be amazed. 
---
## MRS WESTON:
There has been a solemn engagement between them 
---
## MRS WESTON:
ever since October—formed at Weymouth, 
---
## MRS WESTON:
and kept a secret from everybody.
---
## EMMA:
Poor Harriet!
---
## EMMA:
Engaged all the winter— 
---
## EMMA:
before either of them came to Highbury?
---
## MRS WESTON:
It has hurt his father and me, Emma, very much. 
---
## MRS WESTON:
Some part of his conduct we can not excuse.
---
## EMMA:
I will not pretend not to understand you. 
---
## EMMA:
There was a period in the early part of our acquaintance,
---
## EMMA:
when I was very much disposed to be attached to him. 
---
## EMMA:
Fortunately, it did cease.
---
## MR WESTON:
I am so relieved. On this point we have been wretched.
---
## EMMA:
I have escaped. 
---
## EMMA:
But this does not acquit Mr. Frank Churchill. 
---
## EMMA:
His behavior was beyond impropriety!
---
## MRS WESTON:
I gather, Emma, that he thought you had guessed the secret.
---
## EMMA:
I? Guessed? Well—! 
---
## EMMA:
Mr. Weston, I congratulate you, with all my heart, 
---
## EMMA:
on the prospect of having one of the most lovely and 
---
## EMMA:
accomplished young women in England for your daughter.
---
## MR WESTON:
Thank you, dear Miss Woodhouse.
---
## EMMA:
Poor Harriet! 
---
## EMMA:
Mr. Knightley spoke truth when he once said, 
---
## EMMA:
"Emma, you have been no friend to
Harriet Smith."
---
## HARRIET:
Miss Woodhouse! 
---
## HARRIET:
Is not this the oddest news? Jane Fairfax and Mr. Frank Churchill are to be married. 
---
## HARRIET:
Had you any idea of his being in love with her?
---
## EMMA:
I never had the slightest suspicion of his having the least regard for Jane Fairfax. 
---
## EMMA:
If I had, I should have cautioned you accordingly.
---
## HARRIET:
Me! Why should you caution me? 
---
## HARRIET:
You do not think I care about Mr. Frank Churchill.
---
## EMMA:
I am delighted to hear you speak so. 
---
## EMMA:
But did you never care about him?
---
## HARRIET:
Him! Never. 
---
## HARRIET:
I know we agreed never to name him— 
---
## HARRIET:
but considering how infinitely superior he is to everybody else, 
---
## HARRIET:
I hope I have better taste than to think of Mr. Frank Churchill.
---
## EMMA
Harriet! Let us understand each other now, 
---
## EMMA
without the possibility of farther mistake. 
---
## EMMA
Are you speaking of—Mr. Knightley?
---
## HARRIET:
To be sure. When we talked about him, 
---
## HARRIET:
it was as clear as possible.
---
## EMMA:
Not quite. 
---
## EMMA:
I could almost assert that you had named Mr. Frank Churchill. 
---
## EMMA:
I told you that I did not wonder at your attachment, 
---
## EMMA:
considering the service he had rendered you 
---
## EMMA:
in coming to your rescue from the young vagrants.
---
## HARRIET:
But I was thinking of Mr. Knightley's asking me to dance when Mr. Elton would not stand up with me. 
---
## HARRIET:
That was the service which made me begin to feel how superior he was to every other being upon earth.
---
## EMMA:
Good God! What is to be done?
---
## HARRIET:
You would not have encouraged me, then, 
---
## HARRIET:
if you had understood me? 
---
## HARRIET:
You must think him five hundred million times more above me.
---
## EMMA:
Have you any idea of Mr. Knightley's returning your affection?
---
## HARRIET:
Yes, I must say that I have. 
---
## HARRIET:
He has often talked ever so delightfully with me. 
---
## HARRIET:
I never should have presumed to think of it but for your encouragement.

## HARRIET:
You told me to observe him carefully, 
---
## HARRIET:
and let his behavior be the rule of mine—and so I have.
---
## EMMA:
Harriet ... I will venture to declare that Mr. Knightley is the last man in the world 
---
## EMMA:
who would intentionally give any woman the idea of his feeling for her more than he really does.
---
## HARRIET:
Thank you, Miss Woodhouse!
---
## EMMA:
Oh, God, that I had never seen her! 
---
## EMMA:
Mr. Knightley ... to marry Harriet? 
---
## EMMA:
Mr. Knightley to be no longer coming to Hartfield? 
---
## EMMA:
No longer walking in at all hours 
---
## EMMA:
as if ever willing to change his own home for ours? 
---
## EMMA:
How can I endure it?
---
## EMMA:
Mr. Knightley ... must not marry Harriet ... 
---
## EMMA:
Mr. Knightley must ... marry ... 
---
## EMMA:
me! 
---
## EMMA:
Oh, the blindness of my own heart! 
---
## EMMA:
How long has Mr. Knightley been so dear to me? 
---
## EMMA:
I suppose there never has been a time 
---
## EMMA:
when I did not consider Mr. Knightley as infinitely superior to any man. 
---
## EMMA:
I believe I have never not loved him.
---
## EMMA:
Oh, the blunders! 
---
## EMMA:
I proposed to arrange everybody's destiny and was proved to be universally mistaken! 
---
## EMMA:
Harriet and Mr. Elton, Harriet and Frank Churchill, Frank Churchill and me! 
---
## EMMA:
Good God even Jane Fairfax and an unnamed married Irishman. 
---
## EMMA:
And now – Harriet and Mr. Knightley? 
---
## EMMA:
Such arrogance.
---
## EMMA:
Does Mr. Knightley truly love Harriet? 
---
## EMMA:
Would I be willing to sacrifice my love for Harriet's feelings? 
---
## EMMA:
I am not sure that I am able.... I should do ... but I do not know that I can.
---
## EMMA:
Well, one thing I can do... that must be done.
---
## EMMA:
I do hope you are feeling better, Miss Bates.
---
## MISS BATES:
Indeed, Miss Woodhouse, thank you for asking.
---
## EMMA:
I have come to wish Miss Fairfax joy on her engagement.
---
## MISS BATES:
Oh!
---
## EMMA:
And to visit you, Miss Bates.
---
## MISS BATES:
So very kind of you! But you are always so kind.
---
## EMMA:
Perhaps not always, Miss Bates.
## MISS BATES:
No matter. 
---
## MISS BATES:
Old friends, Miss Woodhouse, are the best kind of friends. I will go call Jane.
---
## EMMA:
Miss Bates is the height of generosity. 
---
## EMMA:
Would that I could say the same of myself. 
---
## EMMA:
But I believe, that if Mr. Knightley could see into my heart, 
---
## EMMA:
he would not, on this occasion, 
---
## EMMA:
find anything to reprove. 
---
## EMMA:
But what of Harriet and Mr. Knightley? Do you think he truly loves her?
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
Emma. I have heard the news – 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
Miss Fairfax and Frank Churchill ... their engagement.
---
## EMMA:
You probably have been less surprised than any of us. 
---
## EMMA:
I seem to have been doomed to blindness.
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
Time, my dearest Emma, time will heal the wound. 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
He is an abominable scoundrel!
---
## EMMA:
You are very kind—but you are mistaken. 
---
## EMMA:
I have behaved in a way that I must always be ashamed of, 
---
## EMMA:
but I have no other reason for regret.
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
Emma –
---
## EMMA:
I have very little to say for my own conduct.
---
## EMMA:
My vanity was flattered, and I allowed his
attentions. 
---
## EMMA:
But I have never been attached to him.
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
Everything turns out for his good. 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
He has used everybody ill, and they are all delighted to forgive him. 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
He is a fortunate man indeed!
---
## EMMA:
You speak as if you envied him.
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
I do envy him, Emma. 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
You will not ask me what is the point of envy. 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
You are wise—but I can not be wise. 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
Emma, I must tell you what you will not ask, 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
though I may wish it unsaid the next moment.
---
## EMMA:
Then don't speak it. Take a little time, consider, do not commit yourself.
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
Indeed. Thank you. Good day. 
---
## EMMA:
Mr. Knightley, I stopped you ungraciously just now, 
---
## EMMA:
and, I am afraid, gave you pain. 
---
## EMMA:
But if you have any wish to speak openly to me as a friend, 
---
## EMMA:
I will hear whatever you like.
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
As a friend! Emma, 'friend' I fear is a word—. 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
Tell me, then, have I no chance of ever succeeding?
---
## EMMA:
Succeeding?
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
My dearest Emma, for dearest you will always be, 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
my dearest, most beloved Emma—tell me at once. 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
Say 'No' if it is to be said. I can not make speeches, Emma. 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more ... 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
you are as important to me in all your ways as ... 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
we are so often together, talking confidentially ...
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
You know what I am. I can never hold my tongue: 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
I have vexed you, and lectured you, 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
and you have borne it as no one in England would have borne it, 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
and still you remain my friend. 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
But I think you understand ... 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
the depths of my feelings?
---
## EMMA:
Yes. I think I do.
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
Yes? (I am half agony, half hope.) 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
Can you return them?
---
## EMMA:
I can. I will. I do.
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
My own Emma.
---
## EMMA:
My own Mr. Knightley.
---
---
## EMMA:
My father! 
---
## EMMA:
I could never leave my father, 
---
## EMMA:
I could never leave Hartfield. 
---
## EMMA:
It is a sin to even think of it.
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
Oh, Emma, you are quite right. 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
I had not considered.... 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
Well, so long as your father's happiness requires you to live at Hartfield, 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
it shall be my home as well.
---
## EMMA
Oh, Mr. Knightley!
---
## EMMA:
What of Harriet? 
---
## EMMA:
She is in love with Mr. Knightley ... 
---
## EMMA:
and I must destroy her hopes....
---
## HARRIET:
Miss Woodhouse –
---
## EMMA:
Harriet - 
---
## EMMA & ## HARRIET:
I have news.
---
## EMMA & ## HARRIET:
Oh!
---
## EMMA:
Harriet, allow me to speak first. 
---
## EMMA:
Much to my own astonishment, I find that I myself am in love
---
## EMMA:
with Mr. Knightley. He has proposed to me and I have accepted.
---
## HARRIET:
Mr. Knightley?
---
## EMMA:
Yes, Harriet. I know I have behaved abominably –
---
## HARRIET:
Oh, Miss Woodhouse.... 
---
## HARRIET:
I can not be too angry with you, however. 
---
## HARRIET:
As it happens, my heart is overflowing with happiness – 
---
## HARRIET:
Robert Martin has proposed to me again.
---
## EMMA:
Robert Martin? Good God!
---
## HARRIET:
The fact is, I have always liked Robert Martin very much. And his continuing to love me, 
---
## HARRIET:
in spite of my rejection of him, proved irresistible.
---
## EMMA
Harriet, I am so pleased!
---
## HARRIET:
And I wish you joy, Miss Woodhouse!
---
## HARRIET:
I realize you will not be able to continue a friendship with me ... 
---
## HARRIET:
the wife of a farmer....
---
## EMMA:
Nonsense. It will be a great pleasure to know Mr. and Mrs. Robert Martin.... 
---
## EMMA:
I shall visit you often at Abbey-Mill Farm. 
---
## EMMA:
You have two parlors, I hear.
---
## HARRIET:
And eight cows, Miss Woodhouse!
---
## MR WOODHOUSE:
Emma, such alarming news! 
---
## MR WOODHOUSE:
Our henhouse has been robbed. 
---
## MR WOODHOUSE:
Chicken thieves! Brigands! 
---
## MR WOODHOUSE:
My dear Emma, perhaps it might be best 
---
## MR WOODHOUSE:
if the wedding took place as soon as possible, 
---
## MR WOODHOUSE:
that we might be under Mr. Knightley's protection.
---
## MISS BATES:
Oh, dear me, never were there so many weddings! 
---
## MISS BATES:
Weddings, mother! 
---
## MISS BATES:
Jane and Mr. Frank Churchill, 
---
## MISS BATES:
Miss Smith and Mr. Robert Martin, 
---
## MISS BATES:
and Miss Woodhouse and Mr. Knightley! 
---
## MISS BATES:
So much cake, mother....
---
## MRS ELTON:
But very little white satin....
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
You have always called me, "Mr. Knightley." 
---
## MR KNIGHTLEY:
Can you not call me "George," now that we are married?
---
## EMMA:
George? 
---
## EMMA:
Impossible! 
---
## EMMA:
I can never call you anything but Mr. Knightley. 
---
## EMMA:
But remember this: 
---
## EMMA:
I called you once by your Christian name: 
---
## EMMA:
when Emma took George, for better, for worse.
