### MARC:
Hello?

### FRANZ:
Marc? 

---

It’s me, Franz. I just wanted to go back to something we talked about this morning

---

would you agree that the iconography of your paintings resonates more as a complex chord, 

---

in which the immediately evident is instantaneously harmonized into a host of sublimated visions, as Breton put it in 41, 

---

that you give "metaphor...plastic support in hypnagogic and eidetic imagery"?

---

Marc? …Marc? What do you think?

---

### MARC:
Sorry… Was that a question?

---

### FRANZ:
Yes. Do you agree?

---

### MARC:
Yes…

---

### FRANZ:
Are you sure?

### MARC:
Yes. Hypna… Yes.

---

### FRANZ:
Alright. Now, an image - a recurring image - in your work is, of course, 

---

that of aerial lovers whose joy manifests itself in an al- most palpable… frisson of colors and planes on the canvas.

---

And yet, in their ecstasy, their attitude is somehow not exclusive. 

---

Their image becomes a kind of banner of spiritual potentiality under which everyone can march, even the sick at heart…

---

### MARC:
Franz, Franz… “Banners”? “Marching”…?
Franz, do you know why people paint?

---

### FRANZ:
Well… lots of reasons I suppose…

---

### FRANZ:
Marc…? Marc….?

---

### MARC:
That’s Vitebsk, my hometown, in 1914.

---

Two cathedrals, it had! And sixty synagogues…

---

You know, they flattened it in the war, the Nazis - they pounded it to dust. 

---

And for those that never knew it, this is all that remains - black and white postcards…

---

### FRANZ:
Marc, are you alright?

---

### MARC:
When some things are gone, Franz, you thirst for their details in such a heart-breaking way… 

---

you feel an agony of need to remember… Perhaps the smell of a room in a house that has been razed to the ground for twenty years…

---

Shall I tell you a secret? In 1914, Vitebsk wasn’t black and white at all!

---

The light was actually green in my eyes! And Gold! And some- times faintly lilac!

---

The air… smelt of dung! Because we all kept cows in our back yards!

---

What else? I can smell… cinnamon in something baking…

---

And smoke from the lamp - that wick needs a trim…

---

[oil sizzling]
And Mamma is frying fishballs…

---

[the whistle of a kettle]
My God, you know what that is don‘t you?! The samovar just starting to bubble!

---

[clock ticking]
That’s our old clock, spending time like it had no end of it…

---

### BELLA:
[singing a haunting, Klezmer-inspired melody]
LY, LY, LY,LY, LY, LY, LY, LY LY LY

---

### MARC:
That… that’s Bella!

---

### BELLA & MARC:
[Singing together]
LY, LY, LY,LY, LY, LY, LY, LY LY LY 

---

### MARC:
Extraordinary! How like a girl she sounds! I suppose she almost was in 1914… 

---

You know, when she left school she was one of the four brightest students in all Russia!

---

And for some reason, she took an interest in me…

---

### BELLA:
Let me tell you about the first time I saw him. 

---

I’d gone to visit my friend, Thea, who’s the daughter of our doctor. 

---

I waited two minutes on the doorstep before she answered the door to me.

---

Then, for some reason, her face was red and shiny as a freshly washed radish! 

---

I barged in and plopped down onto a leather-bound sofa in her father’s waiting room 

---

and began chattering on about some nonsense or other. 

---

But she was behaving very oddly… She shifted from foot to foot as if she needed to pay a visit 

---

and she seemed constantly on the verge of tittering in a high voice and floating up into the chandelier.

---

And every few moments she stole a glance at the door of her father's surgery. 

---

So, Thea Brachman, who are you hiding away from me in there?

---

### MARC:
[Singing]
BUM, BUM, BUM, BUM, BUM, BUM. BUM, BUM, BUM, BUM, BUM, BUM, BUM, BUM, BUM, BUM

---

### BELLA:
My toes were as roots into the floor. 

---

Sheets of bluish flame rippled silently along the walls and ceiling and leapt into my hair.

---

His eyes. So blue. Splinters of heaven! They shot into me like arrows into a tree and made all my leaves quiver. 

---

Now I remembered Thea had already talked about him. He’s a painter, a Jewish painter. 

---

He must encounter such misunderstanding here in sleepy Vitebsk. We must befriend him, she said. 

---

He needed models with open minds. Nude models...

---

[A playful, youthful tune begins]

---

I was already running away, only I hadn't moved yet. 

---

"Thea, I must go home..."

---

### MARC:
Why?

### BELLA:
he said,

---

### MARC:
You have such a beautiful smile, I want to draw you.

---

### BELLA:
Draw me? He was killing me! He’d climbed inside me and was running along beside me. 

---

My face was now all shiny radishes like Thea's. 

---

I looked down at the floor and saw my feet stepping onto the cobbles outside.

---

[Musicians playing a playful, energetic melody]

---

### MUSICIANS:
[singing]
LY, LY, LY, LY, LY…

---

### BELLA:
It seems as if we were courting the very next day. I remember sitting on a fallen tree by the river with him.

---

We were too frightened to kiss, and yet I possessed with a passion the heat of half your body,

---

From your left shoulder to your left ankle…

---



---

But then he went to Paris. To find greatness. Four years he’s been gone and he writes hardly at all. 

---

Have you met greatness in the boulevards yet? Does she wear silk stockings…?

---

### BELLA:
[Singing intensely in Russian]
Vsyo n’e spitza, n’e siditza N’et pakoya na dushe

---

### ALL:
[Singing]
Vsyo n’e spitza, n’e siditza N’et pakoya na dushe

---

Vdal' menya kuda-to t'yanet Pa shirokomu shasse

---

Vdal' menya kuda-to t'yanet Pa shirokomu shasse

---

[Train Whistle]

---

### MARC:
Danke Herwarth. And Danke the others at 'Der Sturm' for me - and DANKE BERLIN! 

---

It was the best exhibition I‘ve ever had! Now I can go back to Russia at last with my head held high!

---

Oh… Walden! 

---

### MUSICIANS:
[Singing and playing underneath the dialogue]
LA, LA, LA, LA, LA……


---


### MARC:
I'm only going to be in Russia for three months

---

I have my sister's wedding to go to next week, and my own the week after…! If she’ll still have me…

---

Herwarth! I've wrapped one canvas and put it behind your desk. It's called 'Dedicated to my Fiancée’. 

---

On your life, don't sell that one - it‘s for her, my fiancé. Bella. Bella Rosenfeld.

---

You can show it to people, just don't sell it. We'll pick it up on our way back to Paris. 

---

See you in three months! Auf wiedersehen!

---

### MUSICIANS:
[Singing]
LA, LA, LA, LA, LA, LA, LA… 

---

[Music becomes melacholy]
### BELLA:
Mother, why are you crying? 

---

Oh. Tishah b’Av again. I always forget. Must we actually weep every year? The Temple of Jerusalem fell so long ago - 

---

they’d be astonished to think we're still weeping now. 

---

Yes, I'm sure I'll understand one day, but it's summer outside, remember? 

---

It's time to pick blackberries… A new reason to weep? Mother you musn't find new reasons, you have enough old ones. 

---

Listen, if war can be declared so easily it must be a game. They'll call it off as quick again to- morrow.

---

[Twinkling, descending piano music]

---

Marc…! from Berlin?

---

He's coming home! He wants to marry me!

---

[Music becomes fun and jaunty]

---

### BELLA:
Our wedding was within the month, at the house of my parents.

---

### MARC:
Oh my God. Am I late? Look - the whole Sanhedrin is here.

---

And I have as little to say as a corpse at his funeral, let alone the groom at his wedding, 

---

so I hope they don't expect any speeches…

---

### BELLA:
People come offering their doubts like gifts, smiling slyly,

---

### BELLA:
"A painter is he? Could he come and paint our dining room before Passover?" 

---

And I receive their doubts smiling equally slyly and stoke them onto a bonfire in my heart.

---

### MARC:
And look at all this! Stuffed trout, calves foot jelly, fried udders...

---

There's half an ark-full on these tables. Do you know they eat grapes in this house like my father eats onions …

---

### MARC & BELLA:
[Singing together]
LY LY LY LY LY LY…

---

[Music stops]
### MARC:
Bella. My dear Bella. 

---

It's a pity I'm no Veronese, what a sight you are! Can you hear my eyes?

---

### BELLA:
Yes! Can you hear mine?

---

### MARC:
Yes. God help me, I feel like a clown!

---

### BELLA:
You look like one! 

---

You’re beautiful. I want to waste the rest of my life with you!

---

### MARC:
Look at them... If only they knew. This isn’t the crisp white start they think it is. 

---

My knowing you has already seeped backwards as well as forwards in time 

---

so my whole life is pervaded with the color of loving you.

---

### BELLA:
Do you remember when I came to you that day…?

---

### MARC:
I lifted you in over the window sill.

---

### BELLA:
I could hear the neighbors clucking their tongues.

---

### MARC:
You’d brought a great bunch of flowers.

---

### BELLA:
I’d got up early and scrambled round the edge of town like a mad woman…

---

### MARC:
Your hair was all tangled with burrs!

---

### BELLA:
I’d picked ‘til my hands were stinging…

---

### MARC:
You smelt of earth!

---

### BELLA:
…blues and golds and pinks, then I wrapped them in all my shawls of color…

---

### MARC:
And you’d robbed your own house of a cake and some of your mother’s fried fish…

---

### BELLA:
Then I ran in the heat, along by the river.

---

### MARC:
I hadn’t the faintest idea why you’d brought all this.“Have you just come from the station or something?” I said.

---

### BELLA:
“No. What day is it?”

---

### MARC:
“You know how I lose track of the days Bella. Is it Tuesday? Wednesday…?”

---

### BELLA:
“No, you fool! It’s your BIRTHDAY!”

---

[lively, youthful music plays]

---

### BELLA:
You began to paint very fast… You… tugged me piece-by- piece under your brush… up off the ground, 

---

tugged back my head with your lips so that my eyes fell against the cupola of the church through the window 

---

and in my hands the flowers at the edge of my grip but they will never fall… 

---

you latched them there… and now they will always be on the edge of falling…

---

I was as far beyond doubt as the moon…

---

### BELLA:
[Singing a solemn, hymn-like tune in Russian]
Kak po moriu, po volnistornu.

---

### ALL:
[singing]
Po sinemu, po volnistornu, Po sinemu, po volnistonu,

---

### MARC:
[singing]
Pliu yoti lebegs

---

### ALL:
[singing]
Pliu yoti lebegs legbegs dya ta mi Pliu yoti lebegs legbegs dya ta-

---

### BELLA & MUSICIANS:
[vocalizing to a jaunty, Klezmer-inspired melody]
Dy, Dy, Dy, Dy, Dy, Dy, Dy, Dy, Dy, Dy

---

[music continues]

---

### BELLA:
[Singing in Russian]
Kak po moriu, po volnistornu.

---

Po sinemu, po volnistornu, Po sinemu, po volnistornu.

---

---

### MARC:
Wait...Bella... Bella...

---

### BELLA:
As Europe took itself to war, we took ourselves on honey- moon, to my family’s dacha in the woods at Zaolshe.

---

### MARC:
No more. I'm going to explode.

---

### BELLA:
Drink it up. Every last drop. It's only three kopecs a bucket.

---

### MARC:
We'll remember this as our milkmoon.

---

### BELLA:
Milkmoon. Isn't that odd. Did I just say that to you?

---

### MARC:
No, I've just thought of it.

---

### BELLA:
I thought that yesterday, that this was our milkmoon. 

---

I've talked to you so much that I keep tripping over your thoughts in my head.

---

We're like a pair of opera glasses. We choose to see the same things, to like the same things.

---

### MARC:
Like what? Tell me.

---

### BELLA:
Big candles. Like the ones our mothers make to go in the shul on the Day of Atonement 

---

by weeping for the world and sealing their tears in wax on threads.

---

### MARC:
The strange Etrog from the citron tree whose fragrance wafts over your head in the sukkah 

---

at the Feast of Tabernacles and makes your mouth water.

---

### BELLA:
Wall-clocks with brass swords for pendulums that groan just before the hour 

---

then pound a chime that shocks you until you've forgotten again an hour later.

---

### MARC:
Cows,

---

### BELLA:
cockerels,

---

### MARC:
fishes... 

---

When I painted these things in Paris, people looked at them like I’d dreamt them in a fever…

---

### MARC & BELLA:
[singing hopefully]
Dy, Dy, Dy, Dy, Dy, Dy, Dy, Dy, Dy, Dy….

---

### MARC:
Oh Bella, I can’t wait to show you Paris! I learnt everything I know about painting in my first ten minutes in the Louvre! 

---

And my friends will adore you! 

---

In fact, Cendrars will probably try to get you straight into bed with one of his outrageous poems…!

---

### BELLA:
When do we leave!?

---

### MARC:
I'll go straight back to Vitebsk and bribe the governor for our permits to travel at once.

---

### ALL:
[singing hopefully]
Dy, Dy, Dy, Dy, Dy, Dy, Dy, Dy, Dy, Dy

---

### MARC:
He laughed in my face and said Russia is sealed up like a tomb ‘til the war ends.

---

It’s chaos. The Jews on the border have been accused of spying for the Germans. 

---

They had to clear out in twenty-four hours or get shot. They’re all trudging east now. 

---

Vitebsk is full to the brim.
[Dramatic music]

---

### MARC:
I went to my mother’s house for a cup of tea and there was old man sat by the samovar… 

---

“Pardon me, sir, but who are you?” I said.

---

### BELLA & MUSICIANS 
You might have heard of me, my son. I am the Rabbi of Slousk.

---

### MARC:
The Rabbi of Slousk! With great holes in his boots and his coat all spattered with mud. 

---

The smell was unbelievable but he had the face of an angel. I said “Rabbi”,

---

### BELLA & MUSICIANS: 
Yes, my Son…

---

### MARC:
“You just sit there and have a little rest. But you don’t mind if I… If you… I mean, I‘d like to…” 

---

I didn’t know how to ask if I could paint him. I didn’t want him to take offense and leave…

---

[The Rabbi begins to snore.]

---

### MARC:
But I didn’t have to ask in the end. He was sleeping like a child. 

---

[Dramatic Music]

---

Where will he go? He doesn’t belong anywhere anymore.

---

[Descending piano music]

---

### MARC:
I’ve been called up. To fight for a country in which I’m a third-class citizen…!

---

### BELLA:
No. We’ll go to Petersburg. I could get my brother to find you a position at the war office.

---

### MARC:
Jacov hates me.

### BELLA:
No, he doesn't.

---

Not too much. Oh Marc, you can’t go to the front. 

---

You've got blue eyes and pink cheeks - you're the wrong colors to be a soldier. 

---

And you can carry on painting in Petersburg. 

---

We can pack all the things we love in Vitebsk into our minds and take them with us.

---

### BELLA:
So, we moved to a tiny flat up four flights of stairs, in starving Petersburg.

---

### ALL:
[Harmonizing hopefully]
Ah……………

---

### BELLA:
Here we lead a life where Marc goes off to work at half past seven and he doesn’t come home until half past six.

---

Eleven hours I sit and wait for him…

---

### BELLA:
[Dripping water]
The roof leaks in different places every day. I suppose it depends which way the wind is blowing…

---

I listen all day to the drips dripping… and the clock ticking…

---

[Clock Ticking]
Our hearts are rusting in the damp eh, Mr. Clock? Each tick is an uphill struggle for us.

---

This was a wedding present from my mother and father, you know. 

---

Did I tell you they have three jewelry shops in Vitebsk? But my mother spends her whole life behind the counter.

---

My entire childhood I was sat alone upstairs with a book and a pastry and only the clock for company. 

---

Not much changed here then. Except now I have no pastries…

---

[Bell ringing]
But each night Marc comes home and we invent a new color…

---

[dramatic, passionate music]

---

Then eleven hours more to myself. It’s all very well, I start to think.

---

We may choose to see the same things, but he paints them and puts his name at the bottom of the canvas.

---

What should I do?

---

Everything seemed possible when I was studying in Moscow! 

---

I took acting classes with Stanislavsky you know! “Love the art in yourselves,” he said. 

---

Under his eyes the feelings would stream out of us like sticky cobwebs and bind us all together…!

---

But here I have to love the art inside myself alone. Then another night comes…

---

[Dramatic, passionate music]

---

But this morning… I could just… hear a new tick ticking…

---

…tiny but twice as fast, already starting to fill all the gaps inside me.

---

So, I thought, I had better do something for myself before the day ends. 

---

So, I’ve dug out this old notebook and I’ve started writing, painting in Yiddish, 

---

the most colorful you can be in black and white - 

---

not much, but something in my own hand at least, before it’s too late.

---

[melancholy music]
### MARC:
I’ve always hated Petersburg… 

---

Even daylight is in short supply here. It’s so cold. 

---

I must smile at passersby just to feel the warmth of their smiles in return.

---

They must think I’m a lunatic.

---

And every morning I have to feel grateful to Jacov for saving me from the Front. 

---

All day long the clock gnaws me like a bone.

---

### BELLA:
[Singing a Yiddish lullaby]
ALE ALE LYOU LE SHLOUF ZHE HEI MEIN G’DEE LEH


---


### MARC:
Bella suffers it all without a word…

---

### BELLA 
[singing]
MACH ZAY TSEE E DAI-NEH AIGE LACH DE FAINEH SHTAY

---


### MARC
But then she did study philosophy at university, I suppose.

---

### BELLA 
[singing]
SHTAY HOIP VEE DEH MIT GE ZINGT VEE DA

---


### MARC
And history. And literature. Her thesis was on Dostoyevsky…

---

### BELLA 
[singing]
MEIN LIEB LIEB SEES-KIND GER-LIN GERSHUINT

---


### MARC
I’m painting, in secret at Goldberg’s place,

---

a series of kisses for her. 

---

Does she actually know? Everything I’ve ever made is for her...

---

Now Jacov comes.

---

### JACOV: 
Tell me please, what does the number of conscripts from Dvinsk now stand at? Well?

---

### MARC:
I don’t know.

### JACOV: 
Imbecile! 

---

Can’t you even try to deserve your position?”

---

### MARC:
What joy it is to escape at midday! But something is happening out here… 

---

you can start to feel the motions of time through the soles of your feet…

---

The snow is melting and so are the food queues, 

---

they’re flowing down the Nevsky Prospect with banners for peace and bread and freedom…

---

[Sounds of war and screaming]
The Imperial Guard are firing into the crowd… My… my hat…! 

---

And now, apparently, the Volunsky Regiment has revolted! All sixteen thousand!

---

What…? They say… the Tsar has abdicated!

---

[The screaming becomes cheering]
Hooray…! What are we cheering for now? A Provisional Government! Hooray! 

---

[The noise subsides]
Excuse me… I must get back to work… 

---

But back inside, every soul had left his desk.

---

Even Jacov had gone... the turncoat.

---

Freedom! My God… Today, for the first time since Catherine the Great, a poor Jew is free in Petersburg!

---

No more permits for me now!

---

HOOOORRRAAAYYY!

---

There’s a different mood out on Liteynay now… Soldiers are running everywhere with the badges ripped off their coats -

---

wild horses won’t drag them back to the Front… They’ve broken open the prisons…

---

[Glass shatters]
And the shop windows. They’re helping themselves to silver forks… 

---

And why are they hauling a coat up that lamp post?

---

My God… a policeman… strung up by the neck… I must get off the street…

---

Goldberg’s is just round the corner…

---

Good evening friends…

---

### BELLA (as MENACING MAN):
Jew or not?

---

### MARC:
Excuse me…?

---

### BELLA (as MENACING MAN):
JEW OR NOT?

---

### MARC:
Me? A Jew! You… you insult me comrade!

---

### BELLA (as MENACING MAN):
Alright. Get along.

---

[Gunshot]

---

### ALL:
[Singing softly]
Ah…

---

[BELLA softly crying]

---

### BELLA:
[Singing the Yiddish lullaby]

---

---

### MARC:
You look a bit slimmer.

---

### BELLA:
Now, on the fourth day, you come and see your daughter for the first time. 

---

There’s no possible reason I could understand, but I want to hear you try to explain…

---

### MARC:
An exhibition. Nadezhda Dobchina is going to give me an exhibition…!

---

Bella, Nadezhda Dobchina…!

---

### BELLA:
I don‘t give a damn about Nadezhda Dobchina!

---

### MARC:
This could be my chance in my own country at last! I’ve been painting day and night since I heard…

---

### BELLA:
Painting!!

### MARC:
I thought you’d understand…

---

### BELLA:
It hurt so much…

---

### MARC:
Never, for one moment, did I mean to hurt you…

---

### BELLA:
Not my feelings you imbecile! Here…!

---

### BELLA:
I can still hardly walk! And you come twittering to me about Nadezhda Dobchina!

---

### MARC:
I’m sorry my work seems so trivial to you by comparison…

### BELLA:
Marc!

---

### MARC:
But honestly, do you think what I do happens painlessly? If I stopped pushing I’d never paint another picture again. 

---

And what would I mean without my paintings Bella? Nothing,

---

because my father doesn’t own three jewelry shops he carries barrels of herring all day…

---

### BELLA:
I’ve told you a thousand times, that doesn’t matter to me…

---

### MARC:
You’d never have looked at me twice without my paintings!

---

### BELLA:
People, Marc… you, your daughter! That’s what’s matters most to me. Not paintings…!

---

[Twinkling, descending piano music]

---

### MARC:
A message…

---

"Marc Chagall is invited to become Director of Fine Art in the new Commissariat of Culture." 

---

My God… Look! Mayakowsky for poetry, Meyerhold for theatre, Marc Chagall for Fine Art!!!

---

### BELLA:
You can’t do it…

### MARC:
Why not?

---

### BELLA:
You’d stop painting.

---

### MARC:
A moment ago you didn’t care about my painting!

---

My God, Mother Russia is asking a peasant Jew to be a minister… And of painting!

---

### BELLA:
We must go back to Vitebsk…

---

### MARC:
Vitebsk? No. The Revolution wants me. Me, who paints green cows and… flying rabbis! 

---

The New Russia wants to speak to her people with painted speeches!

---

### BELLA:
Your paintings aren’t speeches Marc! Let’s go back. Please?

---

Maybe in Vitebsk they’ll let you start a little art school or something. You have to keep painting. 

---

And I need my family. I need to go home.

---

### MARC:
Go home? Perhaps. Yes!! An arts school in Vitebsk for people like me! 

---

I could teach the droshky drivers to paint portraits of their horses!

---

[Sound of baby crying]

---

### BELLA:
It’s alright my darling… everything is alright…

---

Maybe if she’d been a boy you’d have found time to come.

---

### MARC:
Have you named her without me?

---

### BELLA:
Only what we talked about.

---

### MARC:
Ida?

---

### BELLA:
For your mother.

---

### MARC:
Ida…

---

### MARC:
Bella… let me hold her.

---

She's not a vase - maybe we should uncover her mouth a little.

---

### MARC:
[Singing the Yiddish lullaby]

---

### BELLA & MARC:
[Singing]
ALE ALE LYOU LE SHLOUF ZHE HEI MEIN G’DEE -LEH MACH ZEY TZEE E DAI NEI AGELACH DE FAINEH

---

SHTAY HOIP VEE DEH MIT GE ZINGT VEE DA MEIN LIEB SEES KIND GER-LIN GESHUINGT

---

[Haunting, romantic, and dramatic music]

---

### MARC:
You are the sign-painters and house-painters of Vitebsk.

---

### BELLA:
They’ll already know who they are Marc.

---

### MARC:
I have called you all together to ask you to join my school. Shut down your sign studios, shut down your daub-shops.

---

All the orders can be sent to the school. We will split the work up between us, fathers and sons working shoulder to shoulder.

---

Now, next week is the first anniversary of the October Revolution. We intend to commemorate it in a big way. 

---

We plan to erect 350 red banners, 7 triumphal arches, 

---

and to repaint the shops and trolleys in the main square in red...and purple,  and yellow, and green…

---

Listen… Let me say it plainly. There’s never been a moment like this before. People like us… 

---

history has always sat on our heads like the lid of a tomb. 

---

But look! That stone has broken! And men like us have risen through the cracks overnight, pushed up by talent and vision alone!

---

So let’s use this moment, my friends, let’s make our dear Vitebsk look more splendid that anyone’s ever dared imagine!

---

Above all, let us be proud - because our gifts belong to Russia and, at last, Russia belongs to us…!

---

[Patriotic singing in Russian]

---

### MARC:
Look at it. Karl Marx. There used to be a bench here where I kissed my wife. Passionately. After dark. 

---

Now this. Do you know it’s so ugly it frightens passing horses and children in prams… Now, listen.

---

"Let's not make fools of ourselves... People of Vitebsk, 

---

did you know that 45,000 pairs of underpants could have been made from the banners at Saturday's march." 

---

I suppose the learned Bolshevik would have advised the burghers of Florence to squeeze their fat arses 

---

into underpants tailored from Raphael's Madonnas. 

---

Listen, "Comrade Chagall's multicoloured air-borne farmyard made a mystical bachannal out of the whole proceedings." 

---

The cow is green because I like it that way -he still cheers for the proletariat. 

---

There is no mystery, or do they need me to dig up Mr. Marx to come and explain it to them.

---

That isn't the half of it. I thought my school needed revolutionary painters. “Men from the capital for the province."

---

So, I invited Malevich the Suprematist, Lissitzky, Alexander Romm - to teach in my school. 

---

Me. I was responsible for flinging all these crabs in the same basket. 

---

Then this morning, when I went there, a banner had been draped across the front of my school saying, SUPREMATIST ACADEMY. 

---

Malevich has started a mutiny! They’ve voted to expel me within 24 hours. 

---

All this time I've laid down my own paint-brush to build this school, to be expelled from it like a naughty schoolboy. 

---

I don't want to deny what they see. Why must they deny my eyes?

---

Must we all paint the same way? Has the Revolution only freed us to fight like dogs until there's only one pack left, 

---

composed of the ugliest with the longest teeth?

---

Right. Let them fight. I know what I’m going to do…

### BELLA:
Marc...

---

### MARC:
Malevich has taken over my school.

### BELLA:
Marc

---

### MARC:
Never mind. You will be pleased to hear, I‘m going to spend the afternoon painting…!

---

### BELLA:
Marc - the Cheka have come to my parent’s shop.

---

They're… they’re taking everything … even the silver from the dining room table. 

---

They're levering the safes out of the walls and smashing the clocks…

---

### MARC:
Why now?

---

### BELLA:
I don’t know, there's been an attempt on Lenin's life or something… 

---

but it’s just an excuse - they’re after the money. Thieves come in uniform nowadays.

---

### MARC:
I’m sorry.

---

### BELLA:
Where are you going?

---



### MARC:
I told you - back to work.

---

### BELLA:
But… I need you to help me!

---



### MARC:
How? I'm a painter.

---

### BELLA:
Your name, your position… they must count for something…

---



### MARC:
They've expelled me from the school!

---

### BELLA:
So, what…? You’re going off to paint flowers or something?

---

### MARC:
If I feel like it.

---

### BELLA:
You… child!! Can’t you see? They’re losing everything they’ve worked for in their whole lives!

---

### MARC:
What matters most to me now is to capture something precious and fleeting for eternity. Not silverware.

---

### BELLA:
What matters now is to do the right thing by those you love! 

---

### MARC:
Would Veronese have painted “The Marriage at Cana” if he was worrying about cutlery…?

---

### BELLA:
Shut up about Veronese for once! Please! We need you now. You can paint tomorrow…

---

### MARC:
You see, that is just your mistake.

---

For you there is always something else more important and that is why you will never be a writer!

---

### MARC:
Bella! Bella!

---

---

### MARC:
We couldn’t stay in Vitebsk. 

---

Not long after we left, my father was crushed by the wheels of a truck while still loading barrels of herring after all these years, 

---

but we didn’t go back for the funeral. We never went back and the world we knew disappeared forever.

---

We went to Moscow to live every day on nothing but black bread and kasha made with millet.

---

Then a friend found me a job at last, painting scenery at the New Jewish Theatre. Bella was intoxicated

---

### BELLA:
[dramatically reciting Yiddish poetry]
Keyner veyst es nisht, afile du aleyn –

---

Az vu ikh zol nisht geyn, trog ikh mit zikh dayn blik,

---

---

### MARC:
[singing a haunting ballad]
NO ONE KNOWS IT, NOT EVEN YOU THAT WHEREVER I GO, I CARRY YOUR GLANCE,

---

LIKE AN AMULET ENGRAVED WITH A SPELL, THE SPELL FOR A FATE SO NEAR AND SO FAR,

---

### BELLA:
Where’s our cave-man?

---

### MARC:
I’m glad someone’s cheerful… Where’s Ida?

---

### BELLA:
With Mikhoels. He was giving us lessons in Yiddish acting! But now I think he’s teaching Ida a very rude song…!

---

### MARC:
How risqué… Well… these actor types are so tiringly colorful, aren’t they?

---

### BELLA:
Are we perhaps a little jealous!?

---

### MARC:
Come off it! But don’t you hate the theatre sometimes? With its endless dreary words… and all that pointless moving about…

---

### BELLA:
How else are they supposed to tell the story?!

---

### MARC:
I don’t know, I just wish they’d just stand still sometimes and let the audience look at the scenery.

---

### BELLA:
Well I think they’re wonderful… I wish I could join them!

---

### MARC:
Oh you’re not serious, who’d look after Ida?

---

### BELLA:
Anyway. I’m too old. Solomon says they do two hours physical training every morning.

---

### MARC:
I know. Upstairs. It feels like they’re trooping about on my skull. It’s impossible to paint…

---

### BELLA:
How is it going?

---

### MARC:
[singing a haunting ballad]
NO ONE KNOWS IT, NOT EVEN YOU BUT SINCE THE DAY WHEN I CAME TO THIS TOWN

---

LONGING HAS BEEN ROAMING OVER ALL THE STREETS AND ALL THE TREES ARE GREENER WITH A NEW SECRET

---

### MARC:
Not a doodle.

---

### BELLA:
Marc… What’s done is done. Lay down this great… sack of old troubles you carry round all the time. 

---

In fact, where is it…? Let me take it away now!

---

### MARC:
Don’t… Bella… STOP! I don’t care anymore.

---

My sister has written. She says they’re closing all the synagogues in Vitebsk - 

---

They’ve turned the one where my father used to pray into a shoe factory! 

---

She says it’s a blessing he died when he did because the sight would have killed him… 

---

I can’t stop feeling how easily his poor life was snuffed out.

---

Fifty-seven years and the truck driver didn’t even notice and drove away whistling. 

---

And now we can’t even afford a stone for him. When less that two years ago they were hanging my paintings in the Winter Palace! 

---

But now it seems my work … it actually embarrasses people! What did they call it…? “Powdered rococo”!

---

### BELLA:
Don’t take any notice of that…

### MARC:
Bella… So how can I paint? Nobody wants us here anymore

---

### BELLA:
But Marc we’ve found ourselves in the one place where we are wanted!

---

My God Marc! The actors… It’s astonishing!

---

They’re… they’re swallowing our whole world and locking it in their bones! 

---

When Mikhoels moves on stage you can see it all there in front of you!

---

### BELLA:

Come on. Take part. What better memorial could you make for your father?!

---

### BELLA:

[Twinkling, descending piano music]

---

### MARC:
It’s from Rubiner in Berlin… It seems I’m famous in Germany!

---

My paintings have launched a movement there called… ‘Expressionism'!

---

"Walden's sold all of your paintings at very good prices but don't expect to see any of the money - 

---

he thinks you're probably dead in the war or the revolution, so the glory alone will make a fine memorial." 

---

I don't believe it - That means he's sold your wedding present Bella... Bella…?

---

### MARC:
From that time forward my fame abroad grew and grew, 

---

but I was never embraced in my motherland as I yearned to be. 

---

But still think those paintings in the Jewish Theatre were the best I ever did.

---

We left Russia soon after and, like millions of others, we didn’t stop wandering for the next twenty years. 

---

And with each step further from home, the older we grew.

---

### BELLA:
[chanting solemnly in Russian]
Vsyo n’e spitza, n’e siditza N’et pakoya na dushe

---

### MARC:
When news reached us, how the Nazis were destroying every last atom of Jewish life in the Pale, 

---

Bella started writing in Yiddish again, about home.

---

### BELLA:
“The station had always worried me. The waiting roomwas always full of agitation.

---

It was so crowded I was afraid the whole population of Vitebsk was leaving, bag and baggage. 

---

What would it be like, a city without people? Perhaps the houses too had been packed up and sent off somewhere.

---

Suddenly the station master appeared in the doorway.

---

### BELLA:
“First call!” he shouted and swung the bell.

---

I didn’t know which faces to concentrate on. Suddenly all of these people seemed near and dear to me.

---

And they were going away and leaving me alone. Would they ever come back? What would happen to the town?

---

The engine roared and swallowed up carriage after carriage of passengers. 

---

The train was taking leave of our city in a cloud of smoke. Sparks flew, flames spurted. 

---

The engine wheezed and started to pull the carriages one after another along behind it.

---

The stoker’s naked back gleamed as if he was in hell. The train was on its way, 

---

and I was going back to the town as to a deserted house. Would the trees still be there? 

---

Everything is silent, I thought. Is Vitebsk still there…?”

---

### MARC:
You’re more like a squirrel every day. Why so tidy all of a sudden?

---

### BELLA:
So you’ll know where everything is. 

---

### MARC:
We were staying at a place outside New York called Cranberry Lake. 

---

The birch trees there always reminded us of Zaolshe, where we spent our Milkmoon. 

---

One day, after swimming in the lake, Bella fell ill.

---

---

### MARC:
We should have stayed at the hospital…

---

### BELLA:
But the nuns…

### MARC:
They’re just women in funny clothes.

---

### BELLA:
Their hats scared me…

### MARC:
They were kind.

---

### BELLA:
So why did they ask me, “what religion”?

---

### MARC:
They were just filling in a form…

---

### BELLA:
You know I saw that sign at the hospital in Beaver Lake…

---

### MARC:
That was Beaver Lake…

### BELLA:
“Only white Christians welcome.”

---

### MARC:
But Bella, we have to go back…

### BELLA:
It’s just a sore throat…

---

### MARC:
If only I could make myself understood. I should have learnt English.

---

### BELLA:
Is Ida coming?

### MARC:
As fast as she can…

---

### BELLA:
You liar!

---

### MARC:
What?

---

### BELLA:
You told me I was the first nude you had ever seen. 

---

I only had the courage to take off my dress because Thea Brachman had done it for you the week before.

---

### MARC:
So, it means I know exactly how much more beautiful you are than Thea Brachman…

---

### BELLA:
Is Ida coming?

### MARC:
Yes.

---

### BELLA:
Talk to me.

### MARC:
I am.

---

### BELLA:
Say something nice.

### MARC:
I can’t think of anything nice…

---

### BELLA:
Sit with me then. You’re making me dizzy.

---

### MARC:
Bella you’re burning! We must go back!

---

### BELLA:
But the nuns…

### MARC:
Damn the nuns…! I’m so scared…

---

### BELLA:
Hush… Something nice…

---

### MARC:
“Nice”…!

---

### BELLA:
Something happy… Please.

---

### MARC:
Alright… think, think… the happiest must be surely that day when you came to my room. 

---

You know, when you surprised me…

---

### BELLA:
Yes! I did it so well!

### MARC:
You did. I had no idea.

---

### BELLA:
Tell me.

---

### MARC:
Surely, you’re sick of it…

---

### BELLA:
Of hearing about my brilliance? Never.

---

### MARC:
Well. It was a very hot day. 

---

I had the window open and the shutters half closed and you tapped on them and I lifted you in.

---

You always brought different flowers. This time they were all wild and delicate and smelling of earth…

---

### BELLA:
My notebooks…

---

### MARC:
Yes. And you were all bedecked in your party clothes. You were panting and carrying several brightly wrapped parcels.

---

"Have you come from the station?" I said to you.

---

"No,” you said, “What day is it today?"

---

"I don’t know. Is it Tuesday or Wednesday?" - I never knew what day it was.

---

"No, you fool. It's your Birthday!" you said!

---

[playful, romantic music]

---

That moment on that day… I needed no more perfect moment than that…

---

### MARC:
It was just a streptococcus throat infection. But it was the war, you see - 

---

the doctor had no penicillin to give her. She went into a coma and she died before Ida could even get there…

---

You know, afterwards, when I read her notebooks, I found them so…vivid! 

---

And I was startled somehow that her view was so close and yet so different to my own. But what a fool!

---

Had it never occurred to me that though we saw the same things, she saw them with her own eyes?

---

And my heart broke again because she had died so hidden - 

---

like all those other Yiddish souls, snuffed out before half their light was shed…

---

Of course, Ida translated her work so beautifully into French and I made those drawings to go with it 

---

and now it‘s published, thank God. So, we uncovered her a little to the world… 

---

But to touch her life with my drawings…! 

---

You know, when I drew my arm around her head, I could actually feel the weight of her hair on my wrist… 

---

and the warmth from the back of her head…

---

What greater purpose could my work have than that?

---

Forgive me Franz… What was your question?

---

### FRANZ:
Never mind. We can pick up again tomorrow. 

---

Ida sends a kiss by the way.

### MARC:
Send her one from me then. A nice one!

---

### FRANZ:
Goodnight Marc.

### MARC:
Goodnight Franz.

---

Fishballs. Vava is a better cook than a model – and these are delicious.

---

She’ll never pose for me. She gets “ants in her pants!” Is that what you say?!

---

I suppose “being a good model” isn’t a wedding vow. Perhaps it should be for the wives of painters…

---

[Youthful, joyful music]

---

### BELLA:
Your breath smells of fishballs.

---

### MARC:
Have one. Then you won’t notice.

---

### BELLA:
Not as good as mine…

---

### MARC:
I’m sorry.

---

### BELLA:
Don’t be. They’re only fishballs.

---

### MARC:
I’m not sorry about the fishballs…

---

[Stirring, emotional music that resolves in one final, echoing chord]
