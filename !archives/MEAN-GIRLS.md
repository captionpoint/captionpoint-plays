## DAMIAN:
Good morning! Welcome to High school.


---

## JANIS:
We're here to welcome you, but also to talk to you about something serious.



---

## DAMIAN:
We're gonna tell you the story of our friend Cady. 

---

How she moved here from Kenya and how her dodgy decisions caused another to get hit by a bus. 

---

Actions and Consequences

---

## JANIS:
This painting I made will represent teenage female power.


---

## DAMIAN:
And this picture of George Michael...is something I like to hold when I'm singing.



---

## JANIS:
IT'S A CAUTIONARY TALE OF FEAR AND LUST AND PRIDE


---


BASED ON ACTUAL EVENTS WHERE PEOPLE DIED


---

## DAMIAN:

BUT HOW FAR WOULD YOU GO

TO BE POPULAR AND HOT?


---


WOULD YOU RESIST TEMPTATION?


---

## JANIS:
NO, YOU WOULD NOT!

JUST ADMIT IT, SOMETIMES


---

## BOTH:
MEAN IS WHAT YOU ARE

MEAN IS EASIER THAN NICE


---


AND THOUGH MEAN CAN TAKE YOU FAR

MAYBE THIS WILL MAKE YOU THINK TWICE



---

## DAMIAN:
Kick! Layout! Fosse!


---

## BOTH:
THIS IS A CAUTIONARY TALE

ABOUT CORRUPTION AND BETRAYAL!


---

## DAMIAN:
AND GETTING HIT BY A BUS!


---

## JANIS:
YOU CAN'T BUY INTEGRITY AT THE MALL

IT'S NOT FOR SALE


---

## DAMIAN:
Nice!


---

## JANIS:
Thank you!


---

## BOTH:
THIS IS A CAUTIONARY TALE


---

## DAMIAN:
Our story begins across the globe in Africa... Africa!


---

## WOMEN:
HO OH, HO OH

HI-YYA, HI-YYA


---

## MEN:
HO OH, HO OH

HI-YYA, HI-YYA


---

## MRS. HERON:
Cady! Harakisha, Binti! It's almost time to go!


---

## CADY:
I'll be right there! I'm saying goodbye.


---

## CADY:
I’M SIXTEEN LIVING IN PARADISE

WITH JUST ANIMALS FOR FRIENDS

BUT TODAY, MY LIFE IN KENYA ENDS


---

DON'T BE SAD, WE KNEW THIS WAS COMING,
ADN LIFE OFTEN HAS GOODBYES

YOU'RE KILLERS, BUT I'M GONNA MISS YOU GUYS.


---

SOMEWHERE OUT THERE IS A DIFF'RENT KIND OF PRIDE,
PRE'RABLY ONE THAT WON'T EAT ME IF I DIED.

HUMAN KIDS WHO MIGHT EVEN WALK UPRIGHT,

---

DID YOU EVER GET A FEELING

EVERYBODY ELSE IS HAPPY


---


EVERYBODY ELSE HAS FRIENDS

AND THEY’RE BETTER FRIENDS THAN YOURS


---


IT’S A VERY RECENT FEELING

BUT IT’S RUNNING THROUGH MY BODY


---


AND IT ROARS

IT ROARS



---

## MRS. HERON:
Cady honey, have a Kalteen bar. It's a long ride to Jomo Kenyatta. 

---

I’m sorry I had to take this new job, Cady. 

---

It breaks my heart to take you away from the only home you've ever known.


---

## CADY:
Mom. It's okay

---

## MRS. HERON:
But the United States is so-

---

## CADY & MR. HERON:
..."politically unstable and everyone's on opiods"

---

## CADY:
Mommy, I'm not afraid.


---

## MRS. HERON:
My fearless girl.


---

## MR. HERON:
You ready?


---

## CADY:
So ready.


---

## CADY:
I HAVE DANCED WITH THE MASSAI.

I HAVE CLIMBED KILIMANJARO


---


WHO KNOWS WHAT I WILL DO TOMORROW?

WILL DO TOMORROW?



---


DID YOU EVER GET A FEELING

THAT A WHOLE NEW WORLD IS WAITING


---


TO BRING HAPPINESS AND FRIENDS

TO THE BRAVE GIRL WHO EXPLORES


---


IT'S A SCARY KIND OF FEELING,
BUT IT'S SO EXHILARATING

## MS. NORBURY:
Okay. Cady, hi. I'm Ms. Norbury. I'll be your homeroom teacher. Here's your roster. I see I also have you in AP Calculus. You must have had excellent teachers at your old school.


---

## CADY:
I was home-schooled

---

## MS. NORBURY:
Homeschooled. That's a fun way to steal money from my union.



---

## CADY:
Right, no, um, my parents are biologists and we've been living in Kenya. But yeah, I love Calculus.


---

## MS. NORBURY:
That's the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me. And I've been married twice.

Okay, think you can follow this schedule?


---

## CADY:
I think so.


---

## MS. NORBURY:
Well, don't be shy. This can be overwhelming for a home-schooled student. You're gonna be moving from class to class with each-

---


## MR. BUCK:
This is first period, American Literature. My name is Mr. Buck-

---

## JANIS:
You don't want to sit there. Dawn Schweitzer saves that seat for her boyfriend.

## DAMIAN:

So let's get out there and pick your new life.

Okay, let's dive right in, friends. Chapter one," Limits and Their Properties'' 

---

What the heck are limits you say? If I write out the equation...


---

## MS. NORBURY:
"The limit as 'X' approaches two of 'X' plus one," the function is what we're taking the limit of. 

---

I don't expect you to know yet-

---

## CADY:
"X" equals three.



---

## MS. NORBURY:
That's right, actually. Let's try another one. 

---

"Find the value of 'K' for which the following limit exists." 

---

For the limit to exist we have to cancel (x minus three) from the denominator-

---

## CADY:
"K" equals negative three.


---

## MS. NORBURY:
Yes!



---

## KEVIN G:
Damn, girl!


---

## AARON:
Wow. Are you trying to make the rest of us feel dumb?


---

## CADY:
I'm not trying to. It's just happening.


---

## AARON:
Okya. Challenge accepted. I'm gonna have to play at your level. 

---

Like how J.R. Smith got better when LeBron J-

---

## CADY:
WHEN I WAS FIVE, I FELL IN LOVE,THIS PEACE CORPS GUY

I BARED MY SHOULD BESIDE THE WATER HOLE


---


WHICH MADE HIM LAUGH.

WHICH MADE ME CRY


---

## AARON:
Ms. Norburry is tough and a little weird, but you get to like her eventually.


---

## CADY:
Like snake meat.


---


BY THIRTEEN I GAVE UP TRYING

I DECIDED I WOULD BE A MATHEMATICIAN...


---


'CAUSE MATH IS REAL

I MEMORIZED A LOT OF PI


---


BECAUSE ADDITIONS AND SUBTRACTIONS AND DIVISION

WOULD NEVER MAKE ME FEEL SO



---


STUPID WITH LOVE

I DIDN'T GET IT

I DIDN'T GET IT, SOMEHOW


---


SMART WITH MATH BUT STUPID WITH LOVE

I DIDN'T GET IT

I DIDN'T GET IT...


---


'TILL NOW


---

## AARON:
Do you have an eraser?


---

## CADY:
I would love to

---


SO THANK YOU, MATH, FOR BEING THERE

TO BRING ME JOY


---


AND THANK YOU, MATH

'CAUSE NOW BROUGHT ME THIS CUTE BOY!


---

## AARON:
Is it two?


---

## MS. NORBURY:
Yes!




---

## CADY:
HE'S LIKE SOMEONE FROM T.V

HE'S LIKE THAT GUY WHO GIVE OUT ROSES TO THOSE WOMEN


---


HIS CLOTHES, HIS GROOMING

AND HE'S FOOT AWAY FROM ME: 

---

WITH DREAMY SMILE  AND SHINY EYES THAT I COULD SWIM IN

HE IS LIVE AND IN THE ROOM!




---

## ENSEMBLE:
HOO


HOO. HOO



---


HOO.

HOO.


---

## CADY:
AND I'M STUPID WITH LOVE

I WANNA GET IT


---


I WANNA TO GET IT, BUT HOW?

SMART WITH MATH, BUT STUPID WITH LOVE


---


I WANNA GET IT

I DIDN'T GET IT 'TILL NOW



---

## AARON & CADY:
Two over zero is undefined

---

## AARON:
Jinx.


---

## CADY:
I'M ASTOUNDED AND NON-PLUSSED

I AM FILLED WITH CALCULUST


---


DOES THIS GUY WORK OUT? HE MUST

ALL SWEATY AT THE GYM


---


COULD THAT IMAGE BE MORE HOT?

LET ME JUST ENJOY THAT THOUGHT...


---


SCHOOL WAS ROUGH BUT NOW? IT'S NOT

'CAUSE NOW THERE'S HIM


---


IT'S ALL SO SIMPLE


---

## CADY:
STUPID WITH LOVE

BUT I CAN GET IT

WATCH THIS GIRL SELF-EDUCATE


---


I LEARNED MATH, SO 
I CAN LEARN LOVE


---


YOU WANNA BET IT?

THAT I CAN GET IT?


---


JUST WAIT

JUST WAIT

JUST WAIT!


---

## ENSEMBLE:
AH-HOO

HMM

AH-HOO HMM


---

## JANIS:
The color pink is not universally linked with femininity. In India, men wear pink turbans to religious festivals.


---

## DAMIAN:
In Switzerland, they paint prison cells pink, to keep the inmates calm. Which is fine!


---

## JANIS:
But here in Western Culture, pink is for girls...and spies.


---

## GRETCHEN:
You can't wear a tank top two days in a row and you can only wear your hair in a ponytail once a week. So, I guess you picked today. 

---

Oh, and we only wear sweats or track pants on Fridays. 

---

If you break any of these rules, you can't sit with us at lunch. I mean, not just you, like, any of us. 

---

Like, if I were wearing sweatpants today, I'd have to sit over there with the Art Freaks.


---

## CADY:
That seems fair.


---

## REGINA:
A hundred and twenty calories and forty-eight calories from fat. What percent is that?


---

## GRETCHEN:
Forty-eight into a hundred and twenty?


---

## KAREN:
There's no way of knowing.


---

## REGINA:
I'm only eating foods with less than thirty percent calories from fat.


---

## CADY:
It's forty percent. Forty-eight over a hundred and twenty equals "x? 

---

Over a hundred, and then you cross-multiple and get the value of "x".


---

## REGINA:
Whatever. I'm getting cheese fries.


---

## KEVIN G:
Yo, Africa, those fractions were tight.


---


I'm KEVIN G. Captain of the North Shore Mathletes. 

---

We're a very chill dope crew. Also, Ms. Norbury says we'd get twice as much funding if we had a girl. 

---

So think about joining. Because we'd like to get jackets.


---

## CADY:
Oh. Um-

---

## GRETCHEN:
You can't join Mathletes. It's social suicide.


---

## REGINA:
Mathlets? Ew, no. Why is he by our table?


---

## KEVIN G:
I can hear you by the way.


---

## REGINA:
Can you hear me now?


---

## KEVIN G:
Take my card in case you change your mind. 

---

I also deejay and I designed that font.

That's my landline, so my mom might answer in Russian...Peace!


---

## REGINA:
Damn. You are so lucky you have us to guide you. 

---

Meet me after school. I'm gonna take you to the mall and buy you some shoes.


---

## DAMIAN:
What did she say?



---

## CADY:
Did you see how she chewed up that boy to protect me?


---

## JANIS:
Yea, she's rude.


---

## CADY:
No. She's the apex predator

---

## DAMIAN:
The what?


---

## CADY:
The alpha. They’re predators, but if you're on their good side, you can have a symbiotic of commensal relationship-

---

## JANIS:
Regina George has no good side! It's like you said, Caddy. She's a predator.



---


DON'T BE FOOLED BY THE PINK

SHE IS NOT PLAYING DOLLS


---


SHE IS STALKING THE HALLS

FOR THE THRILL OF THE KILL


---


EVERY PERSON IN SCHOOL, IS AWARE OF HER STARE

WHEN SHE TOSSES HER HAIR THEY GO PERFECTLY STILL


---


ALL THEIR EYES SAY, "DON'T ATTACK ME."
WATCH THEM SWEAT AND PANT AND SHAKE


---


EVERY FOOD CHAIN HAS ITS ACME: REGINA GEORGE EATS STEAK

SHE'S THE QUEEN OF THE BEASTS


---


SHE CAN SMELL YOUR FEAR

IN THIS BIOSPHERE


---


SHE'S THE APEX PREDATOR

LIKE A LIONESS,

---


ONLY WITH LESS FUR,
DO NOT MESS WITH HER

SHE'S THE APEX PREDATOR.



---

## CAITLYN CAUSSIN:
Regina George saved my life once!' 

---

Cause one time at Wiener Circle, she saw that I was choking, and she told me to stop choking. And I did!


---

## RACHEL HAMILTON:
Regina George is considered the prettiest girl in school. And I'm like, okay, but when did we vote?


---

## SOPHIE K.:
When REgina George is around, I feel like no one can even see me. Like I don't even-

---

## LIZZIE THERMAN:
They tell us to be ourselves. They tell us looks don't matter. 

---

And then they literally have a school contest every year where we give Regina a crown. 

---

This is why I have to be high every day.


---

## REGINA:
Cady, come here. I'm gonna buy you those suede heels cause you need more.


---

## CADY:
More what?


---

## REGINA:
More shoes, more height, more style, more butt lift- trust me, more is better.


---

## GRETCHEN & KAREN:
The Shoes! Buy them! Buy, buy!


---

## CADY:
AT THE WATERING HOLE

SEE THE GIRLS WHO WEREN'T NICE


---


HAVE TO SCATTER LIKE MICE

FROM A JUNGLE CAT



---


AND THOUGH JANIS IS GREAT

SHE DOES NOT HAVE THIS POWER


---


PEOPLE LITERALLY COWER

JANIS CAN'T DO THAT



---


SEE US MARK OUR TERRITORY

AS I FOLLOW IN HER TRAIN


---


I WAS VICTIM, I WAS QUARRY

NOW I SHAKE MY MANE



---


SHE'S THE QUEEN OF BEASTS, AND I'M IN HER PRIDE

I HAVE HITCHED A RIDE WITH THE APEX PREDATOR


---


AND IT'S KINDA FUN, WHEN SHE BARES HER CLAWS

WHEN I'M SAFE BECAUSE

I'M WITH THE APEX PREDATOR



---

## GRETCHEN:
So have you seen any guys you think are cute yet?h!


---

## CADY:
There's this guy in my calculus class. Aaron Samuels?


---

## GRETCHEN:
Kaaa-kaaa-kaah! No! That's Regina's ex-boyfriend! 

---

He just broke up with her this summer.


---

## KAREN:
I thought she dumped him for Shane Oman?


---

## GRETCHEN:
Irregardless! Ex-boyfriends are off limits to friends. 

---

That's just, like, the rules of feminism.

Don't worry. I'll never tell Regina what you said.


---

## GRETCHEN & KAREN:
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!


---

## CADY:
DID I THINK I'D BE PROTECTED

BY MY NEW EXOTIC PET


---


NOT A CHANCE IF SHE SUSPECTED

I WAS ANY KIND OF REPRODUCTIVE THREAT


---


BUT SHE DOESN'T KNOW YET,NO,

---

## CADY & JANIS:
SHE DOESN'T KNOW YET



---


SHE'S THE QUEEN OF BEASTS AT THIS BEASTLY SCHOOL

GOTTA KEEP THINGS COOL WITH THE APEX PREDATOR


---

## CADY:
SO I'M KINDA FRIENDS


---

## JANIS:
BUT YOU'RE KIND OF PREY


---

## CADY:
JESUS, WHAT A DAY


---

## CADY & JANIS:
WITH THE APEX PREDATOR

WILL SHE BRAID YOUR HAIR


---


WILL SHE EAT YOUR HEART

HOW CAN YOU OUTSMART


---


THE APEX PREDATOR


---

## CADY:
Wow. Your room is really nice.


---

## REGINA:
I know, right? It was my parents' room, but I made them trade me.

Gretchen, move.


---

## GRETCHEN:
Sorry! Ugh, my hips are so wide.


---

## REGINA:
I need to lose three pounds.


---

## KAREN:
My ankles are like dog angles.


---

## CADY:
I'm not sure what we're doing, but...me too. I'm ugly too.


---

## MRS. GEORGE:
O.F.M, you guys are so busted!


---

## GRETCHEN & KAREN:
Hi, Mrs. George!


---

## MRS. GEORGE:
Did you fly bitches come in through the garage? I didn't even hear you."

---

## REGINA:
Maybe that was on purpose.



---

## MRS. GEORGE:
Well, who are you?! We haven't had new meat in our little lady taco in so long!


---

## REGINA:
Mom.


---

## CADY:
I'm Cady Heron. I just moved here.


---

## KAREN:
From Africa!


---

## MRS. GEORGE:
Well welcome Cady, welcome to America.



---

Have you seen any guys you think are cute yet?


---

## CADY:
Um..no.


---

## MRS. GEORGE:
Well it's just a matter of time. 

---

I always say, this school district has the highest taxes but the hottest boys, so-

---

## REGINA:
Ew.


---

## MRS. GEORGE:
Oh Regina! You'll never guess what I found in the back of your closet!


---

## REGINA:
Why were you in my closet?


---

## MRS. GEORGE:
I was doing that Japanese organizing thing where you take a little nap in a closet. 

---

Anyway, I found your-
Buuuurnbooooooook! 

---

Cady, this was just the funniest thing they used to do.-

---

## REGINA:
Mommy, get out.


---

## MRS. GEORGE:
You got it baby. But I'll be right downstairs if you guys need to talk to me about anything, okay? 

---

Deep stuff, boy troubles, blackheads, alcohol poisoning- 

---

I've been through it all! I'm not a "regular mom," 

---

I'm coolmom! "@coolmom". Twenty-three hundred followers. Likesforlikes. 

---

Hashtag belly tea. Hashtag ad.


---

## REGINA:
Mom! You don't say hashtag ad if no one's paying you!


---

## MRS. GEORGE:
Oh that reminds me Ri-gi. I need your tech help. 

---

I think I accidentally Marco-polo'ed your dad's boss from the toilet again.


---

## REGINA:
Oooout!


---

## MRS. GEORGE:
Mhmmm you gals, have so much fun! Enjoy your tiny butts 'cause it's all gonna go.


---

## KAREN:
Oh my God, we haven't looked at this Burn Book in forever.


---

## GRETCHEN:
Check it out, Cady. We cut out people's pictures from the yearbook and then we wrote comments.



---

“Trang Pak is a grotsky little beyotch"

---

## REGINA:
Still true.


---

## GRETCHEN:
"Dawn Schweitzer is a fat virgin"

---

## REGINA:
Still half true.


---

## GRETCHEN:
"Janis Sarkisian. Space-lez" I forgot about that. 

---

## REGINA:
Oh my God, she's so weird.


---

## CADY:
She is? She's in my homeroom.


---

## REGINA:
Well watch out cause she's mental. 

---

People think she's really good at art but it's cause she had to do "art therapy."

---

## GRETCHEN:
Regina and Janis were best friends in middle school.


---

## REGINA:
She was, like, obsessed with me. 

---

Then when I couldn't invite her to my 13th birthday 'cause my mom said I could only have six people, she went insane.


---

## KAREN:
Who's that?


---

## GRETCHEN:
That's that kid Damian.


---

## CADY:
Yea, he's almost too gay to function.



---

I didn't mean that in a bad way-

---

## REGINA:
No. That’s funny. Put that in there.




---

## GRETCHEN:
Cady, don't worry. We only write stuff about "randos" in here. 

---

Friends are, like, very deserving of respect and-

---

## REGINA:
-Gretchen, she gets it.



---

Karen, come with me. I wanna change your eyebrows.


---

## KAREN:
Can I still have two?


---

## GRETCHEN:
Do you need me to come with, or...? I could film it-?



---

Okay! So are you having so much fun with us?


---

## CADY:
Yeah! How long were Regina and Aaron a couple?


---

## GRETCHEN:
All last year. Did Regina seem mad at me?


---

## CADY:
I don't know. Is she the kind of girl that he likes usually? With makeup and stuff?


---

## GRETCHEN:
Ues. She did seem mad at me, I think. It started when I burped in the car. 

---

But I'm talking too much. Let's talk about you. Are you a virgin?


---

## CADY:
What?


---

## GRETCHEN:
You don't have to tell me. But just know that I'm very trustworthy. 

---

Karen's had sex with eleven people and I've never told anyone. 

---

## CADY:
That's good of you.


---

## GRETCHEN:
They're laughing!



---

What? What happened that was funny?


---

## CADY:
Are you okay?


---

## GRETCHEN:
Mnhmmmm. Mmhmmm. It's just...sometimes I feel like an iphone without a case. 

---

Like, I know I'm worth a lot, and I have a lot of good functions, but at any time I could just shatter.


---

## GRETCHEN:
TELL ME WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME

MY BODY, FACE, MY HAIR


---


TELL ME ALL MY MANY FAULTS

TELL ME LIKE YOU CARE


---


WHEN WE BOTH KNOW YOU'RE CRUEL

AND WE BOTH KNOW YOU'RE RIGHT


---


I COULD LISTEN TO YOU

LIKE A FOOL ALL NIGHT



---


WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?

HOW I SPEAK?

HOW I DRESS?


---


WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?

YOU KEEP ME GUESSING.



---


MAMA CALLED ME "BEAUTIFUL"
DON'T BELIEVE HER ANYMORE.


---


NOW I'M LISTENING TO YOU.

WHAT DO I DO THAT FOR?


---


PLEASE DON'T IGNORE ME

MM...



---


TELL ME WHO WE HATE TODAY

AND I WILL FALL IN LINE


---


HUG ME WHILE MY SHOULDERS TENSE

AND WE'LL PRETEND WE'RE FINE


---


THOUGH WE BOTH KNOW ONE DAY

THERE'LL BE BLOOD ON THE FLOOR


---


BUT WHICH ONE WILL BETRAY THE OTHER MORE?



---

## CADY:
I'm gonna go home now.


---

## GRETCHEN:
Okay. Fun. See you tomorrow!


---


WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME? WHERE'S MY MIND?

WHERE DOES IT END? MAYBE I NEED TO FIND

A BETTER FRIEND?


---


WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME? WHAT CAN I DO?

WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME? COULD IT BE YOU?


---


-IT'S PROB'LY ME SEE THAT? YOU SEE?

WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?


---


MM...MM...MM..



---

## CADY:
-and they have this book. 

---

This Burn Book where they write mean things about girls in our grade.



---

## JANIS:
What does it say about me?


---

## CADY:
You're not in it.


---

## JANIS:
Those bitches!


---

## DAMIAN:
What is this? Can I eat it?


---

## CADY:
It's a Kalteen bar.

My mom used to give them to the kids in Africa to help them gain weight.


---

## DAMIAN:
I can feel it working,

---

## JANIS:
We should grind those up and put them in Regina's food-

---

## CADY:
Nooo, Janis! I'll keep eating lunch with them. That's it!


---

## DAMIAN:
And so she did! Cady spent weeks pretending to like Regina.


---

## JANIS:
And for real liking Aaron in the "safe space" of AP Calculus.



---

## AARON:
New shoes?


---

## CADY:
Yea. Regina brought them for me.


---

## AARON:
I didn't know you guys were friends.


---

## CADY:
Yea., you just broke up with her last summer right?


---

## AARON:
Wow, is that how she's telling it?


---

## CADY:
No, forget I said that. Home-schooled wierdo! Sorry!


---

## AARON:
No it's fine

---

## AARON:
IT'S ALL ON ME,
WITH HER I TRIED TO BE


---


SOMEBODY COOL.


---

## CADY:
You're already cool.


---

## AARON:
Thanks.


---


THAT'S LOVE I GUESS:
YOU TRY HARD TO IMPRESS,
BUT END UP ACTING LIKE A TOOL.




---

## AARON:
I FIND THE WHOLE THING SO  FRUSTRATING.



---



SO I'M SWEARING OFF OF DATING.



---


I JUST GET STUPID WITH LOVE.

I JUST DON'T GET IT.



---


I JUST DON'T GET IT.



---


SOMEHOW.

ALL I GET IS STUPID WITH LOVE.

I JUST DON'T GET IT.

---


Shit.


---

STUPID WITH LOVE


I'LL NEVER GET I



---


I'LL NEVER GET IT

HOW?

ALL I GET IS STUPID WITH LOVE



---

I'LL NEVER GET IT




---

## AARON:
You'll never get what?


---

## CADY:
What? Um. This problem! I don't get any of it.


---

## AARON:
It's a factorial. You multiply it?


---

## CADY:
Ohhhh. Thanks. You're so smart.


---

## JANIS:
Okay, don't sleep on that! 

---

She just pretended to be dumb to get a boy to keep talking to her. And it worked. 

---

'Cause that shit always works.


---

## AARON:
Hey. We're having a party at my friend Chris' this weekend. You wanna come?


---

## CADY:
Me?


---

## AARON:
Yes. It's a Halloween party. People get pretty into it.


---

## CADY:
Grool.

I meant to say "great" but then I started to say "cool".


---

## AARON:
Okay, grool.


---

## CADY:
STUPID WITH LOVE BUT NOW I GET IT.

Sex cancer doesn't exist.

---


I'm a sexy mouse

---

## ALL (EXCEPT CADY):
Aagh!


---

## KAREN:
Why are you dressed so scary?!


---

## CADY:
It's Halloween.


---

## GRETCHEN:
If you don't dress slutty, that's "slut shaming" us.


---

## REGINA:
Gretchen! Why did you invite Cady? We don't have to take her everywhere you know.


---

## GRETCHEN:
I didn't!


---

## REGINA:
And honestly you shouldn't want her around ' cause she's kind of "off-brand cute" in the same way you are, only fresher.


---

## GRETCHEN:
Thank you for your feedback.



---

But she came by herself 'cause she's obsessed with this guy from her math class or something-

---

## REGINA:
She likes a senior? That's a little "confident." Who is it?


---

## GRETCHEN:
Uuuuuuummm...


---

## AARON:
Hey! You made it! I like your costume. It's different from everybody else.


---

## CADY:
I didn't know I was supposed to look- ugh. I'm such a weird foreign loser!


---

## AARON:
No. Everyone feels like that when they're the new kid. I only moved here like two years ago. 

---

Well, that's not really true. I didn't actually move here. My mom lies about our address so that I can be in the North Shore school district. 

---

Please don't tell anyone that!


---

## CADY:
No! Of course!


---

## AARON:
How'd you do on that pop quiz today? 'Cause I got an eighty-five.


---

## CADY:
I got a hundred-
-things wrong. I think I need extra help.


---

## AARON:
I could tutor you if you ever want-

---

## CADY:
Thank you, that would be tits.


---

## AARON:
Okay then, it's a deal. Let me get you a drink. Wait right here.



---

## REGINA:
I know your secret.


---

## CADY:
Secret?


---

## REGINA:
Gretchen told me you like Aaron Samuels.


---

## CADY:
Gretchen what? I'm sorry, I- I didn't know-

---

## REGINA:
I don't care. I think you guys would be a cute couple.


---

## CADY:
Really?


---

## REGINA:
I just said so. Don't be so thirsty.



---

I could talk to him for you if you want.


---

## CADY:
You would do that? Nothing embarrassing right?


---

## REGINA:
Duh!


---

## REGINA:
I have to talk to you.


---

## AARON:
Me? I thought you were done talking to me last summer when you started "talking to" Shane-

---

## REGINA:
Don't be weird. Okay, you know how that Cady girl just showed up here tonight-

---

## AARON:
She's not crashing, I invited her.


---

## REGINA:
No, I know. Just, like, be careful. 'Cause she has a huge crush on you.


---

## AARON:
Really?

## REGINA:
Don't be gross. She's my friend, and she's really babyish and inexperienced and-


---

-wow. I didn't think this would be so hard for me.

Just promise me you won't break her heart like you did mine.


---

## AARON:
Wait, what's happening?

BUT IT'S ALL SHOW.

---

## REGINA:
'TIL SOMEONE GETS-

---

## ENSEMBLE:
AAAH-AH! AAAH-AH!

AAAH-AH! AAAH-AH!


---

## REGINA:
'TIL SOMEONE GETS HURT

'TIL SOMEONE GETS HURT



---

## CADY:
Noooooooooooooo!


---

## JANIS & DAMIAN:
Aaagh!


---

## CADY:
She took him back! She took Aaron back!


---

## JANIS:
Of course, she did, Caddy. She's a life ruiner.


---

## DAMIAN:
When we were in the eighth grade she-

---

## JANIS:
Damian, she doesn't need to hear-

---

## CADY:
Guys, I know the story! She didn't invite you to her 13th birthday ‘cause she could only have six people.


---

## DAMIAN:
She said what?!? Oh Regina is a hot liar!



---

NO! I must! 

---

What actually happened was Regina came up to Janis before school where no adults could see her and was like...


---

## DAMIAN:
"Janis, I can't invite you to my pool party, 'cause I think you're a lesbian."

---

## JANIS:
Damian!


---

## REGINA:
Janis, I can't invite you to my pool party, 'cause I think you're a lesbian. 

---

And I can't have a lesbian at my party. There's gonna be girls there in their bathing suits.


---

## DAMIAN:
She just kept asking her.


---

## REGINA:
I mean, are you a lesbian?! What are you?


---

## CADY:
What did Janis say?



---

## DAMIAN:
What could she say? It wasn't a real question. 

---

It was just, like, an attempt to snatch her dignity. And she didn't know why her friend was doing this to her. 

---

So she just yelled-

---

## JANIS:
I'm a space alien and I have four butts.


---

## DAMIAN:
It was a bad choice, but she was twelve. 

---

And by lunch someone had sharpied "Space-lez” on her locker. 

---

After that no one would talk to her and it got really bad and her parents pulled her out of school for the rest of the year.


---

## JANIS:
It's not even true. I only have one butt.


---

## CADY:
I'm sorry-

---

## JANIS:
Don't be sorry! Now you know, Caddy. Regina George is not your friend. We're your friends. And we're gonna make her pay.


---


YOU KNOW WHAT FRIENDS DO?

THEY'VE GOT YOUR BACK

AND THEY'RE FUN TO BE AROUND!


---

## DAMIAN:
WHUH-OH, WHUH-OH, WHOA!



---

## JANIS:
WHEN SOMEONE HURTS YOU THEN THEY ATTACK

AND GRIND YOUR FOE INTO THE GROUND



---

## DAMIAN:
WHUH-OH, WHUH-OH, WHOA!



---

## JANIS:
IMAGINE A PARTY,
WITH DRESSES AND CAKE

AND SINGING AND DANCING AND CAKE!



---


AND THERE'S A MAGIC ACT THAT SAWS REGINA IN HALF

AND THIS TIME IT WILL TAKE


---

## DAMIAN:
Now that's a party.



---

## JANIS:
A REVENGE PARTY!

A PARTY THAT ENDS WITH SOMEBODY'S HEAD ON A SPIKE!


---

## DAMIAN:
WHO-A-WHOA!


---

## JANIS & DAMIAN:
IT'S A REVENGE PARTY!

WITH YOUR TWO BEST FRIENDS!

IT'S LIKE A PARTY WITH REVENGE IT'S WHAT IT'S LIKE!


---

## JANIS:
I've dreamed of this day for many years, but I never had an "inside man"

---

## DAMIAN:
I almost did once. At Summer Camp. But I got nervous-

---

## JANIS:
First, we destroy her hotness. But how?


---

## CADY:
I know how!


---

## JANIS & DAMIAN:
The Kalteen Bars!


---

## JANIS:
OKAY, FOR THIS TO WORK. You're gonna have to pretend like you still like them
Can you do it?


---

## CADY:
Watch me.


---

## CADY:
IT'S A REVENGE PARTY

A PARTY THAT ENDS WITH ENTRAILS ALL OVER THE LAWN.


---

## JANIS & DAMIAN:
WHUH-OH!WHOA!



---

## JANIS, DAMIAN, & CADY:
IT'S A REVENGE PARTY!

WITH YOUR TWO BEST FRIENDS,

---

## CADY:
AND THEN I END UP WITH AARON WHEN SHE'S GONE


---

## JANIS & DAMIAN:
Yass, bitch! 

---

## CADY:
I END UP WITH AARON WHEN SHE'S GONE



---

## CADY:
Hey, girl!


---

## GRETCHEN:
What is that?


---

## CADY:
Ugh. I'm so fat and disgusting! I use these Kallteen diet bars when I need to lose weight.


---

## REGINA:
I need to lose three pounds. How many calories from fat?


---

## CADY:
Zero. You cross-multiply x over a thousand and then divide it by point five 'cause it's kilograms-

---

## REGINA:
Whatever. Bring me a whole box.



---

## JANIS, DAMIAN, & CADY:
A REVENGE PARTY A PARTY THAT ENDS

WITH SOMEBODY CRUSHED AND ALONE!


---

## JANIS:
AND UGLY CRYING


---

## JANIS & DAMIAN:
IT'S A REVENGE PARTY!

WITH YOUR TWO BEST FRIENDS!

IT'S LIKE A PARTY AND REVENGE IS WHAT WE'RE THROW'N!

IS SHE DATING AARON?


---


REGINA, REGINA, REGINA, SHE HAS EVERYTHING

SHE GETS EVERYTHING!


---


REGINA, REGINA, REGINA


---

## JANIS:
Step numero two. If we make Gretchen Weiners think Regina is mad at her...



---

## CADY:
No. I won't do that, Gretchen is fragile-

---

## JANIS:
Exactly. And if we crack her open, she will spill something we can use.


---

## CADY:
Shh, here she comes.


---


Hey, girl. You sending any candy canes?


---

## REGINA:
I don't send them. I just get them. Cady, settle an argument. Are his eyes grey or green?


---

## CADY:
They're green.


---

## REGINA:
No, I say they're grey.


---

## AARON:
I'll see you in Calc.



---

## JANIS:
AT EVERY PARTY, THERE MIGHT BE A LULL

WHERE THE ENERGY DIPS



---

## DAMIAN:
WHUH-OH, WHUH-OH, WHOA!

YOU MIGHT BE THINKING

"IT'S LATE WE SHOULD GO,AND THEY RAN OUT OF CHIPS"

---

## CADY:
No! no! No!



---


I CAN'T EVEN WATCH WHEN SHE TOUCHES HIS HAIR

AND I'VE WATCHED A SNAKE EAT A COW!


---


REGINA NEEDS TO BE TOPPLED

-SORRY, GRETCHEN- I SWEAR


---


WE'LL GET OUR PARTY NOW!

---

## DAMIAN:
And one for Cady Heron.


---

## ENSEMBLE:
SHE GETS EVERYTHING


---

## DAMIAN:
Four for Glen Coco, you go Glen Coco!


---

## ENSEMBLE:
GLEN COCCO! GLEN COCCO! GLEN COCCO!



---

## DAMIAN:
And none for Gretchen Wieners, bye

---

## GRETCHEN:
Who sent that?



---

## CADY:
Aw, it's from-

---

## ENSEMBLE:
REGINA! REGINA! REGINA!


---

## CADY:
"Thanks for being a such a great best friend."



---

## GRETCHEN:
Kaaaaah! I mean cuuuuute! 

---

I mean-Gimme it! I mean- 

---

Okay. Well, if you and Regina are "best friends" now, You can be in charge of keeping all her secrets. 

---

For example, she bought you those high heel shoes just to make fun of you 'Cause she knew you wouldn't be able to walk in them 

---

Also, she says her Landrover was a gift, but they lease it. 

---

Also, she totally cheats on Aaron. Every Thursday she says she has SAT Prep, but really, she's hooking up with Shane Oman in the North Shore Lion's Costume!


---

## CADY:
She makes him wear the costume?


---

## GRETCHEN:
No, they're both in the costume! And I never told anybody because I'm such a good friend

---


## JANIS, DAMIAN & CADY:
IT'S A REVENGE PARTY! A PARTY THAT ENDS

## ALL:

---

## AARON:
Hey, are we studying today?


---

## CADY:
Yeah...did you get that text I sent you?


---

## AARON:
I dunno
""I hate to be the one to tell you this but...Regionals is chewing on you"?


---

## CADY:
Oh no! Autocorrect! Regina is cheating on you.


---

## AARON:
"in the..." What was "lion suit" supposed to be?


---

## CADY:
It's supposed to be "lion suit".


---

## AARON:
Why would you tell me this?


---

## CADY:
Because you deserve to know. If you want to talk about it-

---

## AARON:
No. I definitely don't . I'm...I gotta go home.


---

## CADY:
Aaron-


---

## MS. NORBURY:
Cady, I noticed you failed your last few quizzes.


---

## CADY:
Yea. Sorry. I'll try harder.


---

## MS. NORBURY:
If you want to come after school today, there's a Mathletes meeting. We could review-

---

## CADY:
I can't. I have to go to my friend Regina's house. We're doing a dance in the Talent Show-

---

## MS. NORBURY:
"Rockin' Around the Pole"?!


---

## CADY:
Yeah. How did you-

---

## MS. NORBURY:
They do it every year. It's like a whaddyacallit-

---

## CADY:
A tradition?


---

## MS. NORBURY:
-A recurring nightmare. All right, listen. I can probably get Kevin or Martin to tutor you-

---

## CADY:
Aaron Samuels is tutoring me now, so..


---

## MS. NORBURY:
He's tutoring you. Okay. Sure. 

---

Well, tell him the weird thing with your quizzes is that all the work is right, and just the answers are wrong.


---

## CADY:
Huh.



---

## MS. NORBURY:
Huh. I'm not gonna stop pushing you, Cady. 

---

'Cause I'm a pusher. And I know you're smarter than this. 

---

Maybe I should just push your seat away from Aaron's.


---

## CADY:
"And then she was like, "I'm a Pusher."

---

## GRETCHEN:
Wait, what does she mean, she's a "pusher"? Like a drug pusher?!


---

## GRETCHEN:
I don't know! Maybe. She's so weird.


---

## GRETCHEN:
Let it all out, honey. Put it in the book.


---

## REGINA:
This skirt won't close. Cady, these Kalteen bars suck.


---

## CADY:
No, you have to make sure you eat enough carbs to...activate them.


---

## REGINA:
Stop playing with that stupid babyish book and help me find a safety pin!


---

## KAREN:
Be nice to her. She's really grouchy 'cause Aaron broke up with her.


---

## REGINA:
Karen, I can see your bra.


---

## KAREN:
It's on purpose. I'm going for a look.


---

## REGINA:
Is it "girl who's slept with eleven people"? 'Cause you're nailing it. 


---

## GRETCHEN:
I think your top looks fetch.


---

## REGINA:
Gretchen, stop trying to make fetch happen! It's not going to happen!


---

## CADY:
Wow. How much longer are you guys gonna put up with this?


---

## MS. DUVALL:
All right, a round of applause for the Drama Club's Mike T and Sarah, acting out a scene from the movie...Transformers. 

---

Really good Transforming, guys. 

---

Now listen, I shouldn't have to remind you guys, this is a voluntary talent show, not a contest, so there should never be a reason for you to yell the word, "Suck!" I don't want to hear that again. 

---

You got me?



---

Our next act describes their music as "Like a sine wave, we don't stop." Please welcome KEVIN G. And the Power of Three.


---

## KEVIN G:
Awwwwwwwww. Don't bring me no little-ass booty

---

## MS. DUVALL:
Nope! Inappropriate, Kevin, we talked about this!


---

## KEVIN G:
Happy holidays, everybody!


---

## MS. DUVALL:
Let's keep these acts "North Shore friendly" please. 

---

Also, if anyone finds a retainer in a bright aqua case, that is mine. 

---

Please return it. My insurance will not cover a replacement. 

---

Okay, please welcome for the sixth year in a row in this school district, the "Hot Elves" doing "Rockin' Around the Pole".


---

## REGINA:
Aagh!



---

## JANIS:
Okay, this is probably a good time to talk about the power of Social Media.


---

## DAMIAN:
Was it funny when Regina bent over and it looked like her butt ate her underwear? Yes. 

---

One million percent.


---

## JANIS:
Was it shocking that she stepped on Gretchen's face as she ran away? 

---

Not to me, but I still liked it.



---

## DAMIAN:
And why did Karen pretend to be asleep? Did she just panic?!? I think so.


---

## JANIS:
Now, we all know that harsh internet comments are "hurtful" and "cause pain" and "blah blah we gotta stop" etc.


---

## DAMIAN:
But what everyone forgets is that positive Internet comments are worse. 

---

'Cause they create a false sense of love and admiration, and they are more addictive than opioids and Girl Scout thin mints combined. 

---

For example:

---

## DAWN SCHWEITZER:
OMG! Cady was the only one who kept dancing!


---

## GRACE A:
Cady looked cute. Those other three were like my SAT words- hard, boring, and I already forgot them.


---

## RACHEL H:
Her instagram is just picture of lions and no selfies. She is goals.


---

## TYLER K.:
I would hit that. I would hit that.


---

## CAITLYN CAUSSIN:
Cady Heron is, like, effortlessly perfect. 

---

I would kill my whole family and eat glass for a hundred years to be that effortless.


---

## ALL GIRLS:
Follow. Follow. Follow. Follow. Follow. Follow.


---

## GRETCHEN:
I posted a picture of me and Cady in our Santa outfits and someone commented that we look like sisters. 

---

And I was like hashtag whaaaaa?


---

## KAREN:
I like Cady. She's nice to me.



---

## REGINA:
I mean, honestly, I wasn't the worst thing at that talent show. Wait. Is buttter a carb?


---

## CADY:
Yes.


---

## REGINA:
Gretchen, move!


---

## GRETCHEN:
I'm sorry Regina. You can't sit with us.


---

## REGINA:
What?


---

## GRETCHEN:
You're wearing sweatpants. It's Thursday.


---

## REGINA:
Whatever. Those rules aren't real.


---

## KAREN:
They were real the day I wore a vest!


---

## REGINA:
Because that vest was disgusting!


---

## GRETCHEN:
You can't sit with us! You can't...sit with us.



---

## REGINA:
These sweatpants are all that fit me right now.


---

## GRETCHEN:
What do you think, Cady? Cady?


---

## CADY:
Sorry, Regina, Rules are rules.


---

## REGINA:
Fine. Take a picture, losers! It'll last longer!


---

## GRETCHEN:
She left. She left.

WAIT. WHO IS MY BOSS NOW REGINA IS GONE?


---

## KAREN:
I'LL WEAR WHAT I WANT, WHICH IS WHAT I HAVE ON

AND A VEST!


---


THAT'S HOW IT FEELS

THIS CAUTIONARY TALE, THAT WE CONTINUE TO UNVEIL.


---

## JANIS:
THIS IS THE INSANE PART,
WHERE IT ALL FLIES OFF THE RAIL.



---

## DAMIAN:
Exciting.


---

## DAMIAN & JANIS:
ENJOY THE CAUTIONARY TALE.


---

## MS. DUVALL:

---

so we're just gonna get balloons. 

---

And finally, the nominees for Spring Fling King and Queen are as follows:

---

## JANIS:
Did you set that up?


---

## DAMIAN:
No.


---

## JANIS:
Oh boy.


---

## CADY:
Damian, did you do that?!


---

## DAMIAN:
It wasn't me. As junior co-chair of the Student Activities Committee, 

---

I would never tamper with election materials.


---

## CADY:
So I'm really nominated?


---

## JANIS:
Or it's the Russians?


---

## CADY:
Oh my God, so many people are texting me. Should I text Aaron and congratulate him?


---

## JANIS & DAMIAN:
No.


---

## CADY:
Cause the last couple texts I sent-

---

## JANIS & DAMIAN:
He hasn't answered./So you said, yes.


---

## CADY:
I mean he's been broken up with Regina for a month. Why hasn't he asked me out yet?


---

## DAMIAN:
I don't know, but I wish you'd keep telling us about it.


---

## JANIS:
Hey, do you need a ride this weekend? 'Cause Damian borrowed his grandmother's jazzy-

---

## CADY:
What?


---

## DAMIAN:
It's a motorized scooter-

---

## CADY:
No, I mean, ride to what?


---

## JANIS:
My art show. Did you not just hear Mr. Duvall talking about it?


---

## CADY:
That's this weekend?! Shoot, my parents and I have tickets to this thing in Madison. 

---

I'm so sorry!


---

## JANIS:
Yeah, you seem sad about it.


---

## CADY:
I have to post something about being nominated. Then you can tag Aaron and be like, "you should go together"-

---

## DAMIAN:
Girl!


---

## CADY:
Hey! What are you doing?


---

## DAMIAN:
Saving you from yourself. Caddy, I did a paper on this! Our prefrontal cortex isn't fully formed until we're twenty-five. 

---

It's why we're not allowed to rent cars! 

---

' Cause we will wreck them just to make a cool Boomerang.



---

## DAMIAN:
IRONICALLY, I NEED TO SCARE YOU STRAIGHT

BECAUSE THIS SHOULDN'T BE HOW WE ROLL


---


WE GET THESE IDEAS AND WE JUST CAN WAIT

BUT THERE IS A PRICE.


---



YOU WANT TO DO-SLASH-HAVE IT ALL,
BECAUSE YOU HAVE NO IMPULSE CONTROL


---



SO BEFORE YOU SNAP, TAG, LIKE- OR GOD FORBID-CALL,
HERE IS MY ADVICE.


---



STOP

WHEN YOU SEND FIVE TEXTS AND YOU GET NONE BACK

SO YOU WANT TO SEND A SIXTH ONE


---


STOP.

YOU GOTTA STOP.



---


STOP

WHEN YOU'RE FAILING MATH 'CAUSE YOU THINK


---


IT'S MORE ATTRACTIVE TO GUYS IF YOU'RE STUPID

STOP.



---


DO BETTER AND STOP.

I KNOW IT'S HARD, BUT TRY


---


DON'T INSTANTLY GRATIFY

MY GOD, GIRL HE'S JUST A GUY.


---


YOU REALLY NEED TO STOP.



---


STOP

YOU'RE GONNA MAKE A MESS

AND THEN WHO'S GOING TO GET THE MOP?


---

## JANIS:
This guy!


---

## DAMIAN:
WHEN YOU TALK AND YOU TALK 'TIL YOU CAN'T GET CALM,
IT KEEPS COMING OUT LIKE...WORD VOMIT


---


STOP.

EAT A CRACKER AND STOP.


---

## JANIS:
Cady, we all make bad choices, sometimes. Damian, tell her about Phillip.


---

## DAMIAN:
AT ARTS CAMP, I PLAYED LUMIERE

AND THE BEAST AND I HAD A FLING.


---


I'D RUN MY FINGERS THROUGH HIS HAIR

WELL, BEAST SO: FUR


---



HIS SECOND SHOW WAS "ANYTHING GOES"
AND HIS CO-STAR WAS SOME FEMALE THING.


---


AND WHEN THEY KISSED-

## AARON:
Hi. I like your costume—I mean your dress.


---

## CADY:
Thanks!


---

## AARON:
Your room is cool. Is this you riding an elephant?


---

## CADY:
Oh my God. It’s so embarrassing.


---

## AARON:
No it’s not. It’s awesome.


---

## CADY:
Sit down. I’m drinking “not soda” tonight.


---

## AARON:
Yeah, I can tell. We should go downstairs.


---

## CADY:
No, sit down! I’m amazing!


---

## AARON:
Thanks for inviting me tonight. I’ve wasted too much time being pissed at Regina.



---

## CADY:
Yeah, you really have.


---

## AARON:
Um, I’ve been meaning to ask you. I read that the Maasai—in Kenya—

---

## CADY:
Yeah.


---

## AARON:
I read that the Maasai don’t celebrate birthdays. They just become adults when they feel
ready.

---

## CADY:
That’s true. Why did you read that?


---

## AARON:
I was just... interested in Kenya for some reason. Do you miss it?




---

## CADY:
No. I mean. I miss... walking on ground that isn’t pavement all day. 

---

You have to pay attention more and it makes you feel awake. 

---

My mom and I used to play a game where we’d close our eyes and name all the birds we could hear. 

---

We don’t do that
now. Obvs.



---


I WAS ALONE A LOT. MOSTLY OBSERVING THINGS

LIKE HYENAS AND MIGRATIONS AND WHO CARES?


---


NOW I HAVE ALL THESE FRIENDS.

I’M NEVER BY MYSELF.


---


I MEAN, LOOK AT ALL THOSE PEOPLE DOWNSTAIRS.


---

## AARON:
Uh huh.


---

## CADY:
MORE IS ALWAYS BETTER.

MORE PEOPLE KNOW MY NAME.

I HAVE MORE SHOES.


---


MORE IS ALWAYS BETTER.

‘CAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE LESS

YOU HAVE MORE TO LOSE.


---


Wait. That’s confusing.


---

## AARON:
SEE, I DON’T MIND ALONE.


---


SOMETIMES ALONE IS GOOD

‘CAUSE TIME TO THINK IS IN SHORT SUPPLY.



---

## CADY:
YOU HAVEN’T BEEN ALONE.

TRY KENYA WITH ONE PHONE.


---


ALMOST NO PEOPLE.

JUST, LIKE, ANIMALS AND SKY.



---

## CADY:
YOU KNOW WHAT I HAD MORE OF?

STARS.


---


SO MANY STARS AT NIGHT.

BUT HERE THERE’S SO MUCH LIGHT,

---


I SEE THEM LESS NOW.


---

## ENSEMBLE:
HOO-WAH, HOO-WAH,
HOO-WAH, HOO-WAH,
HMM...



---

## CADY:
PLUS, I’M ALWAYS COLD

BECAUSE THE AIR CONDITIONED AIR,

---


THOUGH, IN FAIRNESS,
THAT COULD BE HOW I DRESS NOW.


---


WHATEVER. I LOOK CUTER.

IT WORKED.

LIKE PRETENDING I NEEDED A TUTOR.


---

## AARON:
Pretending?


---

## CADY:
Yeah. You’re gonna laugh. 

---

I pretended to be bad at math to get you to talk to me. 

---

I’m actually really good at math. But now I’m failing.


---

## AARON:
That’s stupid. Why didn’t you just talk to me?


---

## CADY:
Because of Regina. Because you were her property.


---

## AARON:
Her property?


---

## CADY:
No. Shut up. Not property.


---

## AARON:
Don’t tell me to shut up.


---

## CADY:
Oh my god, you’re being so ridiculous right now! Sit down and be hot!


---

## AARON:
You’re like a clone of Regina.


---

## CADY:
What? No!


---


I AM—
MORE. AND I AM BETTER.


---


AND NO ONE LIKES YOU MORE, NOT ANYONE. NOT HER.

MORE IS ALWAYS BETTER. DON’T LOOK AT ME THAT WAY.


---


WHAT GIRL WOULD YOU PREFER?


---

## AARON:
I WOULD PREFER THE GIRL YOU WERE.

NOT WHO YOU’RE TRY’N TO BE.


---


YOU THINK THIS WORKS WITH ME?

WELL YOU THOUGHT WRONG.


---


LOOKING AT THIS PLACE

I SEE YOU TRYING TO ERASE


---


WHAT IS BEST ABOUT YOURSELF,
JUST TO BELONG.


---

## CADY:
Aaron, I—

---

## AARON:
YOU SAY “MORE IS ALWAYS BETTER.”
BUT THERE IS LESS OF YOU THAN THERE WAS BEFORE.


---


SO IF “MORE IS ALWAYS BETTER”...

THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT THROUGH A BIT MORE.


---

## CADY:
I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT THROUGH A BIT

YOU KNOW WHAT I HAD MORE OF?

STARS.


---

## ENSEMBLE:
HMM…

---

## KAREN:
What are you doing?! Aaron is leaving!


---

## CADY:
Aaron wait!


---

## GRETCHEN:
Also someone not me barfed in your oven. Okay, fun. See you tomorrow.



---

## KAREN:
Is this room moving?


---

## CADY:
Aaron, wait! Oh God.


---

## JANIS:
You dirty little liar.


---

## CADY:
Janis, I can explain.


---

## JANIS:
Explain how you’re supposed to be out of town, but sixty different people are posting pictures of your party?


---

## CADY:
You know I couldn’t invite you, I have to act like I don’t know you!


---

## JANIS:
You are full of lies!


---

## DAMIAN:
Janis, I cannot stop this jazzy, you know I have a curfew.


---

## JANIS:
This is your house. You could have invited whoever you wanted. 

---

You could have changed the way the world works and you decided not to.


---

## CADY:
You would hate this party—

---

## JANIS:
Why? Aren’t you having an amazing time with your amazing friends?!



---

## CADY:
Janis, I can’t spend every minute with you. 

---

It’s not my fault that you’re like, in love with me or something.


---

## JANIS:
What?!


---

## DAMIAN:
Oh no she did not.


---

## JANIS:
See that’s the thing with you Plastics. 

---

You think everybody is in love with you, when actually, everybody hates you.


---

## CADY:
You made me like this! It was your idea for me to pretend to be Plastic!


---

## JANIS:
BUDDY, IT’S NOT PRETEND.

YOU ARE AS PLASTIC AS THEY COME.


---


YOU THINK YOUR SHIT DON’T STINK  alt: ”You think your crap don’t stink” 
YOU THINK THE REST OF US ARE DUMB.


---


I HATE REGINA’S GUTS

BUT HERE’S WHAT YOU DON’T COMPREHEND.


---


AT LEAST SHE HAS THE GUTS

TO NOT PRETEND TO BE MY FRIEND!


---


Here, you can have this. It won a prize.

Is this true? Rachel Hamilton fills her inhaler with vodka? Is that—does that work?


---


Ms. Norbury is a “sad old drug pusher”?


---


What does this say? Caitlyn Caussin has what?


---

## REGINA:
“Hairy nips.” 

---

## MS. DUVALL:
Good lord. Well, don’t worry. We’re gonna find out who did this.


---

## REGINA:
There’s only three girls in the whole school who aren’t in it.


---

## MS. DUVALL:
Can you give me names?

## MS. DUVALL:
Ms. Heron, have you ever seen this book before?


---

## CADY:
No. I mean, yes. I’ve seen it before but it’s not mine.


---

## GRETCHEN:
It’s Regina’s. She’s trying to make it look like we wrote it, but really she wrote it.


---

## MS. DUVALL:
Ms. Wieners, why would Regina write, “Aaron Samuels has a fake address”? 

---

Isn’t he her boyfriend or something?


---

## CADY:
It says that? I don’t remember—

---

## MS. DUVALL:
And why would Regina refer to herself as a ”shady chunked-out fugly cow”? 
Ms. Smith, this is no laughing matter.


---

## MS. NORBURY:
Rick, help! I tried to break up a fight and one of ‘em... stabbed me in the leg... with either an Epipen... or one of those pens that has five colors. Either way, my heart is racing.


---

## MS. DUVALL:
Oh, hell no! I did not leave the Southside for this.

But I’m not gonna do that, ‘cause we’ve already paid the deejay.

But I am taking this Burn Book very seriously. 

---

And we are not leaving here until you all are... nice to each other
again. I don’t care how long it takes. 

---

I will keep you here all night.


---

## MS. NORBURY:
We’re not allowed to keep them past four.


---

## MS. DUVALL:
I will keep you here ‘til four! Now who has something to say about this?



---

## CAITLYN C.:
Someone wrote in that book that I’m lying about being a virgin because I use super jumbo
tampons. 

---

But I can’t help it if I have a heavy flow!


---

## MS. DUVALL:
Okay yeah, Ms. Norbury? I need you to run this.


---

## MS. NORBURY:
I don’t want to talk to these jerks. They broke my glasses!


---

## MS. DUVALL:
I need to be able to tell parents we fixed this. 

---

And frankly you need to prove that whoever
called you a “drug pusher” was just joking.

---

## MS. NORBURY:
Okay, hotshots, who wrote all this junk? Cady, any ideas?


---

## CADY:
No.


---

## MS. NORBURY:
Interesting.


---

## REGINA:
Can I just say, I don’t think we have a clique problem at this school. 

---

All this happened because of a few bad people. 

---

And some of us shouldn’t have to participate in whatever
this is, because some of us are just victims in this situation.

---

## MS. NORBURY:
That’s a good point. Let’s get into that. 

---

Umm, everyone close your eyes.



---

Okay, uh, raise your hand if you’ve ever had a girl say something bad about you behind your back.



---

Open your eyes. 

---

Now close your eyes again and this time, raise your hand if you’ve ever talked about a friend behind her back.



---


Open your eyes. How ‘bout that. 

---

Maybe we should take a quick break from being “victims in this situation” and take responsibility for our own actions.



---

Everybody take a piece of paper. Line up over here. Let’s go. 

---

We’re going to write out some apologies to people we’ve hurt in our lives.

‘Cause one thing I know for sure, guys, is that calling someone ugly doesn’t make you better looking. 

---

Calling someone stupid won’t make you any smarter. 

---

And we have to stop beating each other up over every little thing. We as females, have to be able to trust and support each other. 

---

Like this.

Good. That was good. 

---

That could have really backfired. 
Your turn.


---

## SOPHIE K.:
Alyssa, I’m sorry I called you a gap-toothed bitch. 

---

It’s not your fault you’re so gap-toothed.


---


## RACHEL H.:

---


Morgan, I don’t hate you because you’re fat. You’re fat because I hate you.


---

## KAREN:
Gretchen, I’m sorry I laughed at you that time you got diarrhea on the Ferris wheel. 

---

AndI’m sorry for 	repeating it now.



---

And I’m sorry for the people who were below us.


---

## TEARY GIRL:
I just wish we could all get along like we used to in elementary school. 

---

I wish that I could bake a cake made out of rainbows and smiles, and we could all eat it and be happy—

---

## DAMIAN:
She doesn’t even go here!


---

## MS. NORBURY:
Do you even go to this school?



---

## TEARY GIRL:
I’m here for a track meet, but I have a lot of feelings.


---

## MS. NORBURY:
Okay, go home, sweetheart.


---

## REGINA:
Oh my God, it’s her dream come true. Diving into a big pile of girls.


---

## JANIS:
Okay, sure. I have an apology. 

---

So, I have this friend who is a new student this year, and I convinced her that it’d be fun to mess up Regina George’s life. 

---

So we gave her these candy bar things to make her gain weight. 

---

And we turned her best friends against her. Oh and then Cady—you know my friend Cady? She got Regina’s boyfriend to dump her. 

---

But then my friend Cady turned out to be just as phony and selfish as Regina George.



---

So my apology is to myself. 

---

‘Cause I should have known better.


---



SO YOUR BEST FRIEND SCREWED YOU OVER,
ACTED NICE WHEN SHE NOT NICE,

---


WELL, I HAVE SOME ADVICE,
‘CAUSE IT HAPPENED TO ME. TWICE.


---


HERE’S MY SECRET STRATEGY.

IT ALWAYS WORKS BECAUSE THE WORLD DOESN’T END.


---


IT JUST FEELS LIKE IT DOES. JUST RAISE YOUR RIGHT FINGER.



---


AND SOLEMNLY SWEAR.

“WHATEVER THEY SAY ABOUT ME, I DON’T CARE!”

---


I WON’T TWIST IN KNOTS

TO JOIN YOUR GAME,

---


I WILL SAY “YOU MAKE ME MAD.”
AND IF YOU TREAT ME BAD, I’LL SAY YOU’RE BAD.


---


AND IF I EAT ALONE FROM THIS MOMENT ON

THEN THAT’S JUST WHAT I’LL DO

‘CAUSE I’D RATHER BE ME, I’D RATHER BE ME,

---


I’D RATHER BE ME THAN BE WITH YOU.



---


WE’RE SUPPOSED TO ALL BE LADIES,
AND BE NURTURING AND CARE.


---


AND IS IT REALLY FAIR?

BOYS GET TO FIGHT,
WE HAVE TO SHARE.


---


HERE’S THE WAY THAT THAT TURNS OUT,
WE ALWAYS UNDERSTAND.


---


HOW TO SLAP SOMEONE DOWN WITH OUR UNDERHAND.

SO HERE’S MY RIGHT FINGER



---


TO “HOW GIRLS SHOULD BEHAVE.”
‘CAUSE SOMETIMES WHAT’S MEANT TO BREAK


---


YOU MAKES YOU BRAVE.



---


SO I WILL NOT ACT ALL INNOCENT. I WON’T FAKE APOLOGIZE.

LET’S FIGHT AND THEN MAKE UP, NOT TELL THESE LIES.


---


CALL OUR DAMAGE EVEN.

CLEAN THE SLATE ‘TIL IT’S LIKE NEW.


---


IT’S A NEW LIFE FOR ME.

WHERE I’D RATHER BE ME,
I’D RATHER BE ME THAN BE WITH YOU.



---

## JANIS:
I’LL SAY “NO!”
I’LL SAY, “KNOCK IT OFF, WITH YOUR NOTES


---


AND YOUR RULES AND YOUR GAMES.”
AND THOSE SYCOPHANTS WHO FOLLOW YOU


---


I’LL REMEMBER ALL THEIR NAMES.

AND WHEN THEY DRAG YOU DOWN


---


LIKE THEY INEVITABLY DO,
I WILL NOT LAUGH ALONG WITH THEM


---


AND APPROVE THEIR PALACE COUP,
‘CAUSE THAT’S NOT ME.



---

## CADY:
Regina, wait!


---

## JANIS:
I DON’T NEED THEIR GOOD OPINIONS,

---


I HAVE PLENTY OF OPINIONS

EV’RY ASSHOLE HAS OPINIONS,

---


ALT: Everybody has opinions
BUT IT DOESN’T MAKE THEM TRUE,

---


WHAT’S TRUE IS BEING ME,
I’D RATHER BE ME,

---


I’D RATHER BE ME THAN BE WITH YOU!


SO RAISE ‘EM HIGH,


---


‘CAUSE PLAYING NICE AND SHY

IS INSULTING MY IQ.


---


I’D RATHER BE ME, I’D RATHER BE ME

I’D RATHER BE ME,
THAN BE WITH YOU!


---


I’D RATHER BE ME, I’D RATHER BE ME,
I’D RATHER BE ME,

---

## ENSEMBLE:
NO!



---



JAN-IS! JAN-IS!

JAN-IS! JAN-IS!



---


JAN-IS! JAN-IS!



---





JAN-IS! JAN-IS!

JAN-IS! JAN-IS!


---


JAN-IS! JAN-IS!

JAN-IS! JAN-IS!



---


I’D RATHER BE ME,
I’D RATHER BE ME THAN BE WITH YOU!



---


YEAH!


YEAH!

YEAH, YEAH! YEAH!


---


I’D RATHER BE ME, I’D RATHER BE ME,
I’D RATHER BE ME,


---


I’D RATHER BE ME,I’D RATHER BE ME,
I’D RATHER BE ME,



---

## JANIS:
THAN BE WITH YOU!


---

## CADY:
Regina, wait—

---

## ENSEMBLE:
JAN-IS! JAN-IS!




---

## REGINA:

You know what they say about you? 

---

They say 
you are a homeschooled jungle freak who’s a 
less hot version of me.


---

## CADY:
I never meant to hurt-


---

## REGINA:
So you can take your fake apology, roll it up, and shove it up your asshole.




---

## JANIS &  ENSEMBLE:
I’D RATHER BE ME, I’D RATHER BE ME 
I’D RATHER BE ME THAN BE WITH YOU!


---


I’D RATHER BE ME,



---


I’D RATHER BE ME 



---


I’D RATHER BE ME THAN BE WITH YOU!






---

## JANIS:
And that’s how Regina George died.


---

## DAMIAN:
Once again, no one died! 

---

I mean, technically Regina did die for, like, fifteen seconds but then she was revived. 

---

And of course social media started going insane.



---

## LIZZIE T.:
I hear she jumped in front of the bus.


---


## RACHEL H.:
I hear Cady Heron pushed her.


---

## CADY:
This is not my fault! Regina was a terrible person. 

---

We all thought so! I’m the good one in this story. 

---

Janis made me spy on her, and Gretchen wanted me to get rid of her. 

---

Not get
rid of her, just— It’s not my fault she got hit by a bus!



---


FEARLESS

IS NOT A WORD I’D USE FOR ME NOW,

---


IF I WERE FEARLESS, I’DA MADE BETTER DECISIONS,

---


BUT FEARLESS

MAY BE THE ONE THING I CAN BE NOW.


---


NO FRIENDS. NOTHING TO LOSE.

FIND MY WAY BACK AND TRULY CHOOSE TO BE—


---


I wrote it. I wrote that Ms. Norbury is a drug pusher, and it’s a lie.


---

## MS. DUVALL:
Three weeks suspension. And you’re banned from Spring Fling.



---

## CADY:
I WILL TRY TO BE FEARLESS.



---

## COACH CARR:
Now a lot of yins may have questions about all the violence that happened the other day. 

---

Well here’s what no one’s gonna tell ya. Girls are made deranged by what’s called hormones. 

---

Hormones. 

---

W.H.O.R.—

---

## TYLER K.:
I’m voting for Regina George for Spring Fling, ‘cause she got hit by that bus.



---

## JASON W.:
I’m voting for Cady Heron because she pushed her.


---

## KAREN:
Dear Cady, angry cat emoji. Poop emoji. Scream face emoji! Send.


---

## CADY:
Hey. R U mad at me?


---

## KAREN:
Not mad anymore. Thank you for letting me vent. 

---

I like to express myself through emojis because I’m stupid.


---

## CADY:
You’re not stupid, Karen.


---

## KAREN:
No, I am! I’m failing everything—Sometimes I think the only thing I understand is the “Rule of Twos.”


---

## CADY:
The “Rule of Twos”? Is that a math thing?


---

## KAREN:
Haha, bikini emoji, no! 

---

The “Rule of Twos” is how everything is really two things. 

---

Like how you were tricking us but you also still had fun with us. 

---

And how when Regina was
mean to me, it’s because she was unhappy with herself. 

---

And how when Coach Carr tells me he has an “open marriage,” that his wife probably doesn’t know that they do.


---

## CADY:
That’s really smart, Karen.


---

## KAREN:
And how getting suspended actually made it easier ‘cause you could just hide from everybody. 

---

And when you come back tomorrow it’s gonna be so much worse! 

---

So I’ll still be your friend.


---

## CADY:
Thanks, Karen.


---

## KAREN:
Caucasian thumbs up!



---

## MS. NORBURY:
Oh, hi. Did you wanna buy some drugs?


---

## CADY:
No. I’m just done with my quiz.


---

## MS. NORBURY:
I’ll grade it right now.


---

## CADY:
Um, where’s Aaron?


---

## MS. NORBURY:
Oh. He’s not here anymore. Turns out he did live out of district. He’ll have to graduate as a home-schooler.


---


You know, when the police tore apart my house looking for imaginary heroin, I found this old calculator I thought I had lost. 

---

So, totally worth it.


---

## CADY:
I’m really sorry.


---

## MS. NORBURY:
Thank you. 
One hundred. 

---

Welcome back, nerd.


---

## CADY:
Thanks.



---

## MS. NORBURY:
So you’re banned from Spring Fling, huh?


---

## CADY:
Yeah.


---

## MS. NORBURY:
Perfect. ‘Cause I just figured out a way for you to earn some extra credit.


---

## KEVIN G.:
Yo yo, Mathletes State Championship 2019, what. 

---

First female ever on the team, what. A box lunch will be provided, what. Let’s do this.


---

## CADY:
I haven’t thought about math in months.


---

## KEVIN G.:
Africa, “one hundreds” don’t lie! Don’t fight it. You got mad schquillz.


---

## CADY:
Schquillz?


---

## KEVIN G.:
It’s a cool new way of saying “skills.”

---

## MARTIN J.:
Kev, stop trying to make “schquillz” happen. It’s not gonna happen.


---

## KEVIN G :
K.D. you tried the fast life, embrace the math life.


---

## MARTIN J.:
That’s a forced rhyme.


---

## KEVIN G.:
Martin, get off my dick. 
Africa, we need you. Can you do it?


---

## CADY:
I CAN DO THIS. ALWAYS COULD.

AND NOT PLAYING DUMB WILL FEEL SO DAMN GOOD.


---


THE MONSTER INSIDE NEEDS TO BE RELEASED.

GOTTA DO WHAT I DO.


---


GOTTA FEED THE BEAST.


---

## MS. NORBURY:
GOTTA EARN SOME RESPECT. GRAB THAT BIG BRASS RING.


---

## CADY & MS. NORBURY:
LET’S DO THIS THING.


---

## ALL:
LET’S DO THIS THING!


---

## KEVIN G.:
YOU GONNA ROLL UP, STYLIN’, LEATHER ON YA SLEEVE.

ALL STATE CHAMPION, BETTER BELIEVE.


---


MAYBE THE HATERS GONNA MAKE FUN OF YOU

ALL YOU CAN SOLVE’S THE PRO’LEM IN FRONNA YOU!


---


HIGH SCHOOL’S A FOUR-YEAR SOCIAL CURSE

BUT MATH’S THE FOUNDATION OF THE—


---

## KEVIN G. & MATHLETES:
—UNIVERSE,

---

## KEVIN G.:
SO, SICK OF PLUCKING THAT SECOND STRING? THEN LET’S


---

## MATHLETES:
[BEEP]

---

## KEVIN G. & MATHLETES:
DO THIS THING!!


---

## CADY, MS. NORBURY, KEVIN G. & MATHLETES:
DO THIS THING.

DO THIS THING.


---

## CADY:
I’M NO PLASTIC.


---

## MATHLETES:
NO!


---

## CADY:
I’M NO BISH.


---

## MATHLETES:
NO!


---

## CADY & MS. NORBURY:
I’M A LEAN, MEAN, MATH MACHINE ON A MISSION!


---

## CADY:
I LOST WHAT I LOST,
BUT I’LL START BRAND NEW.


---

## CADY & MS. NORBURY:
GO ALL IN FOR THE WIN WITH A CHILL, DOPE CREW.

GOTTA KICK OFF THE DUST.


---

## CADY:
I GOT SCHQUILLZ TO BRING.


---

## KEVIN G., MS.NORBURY & MATHLETES:
SCHQUILLZ!


---

## CADY:
LET’S DO THIS THING.


---

## ALL:
LET’S DO THIS THING!


---

## MATHLETES MODERATOR:
Welcome to the ICMT State final math championships, sponsored by no one.



---


PLEASE SOLVE FOR...



---


## KEVIN G.:
[BUZZ] X EQUALS TWO!


---

## MARYMOUNT 1:
[BUZZ] THE RATE IS TWO PI.


---


## TYLER:
[BUZZ] X IS GREATER THAN THE VALUE OF Y.


---

## MARTIN:
[BUZZ] BOTH POLYNOMIALS ARE SECOND DEGREE, SO THE

ASYMPTOTE IS AT Y EQUALS THREE.



---

## MARYMOUNT 2:
[BUZZ] FUNCTION X EQUALS M X PLUS C.


---

## KEVIN G.:
[BUZZ] THE DERIVATIVE OF F AT ARGUMENT Z.


---

## MARYMOUNT 1:
[BUZZ] [BUZZ] NEGATIVE FOUR.


---

## CADY:
[BUZZ] [BUZZ] NEGATIVE TWO.


---

## MARYMOUNT 3:
[BUZZ] THE SLOPE IS ZERO.


---

## CAROLINE K.:
[BUZZ] THE ANSWER IS TRUE.


---

## MARYMOUNT 1:
[BUZZ] ONE POINT OF INFLECTION.


---

## MARTIN:
[BUZZ] TWENTY-NINE.


---

## CADY:
[BUZZ] FOUR IS THE SLOPE OF THE TANGENT LINE.


---

## MS. NORBURY:
How you feeling?


---

## CADY:
Amazing.


---

## MS. NORBURY:
You got this. Here, take a water.


---

## CADY:
Thank you—
—Aaron! Why?


---

## AARON:
Ms. Norbury asked me to help ‘cause everyone else is at Spring Fling, and since I don’t go to North Shore anymore—

---

## CADY:
Aaron, I didn’t write that stuff-


---

## AARON:
—I know. That was Regina. I forgot who I was dealing with.


---

## CADY:
Well, I’m sorry you have to be home-schooled.


---

## AARON:
Yeah, so’s my mom.


Go get ‘em. I like seeing you be awesome. I haven’t seen it in a long time.


---

## CADY:
Why are you doing this to me?!


---

## MS. NORBURY:
Because I’m a pusher. 

---

And I know if you can be your authentic self in front of Aaron, you’ll be able to do it for the rest of your life.


---

## MATHLETES MODERATOR:
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a tie. 

---

In the event of a tie, we move into a one-on-one sudden death round in which each team may choose their opponent. 

---

Marymount, who do
you select?

---

## MARYMOUNT CAPTAIN:
We pick the girl.


---

## KEVIN G.:
We pick the girl, too.


---

## MATHLETES MODERATOR:
Ms. Krafft and Ms. Heron, please step forward.


---

## CADY:
Nice to meet you—


---

## CAROLINE K.:
You’re going down, slut.



---

## MATHLETES MODERATOR:
Contestants, find the limit of this equation.


---

## CADY:
It’s not me against you. It’s North Shore versus Marymount.



---

And I’m not here to be better than the one other girl.



---

I’m here to be better than all of you.


---

## CAROLINE K.:
The limit is negative one!


---

## CADY:
Shuck. I meant to say shoot and then I almost said—

---

## MATHLETES MODERATOR:
That answer is incorrect. 

---

If Ms. Heron can answer correctly, we have a winner.


---

## CADY:
Why did you waste time insulting me? Why did I waste time judging your hair? This is not a competition!


---

## KEVIN G.:
It kind of is, though.


---

## CADY:
Right, a math one.


---


IF WE BREAK FROM THIS CRAP,
THEN THE ANSWERS LAND IN OUR LAP.


---


DON’T BE SCARED, JUST PERSIST.

THEN OUR LIMIT DOES NOT EXIST.


---


NO, THE LIMIT DOES NOT EXIST!


---

## MATHLETES MODERATOR:
Our new state champions, the North Shore Mathletes!


---

## KEVIN G.:
Aw yeh! You like that, Marymount?



---

## CADY & MS. NORBURY:
‘CAUSE DON’T IT FEEL GOOD TO HAVE GOT

THIS FAR


---


BASED ON SOMETHING YOU DID,
NOT THE GIRL YOU ARE?



---

## CADY & MS. NORBURY:
YOU CAN’T HEAR THE FEAR

OVER YOUR HEART JUST SINGIN’
“JUST DO YOUR THING!”



---

## KEVIN G., AARON & ENSEMBLE:
AAH...


AAH...


---

## KEVIN G., AARON & ENSEMBLE:
AAH...


AAH...



---


## MS. NORBURY, AARON, KEVIN G. & ENSEMBLE:
ALL YOU CAN SOLVE’S THE PRO’LEM IN FRONNA YOU.


---


## CADY, MS. NORBURY, AARON, KEVIN G. & ENSEMBLE:
DO YOUR THING.


---


## MS. NORBURY, AARON, KEVIN G. & ENSEMBLE:
LIVIN’ FOR ME NOT LIVIN’ FOR NONE ‘A YOU.


---

## ALL:
DO. YOUR. THING! DO YOUR THING!



---

## KEVIN G.:
Noice, Mathletes! We made it back in time to hit Spring Fling.


---

## CADY:
I can’t. I’m banned.


---

## MS. NORBURY:
I’ll get you in. Everyone’s afraid of me now, it’s great.

SHE starts to go then turns back to AARON.


---

## AARON:
Have a good time. You deserve it.


---

## CADY:
Um, in case I never see you again.


---

## CADY:
I just wanted to say—

---

## AARON:
Yeah, I just feel like—



---

## AARON:
Sorry, you go first.


---

## MS. NORBURY:
Don’t make me watch this, guys, I’m your teacher... Mathletes, get inside [before I get arrested again.]

---

## CADY:
Regina! You look pretty.


---

## REGINA:
I’m wearing a spinal halo.


---

## CADY:
I’m sorry about the bus. I feel like it’s all my fault.


---

## REGINA:
Stop making this about you. I’m the one who got hit by a bus.


---

## CADY:
Well, I’m sorry about all the other stuff too.


---

## REGINA:
Okay. Yeah. I’m going to forgive you. Because I’m on a lot of pain medication right now. You know I died for fifteen seconds, right? Spoiler alert: heaven looks like a really nice hotel in Miami.


---

## CADY:
That must have been scary.


---

## REGINA:
When I woke up in the street, all I could see was my mom’s face and Gretchen’s big face looking down at me. 

---

And they looked so surprised. 

---

Not even sad, just like, surprised that
I could be bleeding. 

---

Like they forgot I was a human person. 

---

I’ve actually been a human
person this whole time.

---

## CADY:
I know. It’s weird when people treat you like you’re famous or something.


---

## REGINA:
It’s amazing until it’s not. I know I have to change. 

---

I know I was harsh. And people say I’m a bitch. 

---

But you know what they would call me if I was a boy?


---

## CADY:
Strong?


---

## REGINA:
“Reginald.” That’s what my mom was gonna name me if I was a boy, so honestly I’d
rather be “bitch.” 

---

## CADY:
Well I’m sorry if I took your spot in the food chain—

---

## REGINA:

Not your fault. Don’t apologize for things that aren’t your fault. 

---

And never apologize for being a boss. Love ya!


---

## MS. DUVALL:
Okay, do we have all our nominees for Spring Fling King and Queen here on the stage? 

---

I just want to say that you’re all winners and that I could not be happier that this school
year is ending. 

---

The winner of Spring Fling King is...



---

Shane Oman.


---

## SHANE O.:
Whoo! J’yeah!


---

## CADY:
Janis. Can I talk to you?


---

## JANIS:
No. I’m busy right now. My date and I are hooking up.


---

## DAMIAN:
Ew.


---

## CADY:
Janis, please—

---

## MS. DUVALL:
And the winner of Spring Fling Queen is...

Caddy Heron.


---

## CADY:
What?


---

## JANIS:
Unbelievable.


---

## CADY:
Wow. Um, I think people voted for me ‘cause they think I pushed someone in front of a bus. 

---

Which is terrible.


---

## REGINA:
Not your fault! Don’t apologize!


---

## CADY:
No, I won’t. But what is my fault is the way I treated my friend Janis. 

---

So I’m sorry. 

---

I lied to you and I left you out, and if we’re not friends anymore, I understand.


---

## MS. DUVALL:
You know it isn’t really required of you to make a speech.


---

## CADY:
Almost done, I promise. When I first moved here, I wanted you all to like me so bad... 

---

I thought I had to change myself to be good enough. 

---

We all do that sometimes, I think. 

---

But Looking at you guys from up here... I wish you could see it. You’re awesome.


---

## MS. DUVALL:
Really. Most people just take the crown and go.


---

## CADY:
CROWN. RIGHT.

HERE, IN THIS LIGHT? IT COULD BE PLATINUM.


---


ACTU’LLY IT’S KIND OF DUMB.


---


We could really just share it.


---


CHEAP. FAKE. EASY TO BREAK.

THAT’S HOW I USED TO BE.


---



HERE. TAKE IT. NOW I’M AWAKE.

I’LL TELL YOU WHAT I SEE:

---


PLASTIC DON’T SHINE, GLITTER DON’T SHINE,
RHINESTONES DON’T SHINE THE WAY YOU DO.


---


YOU ARE SO REAL. YOU ARE SO RARE.

I SEE YOU THERE— I SEE YOU.



---


I SEE STARS.

SO MANY STARS TONIGHT.


---


YOU COULD MAKE DIAMONDS DULL.

YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL.



---


I SEE STARS.

YOU SHINE AS BRIGHT AS DAY.


---


I WILL LOOK OUT FOR YOU.

WE’LL LIGHT EACH OTHER’S WAY.


---


YOU’RE ALL STARS.

SEE, I WENT LOW, NOT HIGH.


---


THAT WAS MY PROBLEM. MINE.

DON’T BE FRIGHTENED LIKE ME THE DARKER THE NIGHT


---


THE BRIGHTER YOU SHINE.


---

## JANIS:
PLASTIC DON’T SHINE,

---

## CADY:
GLITTER DON’T SHINE,


---

## JANIS:
RHINESTONES DON’T SHINE THE WAY YOU DO.


---

## CADY & JANIS:
YOU ARE ON FIRE. YOU CAN RISE HIGH’R.

UP IN THE SKY, ENJOY THE VIEW.


---

## CADY:
YOU STARS

SO MANY STARS TONIGHT


---


YOU COULD MAKE DIAMONDS DULL.

YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL.


---


I SEE STARS.

YOU ARE REAL, AND YOU ARE RARE.


---


I WANT TO SAY, I SEE YOU THERE:
IT’S ME AND YOU NOT US AND HER


---


‘CAUSE IF WE KNEW


---

## CADY, PLASTICS & JANIS:
HOW STRONG WE WERE.


---

## CADY:
WE’D SAY WHAT WE ARE.


---

## PLASTICS, JANIS, DAMIAN, MEN & WOMEN:
STARS!


---

## CADY, PLASTICS & JANIS:
SAY WHAT YOU ARE


---

## MEN:
WE’RE STARS!


---

## WOMEN:
STARS!


---


## CADY, PLASTICS, JANIS, SOPRANOS & DAMIAN:
STARS!


---

## DAMIAN:
And so, freshmen, the moral of our story is thus: Calling someone stupid won’t make you any smarter.


---

## JANIS:
And even the people you don’t like at all, are still people.


---

## DAMIAN & JANIS:
So, get off their dicks.


---

## JASON W.:
Three, two, one, yeah!



---

## ALL:

I SEE STARS.

SO MANY STARS TONIGHT.


---


WE COULD MAKE DIAMONDS DULL.

WE ARE SO BEAUTIFUL.
