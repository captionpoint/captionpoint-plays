## JACK:
June 1, 1942.

---

Dear Miss Rabiner,

---

How do you do?

---

I’m Captain Jacob S. Ludwig, U.S. Army.

---

As you probably know, my father and your father are friends, 

---

and they have suggested that you and I meet and get acquainted in a social way.

---

I am stationed at an army base in Medford, Oregon, 168 miles south of Eugene, Oregon.

---

I understand that you live in New York City.

---

I would not imagine that you get to Medford, Oregon very often, 

---

so perhaps a meeting in New York City would be more convenient for you.

---

Sincerely,

---

Captain Jacob S. Ludwig, U.S. Army.	

---

## LOUISE:
June 4, 1942

---

Dear Captain Ludwig,

---

Thank you for your letter.

---

Does “meet and get acquainted in a social way” mean go out on a date?

---

If so, the answer is yes, I would like that very much.

---

As for where to meet, I agree that New York City would be more convenient.

---

I suppose we could meet halfway, 

---

in Bismarck, North Dakota, but then we’d both need snowshoes.

---

Sincerely,

---

Louise R. Rabiner, Private Citizen

---

PS:  Can you tell me something about yourself?

---

## JACK:
Dear Miss Rabiner,

---

You said you would like to know something about me, 

---

but I don’t know what to write without boring you.

---

My father is a tailor in Coatesville, Pennsylvania.

---

I was born in Coatesville and grew up in Coatesville.

---

Coatesville is even smaller than Medford.

---

That’s all I can think of.

---



Sincerely, 
---
Captain Jacob S. Ludwig, U.S. Army

---

## LOUISE:
Dear Captain Ludwig,

---

You can do better than that.

---

Sincerely, 

---

Louise Rabiner

---

## JACK:
Dear Miss Rabiner,

---

All right, I’ll try.

---

Coatesville has a population of 5,000, 

---

and it’s 25 miles due west of Philadelphia on Route 30.

---

I have only one sibling, a sister named Betty.

---

It is just us two children, which I suppose is a little unusual, 

---

since my mother is one of twelve children, all girls.

---

So I have a lot of aunts.

---

Sincerely,

---

Captain Jacob S. Ludwig, U.S. Army

---

## LOUISE:
Keep going.

---

## JACK:
There is not much more to tell.

---

During high school I worked at a soda fountain after school and during the summers.

---

I enjoyed making root beer floats most of all 

---

because it took a lot of practice to keep the foam from dripping all over my hands 

---

when I added the root beer.

---

My next job was working at the Lukens Steel Mill on the outskirts of Coatesville, 

---

also after school and on weekends.

---

Then I went to college and then medical school.

---

Right after medical school I was drafted.

---

Now you know everything there is to know about me.

---

## LOUISE:
You’re a doctor?

---

## JACK:
Yes.

---

## LOUISE:
And you didn’t tell me?

---

## JACK:
I just told you two letters ago.

---

## LOUISE:
You are either the most modest human being that ever lived or this is a trick.

---

Don’t you know that every girl in the world wants to go out with a doctor?

---

Except me.

---

It’s too obvious.

---

Do you dance?

---

## JACK:
No.

---

## LOUISE:
Why not?

---

## JACK:
No one ever taught me.

---

## LOUISE:
Would you like to learn to dance?

---

## JACK:
No.

---

## LOUISE:
Why not?

---

## JACK:
Because it would make me feel self-conscious.

---

## LOUISE:
Dear Captain Jacob S. Ludwig, U.S. Army,

---

That’s the most ridiculous thing I ever heard.

---
template: noise
radio clicks on; spritely jazz begins
---

Dancing is the one thing in life that can take you out of yourself 

---

and lift you up from the everyday workaday world onto a higher plane.

---

Dancing is also beautiful, artistic and a wonderful way to get to know people.

---

PS:  I’m a dancer.

---

template: noise
music stops

---

PPS:  Can we start using first names now?

---

I like to be called Louise, though my sister calls me Lou.

---

What do you prefer?

---

## JACK:
I like to be called Jack.

---

Sincerely,

---
    
Captain Jacob S. Ludwig, U.S. Army

---

## LOUISE:
Was that a joke?

---

## JACK:
Was what a joke?

---

And I’m sorry for my remarks about dancing.

---

My father told me you were an actress, not a dancer.

---

Can you tell me about yourself?

---

## LOUISE:
Of course.

---

I was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York.

---

I went to the High School for the Performing Arts in Manhattan for which I had to audition,

---

and I did a song from Anything Goes by Cole Porter.

---

I sang “Blow Gabriel Blow,” which is one of the songs that Ethel Merman sang 

---

in the original production.

---

She’s my idol.

---

Her and Ginger Rogers.

---

And Lauren Bacall.

---

And, if I’m fair, Rosalind Russell, but I don’t like how she dresses.

---

Anyway, I sang “Blow Gabriel Blow” and I went for the high B-flat at the end, 

---

which in my case sounded like a chain saw trying to cut through aluminum, 

---

but that apparently stunned the professors so much 

---

that they marked the wrong box on their evaluation sheets and I still got in.

---

After high school I went to NYU for two semesters 

---

but dropped out to become a dancer and actress.

---

Now I'm living in the theater district at the Curtain Call boarding house. 

---

And guess what?

---

It’s working!  Earlier this year I was in my first professional show ever.

---

I played a woman who was…how shall I put this…a lady of the night.

---

It was terrific and everybody said I was very convincing.

---
template: noise
silence

---

Dear Jack,

---

I take it from your long silence 

---

that you don’t approve of my playing a lady of the night.

---

But I think it’s important that the theater isn’t afraid to talk about anything 

---

that it considers honest and important.

---

And it was The Threepenny Opera by Bertolt Brecht, who is a well-known writer.

---

template: noise
silence

---

Okay, it was nice knowing you.

---

Have a nice life.

---

template: noise
Silence

---

Bye.

---

template: noise
Silence

---

## JACK:
Dear Louise,

---

I’m so sorry for not writing.

---

There was an emergency and they needed doctors to go out to sea 

---

and treat the incoming wounded from a battle in the Pacific.

---

I was on the ship for several days, but that’s all I’m allowed to say about it.

---

So I’m very sorry.

---

I received your letters but I wasn’t allowed to write to anyone.

---

You must have thought I was extremely rude.

---

So last heard from, you were playing an unusual part in a play.

---

That must have been challenging.

---

## LOUISE:
Dear Jack,

---

What a terrible war.

---

I’m sorry you had to be out on emergency and I feel awful for being mad about it.

---

Of course, you didn’t know I was mad.

---

## JACK:
Yes I did.

---

I could tell when you wrote “Bye.”

---

Can you please continue telling me about yourself?

---

If that’s all right?

---

## LOUISE:
Of course it’s all right.

---

I guess I tried to shock you by saying lady of the night.

---

The truth is, The Threepenny Opera isn’t shocking at all.

---

It’s a modern  version of a musical from the 18th century, 

---

and it’s meant to be very avant garde.

---

That just means the stage was dark and we all spoke with Hungarian accents.

---

It was presented in a church basement with about 40 seats, 

---

and it only ran for two weeks, so it was not exactly a Broadway debut.

---

## JACK:
Dear Louise,

---

I think that’s wonderful.

---

Everyone has to start somewhere, and to get any role in any play in New York City 
---

sounds like a big accomplishment to me.

---

Have you tried out for other parts, too?

---

## LOUISE:
Yes, I audition all the time, mostly for musicals, 

---

but for some of them you need experience just to get in the door.

---

I also take dancing and singing lessons every week, 

---

both with the same woman and she’s tremendous.

---

She screams with life.

---

(Sometimes she screams, at me, too, 

---

but only when I do something dumb like strain my vocal cords)

---

As I guess you can tell, my goal in life is to be on Broadway.

---

That usually means starting out in the chorus line, 

---

which would be fine with me, in fact, I’d love it.

---

Last week I saw Oklahoma and it was so wonderful I almost fainted.

---

Really.

---

At one point, a character named Ado Annie, who was played by an actress named Celeste Holm, 

---

sang a song called  “I’m Just A Girl Who Can’t Say No,” 

---

and I literally held my breath for so long I got dizzy.

---

I didn’t know I was holding my breath, it’s just that the song was so perfect 

---

and the performance so stunning that I couldn’t move.

---

Do you ever feel that way about anything?

---

Sometimes I want to be in a show so badly that I want to cry about it.

---

I shouldn’t have told you that.

---

Now you’ll think I’m crazy.

---

## JACK:
You don’t sound crazy at all, you sound passionate.

---

I don’t feel as passionate as that about anything.

---

I wish I did.

---

I feel angry about the war, but that’s not the same.

---

When I was in college, I thought about becoming an architect 

---

and I even took a course in it.

---

There’s something very precise about architecture that I like very much.

---

But I also like working as a doctor.

---

It makes me feel that I’m accomplishing something specific and useful.

---

I also like getting to know my patients.

---

Some of them are so wounded, they can’t communicate at first.

---

But as they get better, they start talking about their lives and their families, 

---

and I can see the anxiety simply lifting out of them.

---

Their faces become less troubled and they start looking hopeful again.

---

It doesn’t always happen, of course.

---

Some of them just don’t get better.

---

Sorry.

---

That was the longest paragraph I’ve ever written.

---

Except once when I wrote a three-page letter to my father, 

---

right after high school, telling him that I didn’t want to follow in his footsteps.

---

He read it quietly, handed it back to me and said,

---

(with a Yiddish accent) “You want to become a doctor instead of a tailor

---

and you think I’m going to be mad at you?”

---

"Your mother is in there dancing in the kitchen!"

---

## LOUISE:
Ha!

---

## JACK:
On a more practical note, I’ve been looking into getting a plane to New York.

---

It shouldn’t be too hard because my base is part of the Army Air Force Training Command, 

---

and we have a whole airport right here on the other side of the hospital.

---

The hard part will be getting leave.

---

I figure I’ll need at least a 4-day pass to get to New York, meet you and get back.

---

The trouble is that leave is only granted to one doctor at a time, 

---

and apparently it can take as long as six months to get any kind of a pass at all.

---

On top of that, my commanding officer, Colonel Ramsey, 

---

is very hard-nosed and inflexible.

---

Those aren’t the words we use about him here on the base, 

---

but I don’t want to shock you.

---

For the word “nose” in the phrase “hard-nosed,” 

---

you have to substitute another word which stands for a different part of the body, 

---

the part you sit down on.

---

It starts with the letter “a.”  

---

All best,	

---

Jack

---

template: noise
Silence

---

Hello?

---

Are you there?

---

template: noise
Silence

---

Oh my God, now you’re offended.

---

I’m so sorry!  I shouldn’t have tried to be funny.

---

I can see now how offensive it was.

---

“The a-word.”…Louise?

---

## LOUISE:
No, no, no, I’m not offended at all, are you crazy?

---

Dancers are very physical beings and we use the “a” word constantly.

---

Besides, I grew up in Brooklyn, 

---
and calling people the a-word is the nicest thing we said about anybody.

---

But guess what, guess what?!  

---

I’ve got an audition for an actual Broadway play!  

---

It’s a long story, but a friend of mine knows somebody who knows a producer 

---
and I got a call last week and they want to see me this Friday!  

---

So I’m very sorry that I didn’t write for a few days, but I’ve been buried in the part 

---

because I have about 40 lines I have to memorize 

---
and I want to be letter perfect and I’m still working on them.

---

My roommate is drilling them with me every night.

---

Her name is Cynthia Monroe and she’s the most gorgeous creature you’ve ever seen, 

---
as well as the nicest.

---

She holds down two jobs, one as a receptionist, the other as a waitress, 

---

and she still wants to be in show business.

---

You watch.

---

She’ll be a big star some day and she’ll still have every friend she ever met.

---

More soon, I promise,

---

Sincerely,

---

Louise-in-a-state-of-terror-Rabiner

---

## JACK:
What’s the play?

---

## LOUISE:
It’s a comedy called _Arsenic and Old Lace_.

---

It has been playing on Broadway for ages, 

---

and they're on their third replacement cast, I'm up for Elaine,

---

who is one of the leads, 

---

and it’s a wonderful part.

---

In the story, Elaine is engaged to Moritmer Brewster. 

---

In the movie, he's going to be played by Cary Grant.

---

He thinks that his family is crazy…which they are! 

---

Oh, I wish you could hear me deliver the lines out loud, 

---

but I can write them out so you can see them.

---

Plus, that’ll help me memorize them.

---

Okay?

---

Here goes.

---



Wait!  I should also mention that at this point of the play 
---
Elaine has just run out of the cellar, 

---

where she's locked up by Mortimer's brother, who is a criminal. 
---
## LOUISE: (as Elaine)
template: noise
gasping
---
Mortimer, where have you been? I've almost been killed! What's going on in this house?


---


What do you mean, what's going on in this house?
---
## LOUISE: (as Elaine)
You were supposed to take me to the theater tonight, and you called it off.
---
You asked me to marry you, I said I would, and five minutes later you thew me out! 
---
Now listen, Mr. Brewster, I want to know where I stand!
---
Do you love me?
---
## LOUISE: (as Mortimer)
I love you very much, Elaine. In fact, I love you so much I _cannot_ marry you. 
---
## LOUISE: (as Elaine)
Have you suddenly gone crazy? 
---
## LOUISE: (as Mortimer)
I don't think so, but it's only a matter of time. 
---
You see, insanity runs in my family. It practically gallops. 
---
## LOUISE: (as Elaine)
Listen, Mortimer, you'll have to do better than that! 
---
## LOUISE: (as Mortimer)
No, dear, there is a strange taint in the Brewster blood. If you really knew my family, 
---
it's what you'd expect if Strindberg wrote the Ziegfield Follies. 
---
## LOUISE: (as Elaine)
Now darling, none of this proves that you're crazy! 
---
Look at your Aunts…they're Brewsters, aren't they? 
---
And they're the sanest people I have ever known!
---
## LOUISE: (as Mortimer)
Look Elaine, I know I'm acting irrationally, but remember: 
---
I'm a Mad Brewster!!
---
## LOUISE: (as Elaine)
Listen, Mister! If you think that you can get out of this by pretending that you're insane…
---
you're crazy!! If you're not going to marry me, 
---
I’m going to marry you, you dope!!
---

## LOUISE: (as herself)
That’s it.

---

What do you think?

---

Elaine's whole part is terrific, but that’s the passage I’m doing for the audition.

---

## JACK:
Wow.

---

I wish I could hear you reciting the lines.

---

When I come East and you’re in it, will you get me a ticket?

---

## LOUISE:
Ha ha.

---

The audition is on Friday, and I don’t think I’ve ever been this nervous.

---

## JACK:
Good luck.

---

I’ll be thinking about you on the big day.

---

template: noise
Silence

---

Louise?

---

template: noise
Silence

---

Louise, how did it go?

---

template: noise
Silence

---

Louise?

---

## LOUISE:
Hell's Bells I'm so angry!!

---

I’ll never swear again, but Goddamnit to Hell, I am so angry!  

---

Okay, here’s what happened.

---

On Friday, I walked into the audition and behind the table, 

---

are the producers Howard Lindsay and Russell Crouse, 

---

two of the biggest names in the American theater.

---

I’m not kidding, they wrote _Life With Father_.

---

Anyway, they asked me to read, so I took a breath and did the part…and I was incredible!  

---

I don’t know why, but I was like an airplane, soaring through the sky and they loved it!  

---

They even said so!  

---
And then they said they had another actress to see that day 

---

and would I mind coming back the next day to do it again.

---

So I went home, came back on Thursday, nailed it again,  

---

and they said wait outside, this’ll just take a minute.

---

Then they called me back in and said, “Listen, we both thought you did a wonderful job 

---

but we’ve decided to go with the other actress.

---

Her name is Cynthia Monroe.”  

---

CYNTHIA MONROE!  That’s my roommate, the little no-good weasel!  

---

She never told me she was up for the part,   

---

and now she says she didn’t tell me because she thought it would make me nervous, 

---

which is a big lie because she probably didn’t know about the play until she rehearsed it with me   

---

and then I’ll bet she snuck around to the theater and got an audition  

---

 and now she’s going to star in a Broadway show 

---

while I starve for the rest of my life in a garret 

---

like that girl with the CANDLE IN THE ITALIAN OPERA!

---

## JACK:
You seem upset.

---

## LOUISE:
I am upset!  And I hereby give up acting.

---

I’m going back to tap dancing.

---

You can rely on a good pair of tap shoes.

---

And please don’t feel sorry for me.

---

Just think of me kindly when you read about my funeral after I kill myself,   

---

so how are you?

---

## JACK:
I think I’m better than you are at the moment.

---

## LOUISE:
You got that right.

---
template: noise
Christmas-y string music

---

## JACK:
December 14, 1942

---

Dear Louise,

---

Happy holidays.

---

I have some bad news.

---

Colonel Ramsey still hasn’t granted my request for leave,   

---

and now I think it won’t happen till January.

---

I know that a 4-day pass doesn’t sound like much,   

---

but if you could see the state of our patients, you’d see the problem.

---

Severe burns, missing limbs.

---

But these kids are fighters and they don’t give up.

---

How will you be spending the holidays?

---

## LOUISE:
Dear Jack,

---

I think I’ll take my usual very religious attitude and go on a pilgrimage to Macy's.

---

Does the hospital put up lights or anything?

---

## JACK:
They do put up lights, and we also have a Christmas tree and a menorah in the visiting area.

---

I understand that last year there was a party on Christmas eve   

---

and they tried to get everybody out of their beds to dance.

---

Yes, dance, and I suppose I’ll try it in the spirit of fellowship.

---

Meanwhile, somebody put mistletoe up over the doorway to the surgical area,   

---

and as I walked through the door after an operation yesterday,   

---

one of the nurses kissed me on the cheek.

---

I tell you this because in the Army we believe in full disclosure.

---

## LOUISE:
What’s her name?

---

I’ll scratch her eyes out.

---

## JACK:
Her name is Annie and she’s about 80 years old.

---

## LOUISE:
I’ll still scratch her eyes out.

---

In show business we believe not only in full disclosure,   

---

but also revenge.

---

How are you holding up?

---

## JACK:
I’ll be fine, thank you for asking.

---

It’s the patients I’m worried about.

---

Most of them are teenagers, for God’s sake.

---

I still can’t believe there is a war.

---

My father says “the human race is no damn good,”   

---

and I’m inclined to agree with him.

---

Did you read Eleanor Roosevelt’s column last week?

---

She said “I wonder that the time does not come when young men facing each other with intent to kill  

---

 do not suddenly think of their homes and their loved ones, 

---

and realizing that those on the other side must have the same thoughts,   

---

throw away their weapons of murder.”

---

I’m sure I’ll write again before the end of the month,   

---

but in case something happens, I just want to wish you a happy holiday.

---

You’ve made the past few months very…enjoyable for me.

---

## LOUISE:
Happy holidays to you, Jack.

January 15, 1943

---

Dear Jack,

---

Yesterday, the most incredible thing happened.

---

I met your parents!    

---

I went to see my parents in Brooklyn to pick up a skirt I needed for an audition, 

---

and I walked in the door and suddenly my parents introduced me to your parents   

---

who were there for dinner!  I couldn’t believe it!  

---

My father acted very nonchalant and said,   

---

“Hey, Lou, do you remember that boy I said you should meet some time?

---

The one in the Army?

---

Well these are his parents.

---

They just dropped by.”

---

Ha.

---

I didn’t believe that for a minute.

---

Nobody just drops by for dinner all dressed up,   

---

at least not in Brooklyn unless they’re Italian.

---

So I’ll bet there’s some conniving going on.


---

And they were drinking wine, which I find completely suspicious because my parents only drink Manechevitz.

---

Anyway, your parents are wonderful.

---

I love the way your father has a kind of quiet sense of humor.

---

And your mother is the sweetest woman who ever lived.

---

She kept patting me on the arm and smiling.

---

So I patted her back and she made happy little gurgling noises.

---

She said template: noise
using his mother’s Yiddish accent “You vould like my son.

---

He is very fine boy.

---

He’s a doctor and he is in ze Army, and now that we’ve met   

---

and I know you are such a fine girl, I hope you vill visit us some time in Coatesville.

---

Have you heard of Coatesville?”

---

template: noise
her own voice So I told her that Coatesville had a population of 5,000   

---

and was 25 miles due west of Philadelphia on Route 30.

---

That surprised her.

---

But she took it in stride and kept patting my arm.

---

I’m telling you, she’s adorable.

---

She’s out of a Norman Rockwell painting if Norman Rockwell ever painted Jews.

---

I also met your sister Betty who was there, and she’s so…attractive and interesting.

---

She took me aside at one point and whispered,  

---

“I know my parents are trying to fix you up with my brother,   

---

but you’re not his type, he’s so intelligent.”

---

So what’s the story?

---

Have you told your parents yet that we write to each other?

---

That would explain the family Cabinet Meeting I stumbled into.

---

## JACK:
Dear Louise,

---

No, I’ve never told my parents about our letters,   

---

but I think Betty found out and she may have told them.

---

There’s a GI on my base who’s from a town near Coatesville and he dated her once  

---

and I guess I bragged about you a couple of times at the hospital.

---

I’m sorry about that.

---

## LOUISE:
What are you sorry about?

---

It means you like me.

---

## JACK:
I guess it does.

---

## LOUISE:
February 10, 1943

---

Any word yet from Colonel Ramshackle about your leave of absence?

---

## JACK:
No, not yet, but I submit the paperwork at least once a week.

---

## LOUISE:
Paperwork?

---

Are you kidding?

---

Just put your finger in his eye and say “Rammy, old boy, I want that approval   

---

and I want it now or I’m putting my scalpel down and calling the Pentagon!”

---

## JACK:
That sounds like it would work out beautifully.

---

## LOUISE:
Holy Hannah and call the Marines.

---

Have I got news for you.

---

Are you ready?

---

Your mother has just invited me to visit her   

---

in Coatesville two weeks from Sunday.

---

Coatesville!  Land of Legend!    

---

I’ve got the letter right here.

---

She says she thinks I’d enjoy getting out of the city for a day.

---

She also says that coincidentally some of her sisters   

---

will be visiting that day from Philadelphia and I might enjoy meeting them.

---

So what do you think?

---

I’d like to go, but it will do exactly what we’ve been trying to avoid—  

---

put pressure on our relationship.

---

Of course you might say what relationship,   

---

since we’ve never met each other.

---

Hint, hint.

---

So what should I do?

---

Go to Coatesville or not?

---

## JACK:
No.

---

Definitely not.

---

Too many things could go wrong and it makes me nervous.

---

## LOUISE:
Me, too.

---

I agree entirely.

---

On the other hand, it might be rude to turn them down.

---

I mean, what’s the worst that could happen?

---

## JACK:
You have no idea.

---

Just tell them you’re busy that day.

---

## LOUISE:
Will do.

---

But what if they suggest another day?

---

## JACK:
I have no idea.

---

## LOUISE:
“You have no idea?!”  They’re your parents and I need some advice.

---

You’re the only man I’ve ever written a thousand letters to   

---

and it’s pretty hard to keep lying to them   

---

but that’s what I’ll do if it’s what you want me to do,   

---

now what I should do?!

---

## JACK:
Don’t go.

---

I’d rather take you there myself if I ever get home,   

---

and if you go without me it could be a disaster,   

---

so the answer is clear as a bell:  DO NOT GO!

---

## LOUISE:
FINE!

---
---

Dear Mrs. Ludwig,

---

Yes of course I’ll come.

---

Sincerely, 

---

Louise Rabiner

---

## JACK:
You said yes?!

---

## LOUISE:
Yes, and don’t bug me about it.

---

I think it’s the right thing to do.

---

## JACK:
Then why did you ask me?

---

## LOUISE:
To get your advice.

---

## JACK:
And I said don’t do it!

---

## LOUISE:
You were indecisive.

---

## JACK:
“Indecisive?”  I said no, don’t go, how is that indecisive?

---

## LOUISE:
It was the way you said it.

---

## JACK:
It was a letter!

---

## LOUISE:
Oh great.

---

Now I’m worried.

---

I only wish you were going with me,   

---

but that presumes we’ve actually met in person 

---

and God forbid the God damn Army should give you a God damn 4-day pass   

---

for once in their God damn lives.

---

Excuse the language, but it makes me so mad some times!    

---

Don’t they have other doctors in that place?!  

---

Can’t you tell Colonel Ramsblossom or whatever he’s called   

---

that I caught malaria and have a week to live  

---

 and this is the only chance you’ll ever have to say hello to me.

---

God damn it!

---

Sorry.

---

I think I’m getting nervous about going.

---

## JACK:
Listen.

---

You shouldn’t be nervous.

---

Actually, I think you’ll have a good time.

---

My aunts will be especially warm and welcoming.

---

Dear Aunt Florence,

---

Listen to me very carefully.

---

Do not, I repeat do not give Louise a cooking test   

---

like you did with the last woman I showed an interest in.

---

Do you remember Marjory?

---

She left me the day after meeting the aunts.

---

She told me you took her into the kitchen,   

---

forced her to make sweet and sour cabbage rolls and said,   

---

“Darling, if you plan to feed these to my nephew, 

---

I suggest you drown yourself right now and get it over with.”  

---

Then Aunt Sue criticized her lipstick,   

---

Aunt Linda told her her dress didn’t fit but she knew a good seamstress who works miracles, 

---

and Aunt Brenda said her chest looked phony,   

---

quote “but I mean that in the nicest way possible” end quote.

---

Then Aunt Lena criticized her teeth, Aunt Bert gave her the name of a hairdresser,   

---

and Aunt Evelyn asked her if she had scoliosis.

---

So rest assured, Aunt Florence, that I will know if you do these things—  

---

I guarantee you, I will find out—  

---

and if Louise comes back with a single story of any kind, 

---

I’ll tell my mother what you said about Dad last summer and she will never speak to you again!    

---

Now go tell your sisters to check their mail boxes   

---

because I’m writing to every single one of them, good bye!

---

Dear Louise,

---

I just heard from Aunt Florence and she’s looking forward to meeting you.

---

So have a good time in Coatesville.

---

I’m sure it will be a relaxing day all around.

---

template: noise

---

Well, what happened?

---

template: noise
Silence

---

Louise?

---

template: noise
Silence

---

Hello?

---

template: noise
Silence

---

Would you please tell me what happened?!

---

## LOUISE:
Dear Jack,

---

Well, I just got home and I have to tell you,   

---

your family is everything it’s cracked up to be and  you don’t deserve them.

---

To start from the beginning, I arrived in Coatesville on the 11:07   

---

and your father and mother were waiting on the platform for me—  

---

along with your mother’s eleven sisters and all their husbands.

---

That made 25 of us, but some of them also brought their children,   

---

so I think the total was about 40.

---

When we left the station, everyone got in their cars and drove to your house,   

---

and the people of Coatesville must have thought it was either a parade or a funeral.

---

There were people lining the streets on either side, waving.

---

What the heck did you tell these people?

---

That I was the Queen of England?

---

That, or your family is desperate to get rid of you.

---

What am I missing here?

---

It’s not as if you’re bad to look at.

---

I know that now because your mother showed me about a hundred photographs of you.

---

I saw you as a baby, as a toddler, as a schoolboy,   

---

as a high school graduate, as a college graduate and as a med school graduate.

---

I also saw you in the bathtub when you were one year old—  

---

and believe me, I saw all of you.

---

I think you’ll also be glad to hear that your aunts were on their best  behavior,   

---

except Aunt Linda who asked me why I had dark circles under my eyes.

---

I told her I was a fan dancer and it kept me up late at night and that shut her up.

---

Your sister Betty was the most interesting of all,   

---

and that leads me to why I didn’t write you for a couple of days.

---

I ended up staying over at your house for two nights to recover.

---

Here’s what happened:
  

---


Towards the end of the day, your aunts started to get in their cars,   

---

and that was perfect because I had to catch the train to New York.

---

Then Betty chimed in and said “Please don’t go yet, I want to show you my room first.”  

---

I thought that was sweet, so we went upstairs.

---

I saw her room and she showed me pictures of her boyfriends,   

---

and then she suggested I go to the window and look at the view.

---

As you know, it’s a large window, it was wide open, and I fell out.

---

Yes, that’s right, I went out the window.

---

One minute I was standing there looking at the trees,   

---

enjoying the air blowing in from the front yard,   

---

and the next minute Betty must have tripped on something behind me—

---

she says she caught her toe on the rug near the bureau—  

---

and her shoulder hit me in the back and out I went.

---

Fortunately, Betty’s window is over the roof of the porch, so I landed on that, 

---

then slid downward and bounced off the gutter which broke my fall,   

---

so when I landed in the bushes I didn’t break anything.

---

Betty, of course, let out a shriek, and everyone came running and made a fuss,   

---

but I was fine except for a couple of bruises, which are healing nicely.

---

I felt like an idiot, of course, but I guess these things happen.

---

Your aunts insisted that two of their husbands carry me into the house,   

---

which wasn’t necessary, but they did it anyway.

---

So we had a parade into the living room with Betty at the rear yelling   

---

“It was an accident!  It was an accident!”  

---

They put me on a couch and your Aunt Fern rolled up her sleeves   

---

and told everybody to stand aside, she was trained as a nurse, 

---

but your other aunts shouted her down because apparently she has no training whatsoever.

---

Then she admitted that she’d always wanted to be a nurse but never got around to it.

---

Then one of your uncles pulled out his business card   

---

and said he was a lawyer and that I could sue your parents and make a bundle.

---

Everyone else got mad at him and they all ended up fighting   

---

while I sat there and watched.

---

Then they all went home.

---

Your parents then insisted that I stay the night,   

---

and it ended up being two nights, and they couldn’t do enough for me.

---

I got to taste your mother’s borscht with sour cream on the second night   

---

and I had two helpings.

---

And earlier that day, your mother and I made strudel,   

---

and if I could, that’s all I’d eat for the rest of my life.

---

So even if you and I never meet, I want your parents to adopt me.

---

Who would have guessed it?

---

Louise

---

PS:  Betty says she feels awful about what happened.

---

She said she’ll make it up to me by taking me camping,   

---

but I told her that that was highly unlikely.

---

## JACK:
Dear Louise,

---

Your letter amused and horrified me.

---

Thank God you’re all right.

---

I hope you don’t think that Betty pushed you on purpose 

---

out of some crazy sibling jealousy or something.

---

Let me think that.

---

## LOUISE:
We can think it together.

---

Now what’s the story with Colonel Ramsbottom?

---

Is this guy ever going to give in?

---

## JACK:
He better or my parents will kill him.

---

As soon as you left Coatesville, they wrote me a three-page letter raving about you.

---

As soon as I read it, I marched right in to see Colonel Ramsey 

---

and I reminded him that it was eight months since I requested leave.

---

He could see how angry I was, and he looked me straight in the eye 

---

and said he’d think about it.

---

## LOUISE:
“Think about it?”  Holy Hell!  What’s the matter with that man?!  

---

What the hell is he doing, crocheting a hat or something?

---

Please send me his address right away.

---

## JACK:
No.

---

## LOUISE:
Why not?

---

## JACK:
Because I know you, and I’d be court-martialed the next morning.

---

## LOUISE:
Well we have to do something!

---

## JACK:
But I’d be in jail.

---

## LOUISE:
Well at least I could visit you!!!

---

## JACK:
April 21, 1943

---

Dear Louise,

---

Guess what, guess what.

---

Colonel Ramsey just gave in.

---

## LOUISE:
Well Hallelujah!

---

## JACK:
I have no idea why he changed his mind.

---

He called me to his office and he was holding a letter and… Oh my God.

---

You didn’t write to him, did you?

---

No, don’t tell me.

---

I don’t want to know.

---

In any case, I’m getting a four-day pass and I’ll be there to see you on the 17th.

---

What do you think?

---

## LOUISE:
Well let me see.

---

I have to check my calendar.

---

As usual, it’s filled with appointments.

---

Hmm.

---

On the 16th,  it’s chicken and biscuits at the boarding house, 

---

I wouldn’t want to miss that.

---

And on the 17th  the Aga Kahn is taking me to the opera, as he always does.

---

## JACK:
Oh no!  I should have checked the date with you first.

---

I’m so sorry.

---

I’ll talk to the Colonel and see if he can move it back a day.

---

## LOUISE:
Jack, I was kidding!  I don’t even know the Aga Kahn.

---

## JACK:
Oh, good.

---

So then Saturday night is all right with you?

---

## LOUISE:
Yes, it’s fine.

---

It’s more than fine.

---

I’m looking forward to it.

---

## JACK:
Great!


---


So now we have over a month to plan the big event.

---

What would you like to do?

---

Shall we say dinner first, then a Broadway show?

---

Is there anything special you want to see?

---

PS:  Could you send me a picture of yourself?

---

PPS:  Only 48 days to go.

---

## LOUISE:
How exciting!  

---

48 days is barely enough time to buy a dress!  

---

I’ll go out tomorrow morning and start looking.

---

As for the evening, I think dinner sounds good.

---

I’m very fond of dinner.

---

And yes, I’d love to go to a show.

---

The one I’d like to see at the moment is a comedy by Noel Coward 

---

called Blithe Spirit about a woman who’s a ghost, 

---

and she drives her husband crazy when she visits him from the Great Beyond.

---

If I die young, that’s exactly what I want to do.

---

Just think what fun it would be, walking through walls 

---

and watching your husband kiss another woman.

---

Incidentally, I walk by their box office all the time, 

---

so I’m happy to pick up the tickets.

---

In fact, the tickets can be my contribution to the evening.

---

Okay, here comes the hard part:  I’d love to go dancing after the show.

---

I know you said you didn’t want to learn, but can I change your mind?

---

Dancing is easy.

---

Honestly.

---

It’s just walking with rhythm.

---

No practice necessary.

---

Louise


---


PS:  Enclosed is the picture of me you asked for, though I’m hesitant to send it.

---

It’s just a snapshot that my sister took.

---

Please glance at it briefly while wearing sunglasses, then destroy it.

---

## JACK:
Dear Louise,

---

I’m speechless. You’re so beautiful.

---

I don’t know what to say.

---

## LOUISE:
Please keep talking.

---

## JACK:
Are you a model?

---

Is that really you?

---

I had no idea.

---

If I ever introduced you to any of my friends, they’d die of jealousy.

---

## LOUISE:
Dear Jack,

---

That was the sweetest letter I ever received,

---

and if I looked like you say I do, I wouldn’t have to do auditions, 

---

I’d just sign contracts.

---

Now about the dancing:  Is it yes or no?

---

## JACK:
Yes… 

---


but I’ve got to warn you:  The last woman I danced with is still on crutches.

---
template: noise
music plays softly
---

## LOUISE:
Aha.

---

So you have danced with other women.

---

How many?

---

## JACK:
No comment.

---

## LOUISE:
Were they all beautiful?

---

## JACK:
Still no comment.

---

## LOUISE:
Only 33 days to go.

---

## JACK:
How’s show biz?

---

## LOUISE:
As crazy as ever.

---

I have an audition tomorrow for the USO.

---

Ha! Wouldn’t that be a kick in the pants.

---

Do you know that Hollywood has raised over fifty million dollars to support the war effort?

---

And over half of that has been raised by only two stars, 

---

Betty Grable and Rita Hayworth, 

---

who made it by selling kisses at charity events.

---

Holy Hannah!  My lips would hurt!

---

## JACK:
They’d do more than hurt.

---

As a medical matter, repetitive kissing has two disadvantages.

---

First, it can spread disease, which is particularly dangerous during wartime.

---

Second, if your lips get too dry, they can crack and get infected.

---

## LOUISE:
You mean you wouldn’t buy a kiss from Betty Grable?

---

## JACK:
No, of course not.

---

It would be far too dangerous.

---

Heddy Lamar, possibly, but in moderation.

---

## LOUISE:
You’re a fraud.

---

## JACK:
I know, but it was a trick question.

---

## LOUISE:
Wait!  I just had a terrible thought.

---

What if we meet and don’t get along?

---

## JACK:
Then I’ll introduce you to Colonel Ramsey.

---

## LOUISE:
Send me a picture.

---

## JACK:
Of Colonel Ramsey?

---

## LOUISE:
Nine more days.

---

## JACK:
Six more days.

---

## LOUISE:
Three more days.

This is she.

Oh my God.

---

This is Jack.

“Jack” Jack?

Jack Ludwig.

## LOUISE:
You’re kidding.

Hi.

---

## JACK:
Hi.

---

You sound just like I thought you’d sound.

---

## LOUISE:
So do you.

---

Is something the matter?

---

## JACK:
Yes.

---

We need to postpone our date.

---

I’m sorry.

---

## LOUISE:
Are you all right?!

---

## JACK:
Yes, but there’s been a major battle in the Pacific.

---

You’ll read about it in tomorrow’s papers.

---

There are so many casualties, they’re being ferried to Guam, then ending up here and it’s a madhouse.

---

All leave is cancelled for at least two weeks.

---

I’m so sorry.

---

## LOUISE:
Don’t be ridiculous.

---

It’s not your fault.

---

## JACK:
I know.

---

It’s just…it’s horrible.

---

## LOUISE:
Will you be all right?

---

## JACK:
Yeah.

---

## LOUISE:
…Keep your chin up.

---

## JACK:
You too.

---

…Also…

---

## LOUISE:
What?

---

## JACK:
I’ll tell you later.

---

## LOUISE:
Tell me now.

---

## JACK:
There’s…there’s talk about being sent overseas.

---

## LOUISE:
Oh no.

---

## JACK:
There’s nothing definite yet.

---

## LOUISE:
Good.

---

I’m glad.

---

## JACK:
It’s bound to come.

---

## LOUISE:
Not necessarily!

---

## JACK:
…So what about the tickets?

---

## LOUISE:
What tickets?

---

## JACK:
To the play you arranged.

---

Can you exchange them?

---

## LOUISE:
Easily.

---

## JACK:
I mean we’ll still have our date.

---

It may take a while, that’s all.

---

## LOUISE:
Of course.

---

Where are we going for dinner?

---

## JACK:
That’s a surprise.

---

## LOUISE:
Deal.

---

## JACK:
Deal.

---

## LOUISE:
August 1, 1943

---

Dear Jack,

---

Are you all right?

---

I haven’t heard from you for over four weeks and of course I’m concerned.

---

If you can, just let me know you’re okay.

---

template: noise
Silence

---

## JACK:
Dear Louise,

---

I’m sorry it’s taken me so long to get back to you.

---

The casualties were non-stop, and once again, I was taken out to a ship—

---

But I’m back in place now, and back to normal, whatever that is.

---

## LOUISE:
Dear Jack,

---

I’m not sure that anything is normal any more.

---

I keep reading about the battles and the casualties, 

---

and I just can’t figure out what happened.

---

Meanwhile, the life of a starving actress goes on as usual.

---

My father tells a joke about a golfer who’s playing a round with his friend Elmer, 

---

but Elmer has a heart attack on the second green and dies.

---

That night, the guy gets home and tells his wife about it and she says, 

---

“Oh my gosh, that’s horrible, what did you do?!”  

---

And he says, “Yeah, it was awful.

---

After that it was just ‘Hit the ball, drag Elmer. Hit the ball, drag Elmer.’”  

---

Well, my life these days feels exactly the same:  

---

“Wake up in the morning, sing for a producer. Wake up in the morning, sing for a producer.”  

---

And so far, there’s been nary a bite.

---

In other news, I heard that Cynthia Monroe left _Arsenic and Old Lace_ last week.

---

It turns out she was—how can I put this delicately?

---

– ripe with child.

---


The truth is, I wish her well.

---

We had a lot of good times together.

---
There was one time we were at a cocktail party given by a producer

---

And there was a punch bowl. And we thought we were drinking fruit punch.

---

Turned out it was _filled with gin_. 

---

And we ended up literally removing our…

---

Any news on your front?

---

Good news, of course.

---

Or anything at all, for that matter.

---

As I think you know, I love hearing from you.

---

All affection,

---

Louise

---

## JACK:
Dear Louise,

---

I’d love to send you some good news for a change, but in fact I have something difficult to relate.

---

I just received my orders to go overseas.

---

I can’t say I didn’t see it coming, but it’s still a shock.

---

I just wrote and told my mother and dad, and that was the worst part of the whole thing.

---

You know them now, and you know that they won’t take it very well.

---

For what it’s worth, some of the other doctors here 

---

have received similar orders and a number of us are going over together.

---

We’ll be responsible for establishing an evacuation hospital near the line of battle.

---

You would think that they’d send us to the Pacific 

---

since we’re already here on the West Coast, but the Army, 

---

in its wisdom, is sending us in the other direction.

---

There’s been talk in the papers lately about opening up a second front in Europe, 

---

either in France or Belgium, and I have a feeling we’re going to be part of it.

---

However, there is a kind of silver lining:  

---

they’re giving each of us a 5-day leave before we ship out.

---

I’ll be going to Coatesville, of course, to see Mom and Dad, 

---

but then I’d like to come to New York and see you.

---

The day  will be Saturday, October 9th.

---

What do you think?

---

Are you still game?

---

## LOUISE:
“Am I still game?”  Yes, Jack, I’m still game.

---

Are you crazy?

---

If I could, I’d be at the airport to meet the plane.

---

But for God’s sake!  What’s the matter with these people?

---

Why can’t they all just get along?

---

And why can’t the Army just leave you here?

---

Hell’s bells!  Don’t they need doctors here in the states??!!  

---

S-word, S-word, S-word, A-word, S-word.

---

## JACK:
Do you always swear when you’re angry?

---

## LOUISE:
Yes.

---

K-word!

---

## JACK:
K-word?

---

## LOUISE:
Krap!

---

## JACK:
You know not everyone gets killed when they go overseas.

---

## LOUISE:
I didn’t say that and I wasn’t implying it.

---

Have you always been an idiot, or do you just practice?

---

## JACK:
I practice.

---

Now what about our date?

---

It better be good.

---

According to you, it could be the last time you’ll ever see me.

---

## LOUISE:
You know that’s really, really not funny.

---

## JACK:
Sorry.

---

Around here they call it gallows humor, and there’s a lot of it.

---

## LOUISE:
Well tell them for me they’re all idiots.

---

## JACK:
Will do.

---

So what about our date?

---

Same drill?

---

Dinner, show, and dare I say it, a little dancing?

---

## LOUISE:
Yes.

---

And you better practice because I plan to dance your feet off.

---

Also, the play I chose is still running, so I sure as heck hope you like it.

---

## JACK:
Of course I’ll like it, I’ll be seeing it with you.

---

## LOUISE:
Well that was slick.

---

Clearly the Army is having a bad influence on you.

---

## JACK:
So what about show business?

---

Any auditions coming up?

---

## LOUISE:
Yes, as a matter of fact.

---

A big one.

---

Have you heard of a musical called Hellzapoppin’?

---

It’s been playing on Broadway for years, 

---

and now they’re sending a road company all over the country.

---

I’m up for one of the best roles, and guess who the producers are?

---

Howard Lindsay and Russell Crouse!  

---

They’re the ones who liked my audition for Arsenic and Old Lace 

---

but chose Cynthia “the Ripper” Monroe instead.

---

But the request to audition came straight from them, 

---

so I might have an honest-to-god shot this time.

---

Now the question is, what songs to prepare.

---

Dammit, I wish you were here so I could try out a couple of numbers on you.

---

For the slow number, my short list includes I’ll Never Smile Again, 

---

It Had To Be You and White Christmas.

---

For the up number it’s between Chattanooga Choo Choo, For Me and My Gal 

---

and Jeepers Creepers.

---

So what do I choose?!  Hell’s bells!  The audition is in two days and I wish you were here.

---

I need a cheering section!

---

Love,

---

Louise

## JACK:
 “Love?”

## JACK:
Dear Louise,

---

How did it go?

---

template: noise
Silence

---

Hello?

---

Are you there?

---


Hey, I’m the one who’s supposed to be hard to reach.

---

What happened?!

---

## LOUISE:
Dear Jack,

---

Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, OH MY GOD!  I GOT THE PART!!  

---

I’M IN A BROADWAY MUSICAL!!!  

---

Okay, it’s the road company of a Broadway musical, 

---

but it’s a Broadway musical!  Thank you so much for the telegram.


---

I used both your suggestions and they worked like a charm.

---

It took me three auditions to get the part, which is why I didn’t write right away.

---

Meanwhile I have only one thing to say:  Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, OH MY GOD!  

---

## JACK:
Congratulations!  I told everybody at my table last night at dinner 

---

and we drank a toast to your Broadway debut.

---

## LOUISE:
Thank you so much.

---

I don’t know how I suddenly got so lucky.

---

It’s a real double-whammy.

---

I get to be in a Broadway show, and I get to see you on the…

---

Wait a second.

---

Oh no.

---

This could interfere with our date!  Holy Hannah.

---

I’m not exactly sure when I leave, but I get the typed-up schedule on Monday 

---

and I’ll write to you immediately.

---
---

Dear Jack,

---

I just got the schedule, and I don’t know what to do.

---

Beginning October 3rd we start crisscrossing the country to do the show.

---

On October 9th, our date night, we’ll be finishing up a week in Cincinnati, 

---

then we head straight to Cleveland for a week, then south to Charlotte and Nashville, 

---

and on it goes.

---

I signed on for 20 weeks to begin with, 

---

and it’s renewable after that for another 20 if both parties agree.

---

What should I do?

---

I can try to break the contract.

---

Or is there any way you can get to Cincinnati on October 9th?

---

I’m crushed and I’m sorry and I don’t know what to do.

---

Love,	Louise

---

## JACK:
Dear Louise,

---

Don’t be silly.

---

Of course you shouldn’t break the contract.

---

It’s nice of you to offer but it’s out of the question.

---

This is your dream-come-true, and you certainly can’t spoil it for one lousy date.

---

Or perhaps one very excellent date, who knows what would have happened.

---

But this really is the chance of a lifetime and you should enjoy every second of it.

---

I don’t know if you’ve noticed from our letters, 

---

but I’m not much of a reader or an intellectual.

---

Beginning in high school, for a lot of reasons, 

---

I felt that I should become a doctor and I focused on the sciences.

---

Having said that, I read a book about five years ago that really stuck with me, 

---

called My Early Life by Winston Churchill.

---

I should backtrack a minute and say that Churchill is my greatest hero  

---

aside from my parents.

---

One of the things that has impressed me most about him is his personal courage.

---

In the Boer War, he rode his horse into battle fearlessly,

---

 without complaint and with a sense of duty.

---

He was just like the boys I take care of these days.

---

They’re aware of the danger, but they know what they have to do 

---

and why they’re doing it and just keep going.

---

Recently, however, I learned something new.

---

Two months ago Churchill flew to Malta to meet with his officers and ground troops, 

---

and the trip took over 20 hours in a B-24 

---

that was filled with cargo and had only 4 seats in the hull.

---

He was accompanied by his physician, Lord Moran, and two of his advisors, 

---

and they ended up dodging enemy planes, 

---

flying through terrible weather that made the wings shake and lose some fittings, 

---

it was twenty degrees inside the hull and they had to sit on wooden benches.

---

Meanwhile, the noise of the engines was so intense that they couldn’t hear each other, 

---

even when shouting.

---

And here’s the thing:  this was the Prime Minister of England, 

---

who didn’t have to leave his office for a single instant if he didn’t want to, 

---

and no one would have thought one wit less of him.

---

He did it out of a sense of duty to support the kids who were out there dying for their country, 

---

and I find this level of personal courage phenomenal.

---

Anyway, the reason I mention Churchill is because what you’re going through—

---

and why you must do the tour and live the life you’ve dreamed about—

---

reminds me of a passage in the Churchill book.

---

He says I passed out of Sandhurst into the world.

---

It opened like Aladdin’s Cave.

---

When I look back upon the years when I was twenty to twenty-five years old, 

---

all the days were good and each day better than the other.

---

Ups and downs, risks and journeys, but always the sense of motion, 

---

and the illusion of hope.

---

Come now all you young men and women all over the world.

---

You are needed more than ever now.

---

You have not an hour to lose.

---

You will make all kinds of mistakes, that is certain; 

---

but as long as you are generous and true, and also fierce, you cannot hurt the world.

---

She was made to be wooed and won by youth.

---

Forgive me for being so bombastic, it’s not like me.

---

One of the reasons I love Churchill so much is that I’ve always been shy by nature—

---

I guess you can tell—and I wish I had Churchill’s courage and thrust.

---

But I know that now is the time for you to thrust ahead on all that talent, 

---

and we’ll figure out the rest of it, I promise.

---

Love, Jack

---

## LOUISE:
I’m leaving the show and flying to Medford.

---

## JACK:
No you’re not.

---

## LOUISE:
Why not?

---

## JACK:
I told you why not.

---

How are rehearsals?

---

## LOUISE:
Rehearsals are wonderful, if you must know.

---

Everybody is so talented that I feel like a fool.

---

Did you ever look into flying to Cincinnati?

---

## JACK:
I did look into it and it’s impossible.

---

What’s your itinerary after that in case my departure gets delayed for some reason?

---

## LOUISE:
From Cincinnati we do one week each in Cleveland, Charlotte, Nashville, Atlanta, 

---

Des Moines, Orlando, Miami, Columbus, Chicago, Roanoke and Philadelphia.

---

Oops, wait a second, at the end we also hit Springfield, Huntsville and Richmond 

---

because we do some split weeks.

---

But it doesn’t really matter because by the end I’ll probably be on crutches.

---

When do you leave Medford?

---

## JACK:
We leave tomorrow.

---

We’re being sent to Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio 

---

where apparently they prepare us for conditions in Europe.

---

That should be interesting.

## LOUISE:
October 2, 1943

---

Dear Jack,

---

We arrived in Cincinnati yesterday and we moved into the theater this morning.

---

The sets are lavish, the costumes are glamorous, 

---

and I’m so terrified I keep throwing up.

---

Did you get to Fort Sam Houston yet?

---

## JACK:
Yes, I’m here, and it’s quite a change from the base at Medford.

---

The doctors live in barracks and tents, and I drew the short straw 

---

and I’m in a tent.

---

Actually, it’s not so terrible.

---

It’s about 8 feet square and it doesn’t hold much but my  locker and a cot, 

---

but do you want to hear something funny?

---

I kind of like the simplicity of it.

---

What I don’t like is all the drilling.

---

Yesterday we did a ten-mile hike with full packs, 

---

and then we had to run an obstacle course under barbed wire.

---

To top it all off, at the end of the day, 

---

we learned how to take a bath in our helmet liners.

---

Yes, that’s what I said.

---

And I think I just spoiled any sense of romance you ever had about me.

---

## LOUISE:
Your helmet liner?

---

## JACK:
Don’t ask.

---

## LOUISE:
Right.

---

## JACK:
How did the opening go?

---

I can’t wait to hear.

---

## LOUISE:
The opening?

---

Oh that little thing?

---

Well, I have to admit, it was hands-down, the most thrilling night of my entire life.

---

The audience clapped and shouted and I could hardly breathe.

---

Did I tell you I get a solo bow?

---

I do, right after the other principals and before the chorus.

---

My nightmare has been that the light would hit me 

---

and the place would suddenly go dead silent, but it didn’t happen.

---

They kept on cheering and I burst into tears.

---

## JACK:
I hate to say I told you so, but I told you so.

---

## LOUISE:
Oh shut up.

---

## JACK:
Are there any pictures of you in the show that you can send me?

---

I’d love to see you in costume to sort of hold me over till I can see the real thing .

---

On the other hand, seeing you in costume might remind me of all the adoring men 

---

who must come to your dressing room night after night, bringing you flowers.

---

Does that really happen?

---

## LOUISE:
Now and then, but I can assure you, we’re so tired by the end of the show, 

---

it doesn’t make the least bit of difference.

---

template: noise
Silence

---

Jack?

---

template: noise
Silence

---

## JACK:
Sorry, sorry, I couldn’t write.

---

This time it was a 2-week training exercise in the middle of nowhere, 

---

teaching us about chemical warfare and how to move an entire hospital while under fire.

---

For God’s sake, can’t they just end this God-damn war?!  

---

Sorry, I just…it’s all so horrible.

---

And here’s the thing:  I got my  marching orders this morning, 

---

and I leave for Europe at the end of the week.

---



The only good news is that I’ll get to see my parents, 

---

since we head out through the port of New York.

---

Please address all future letters to the 121st Station Hospital, U.S. Army, Europe.

---

## LOUISE:
Will do.

---

Please say hello to your parents for me.

---

And Betty.

---

It shows what a war can do to a person.

---

I actually think with fondness of the day she pushed me out the window.

---

Now listen to me and listen carefully.

---

I’m only going to say this once.

---

Jack, take very, very good care of yourself.

---

Don’t ever do anything foolish or  try to be heroic.

---

What you’re doing already is heroic, and any extra heroism isn’t needed or desirable.

---

All right?

---

Are we clear about this?

---

How’s that for bossy?

---

My parents say it’s my worst trait.

---

But seriously, will you promise me to take care of yourself?

---

Let me add that knowing what you’re about to do makes me very proud to be your…what?

---

Chief Correspondent?

---

Fellow Scribbler?

---

Biggest fan?

---

Whatever the hell I am, I’m proud of you.

---

Got it?

---

## JACK:
Got it.

---

Thanks.

To Captain Jacob S Ludwig

---


121st Station Hospital, U.S. Army, Europe

---

Dear Jack,

---

Happy Halloween from Nashville, Tennessee.

---

Somehow, the witches and goblins around here aren’t very scary with their southern accents.

---

## JACK:
Happy Thanksgiving from a village in England, 

---

where they don’t eat turkey and never heard of Thanksgiving.

---

## LOUISE:
Happy New Year from Loo’ville, Kentucky.

---

The shopping here is a little limited, 

---

but I’m sending you a box of food that I understand is scarce in the Army.

---

## JACK:
Bagels?

---

Where did you find bagels in Kentucky?

---

Thank you so much.

---

## LOUISE:
My pleasure.

---

I tried to send you some lox to go with it, 

---

but it started to smell by the time I got it to the post office.

---

So I left it on the counter and pretended it wasn't mine. 

---

## LOUISE:
Where are you living?

---

Do you live in barracks?

---

## JACK:
Not at the moment.

---

A lot of us are living in villages with families that have a spare room to offer.

---

The families are all so grateful that the Americans  entered the war 

---

that they’d give us the shirts off their backs if we needed them.

---

I can’t tell you where I am, of course, but the countryside is gorgeous, 

---

with hedgerows that make the landscape into a sort of quilt-like pattern.

---

But the German air raids happen every few days, and there are parts of our  village 

---

that are nothing but rubble.

---



Listen, I have a favor to ask.

---

My best friend at the base in Medford was a doctor named Greg Baird.

---

He’s an absolutely terrific guy.

---

He did his residency in pediatrics, then, like me, 

---

he was drafted and ended up in the Army.

---

God knows why, but he wasn’t sent abroad.

---

He’s still in Medford, but now he has a week’s leave 

---

and he’s going to be in Kansas City the same week your tour is there.

---

He’s single, and I wonder if any of your friends in the show would like to go out with him.

---

He’s also very good looking, so don’t even think of going out with him yourself.

---

## LOUISE:
Ha ha.

---

As if I had time for a social life.

---

We do eight shows a week, Tuesday through Sunday, with two matinees, 

---

and I know Dominican nuns who have more fun than we do.

---

Meanwhile, I have a date lined up for your friend Greg.

---

Her name’s Patsy and she’s in the chorus.

---

She’s petite, gorgeous, and I guarantee by the end of the night, 

---

he’ll be the happiest pediatrician in the State of Kansas.

---

## JACK:
March 1, 1944

---

Dear Jack,

---

Hello, you old piece of tripe.

---

It’s Greg from Medford.

---

How’s the Doc?

---

Where the hell are you?

---

We’ve missed you at the base, and we often lift a glass to you and everyone else who shipped out for the front.

---

Meanwhile, I’ve got to thank you.

---

I arrived here in Kansas City yesterday morning, 

---

and last night I had one of the best dates I ever had in my life.

---

The woman you set me up with is terrific and I hope to see her again this week while I’m in town.

---

But more importantly I have to tell you about Louise.

---

She’s outstanding.

---

She’s beautiful, smart, talented, and if you ever let her slip through your fingers, you’re an idiot.

---

Well you are an idiot, but you’d be a bigger idiot.

---

She seems to think you’re the bee’s knees, and while I don’t know what gave her that impression, she’s got it.

---

Also, if I were you, I’d get back here stateside as soon as possible 

---

because it’s clear to me that every guy here wants to jump her bones.

---

I saw the show last night  and she took me backstage afterwards 

---

and one guy was actually drooling, I swear to God.

---

He kept drying his chin with a handkerchief.

---

Hey, don’t get me wrong.

---

I don’t think she cares about any of them, 

---

but these guys don’t know that and they all want to sleep with her.

---

Take care, buddy.

---

Greg

---

Dear Greg,

---

Thanks a lot.

---

I wasn’t upset enough about being 3,000 miles from home, now I won’t sleep at night.

---

## LOUISE:
Dear Jack,

---

Well, I met your friend Greg yesterday, and I have to say, he’s quite a guy.

---

You were totally right about him, he’s sweet and funny, 

---

and my friend Patsy is crazy about him.

---



He came backstage right after the show, and he made a hit with everybody, 

---

especially the girls, as you can imagine.

---

They all just loved that he takes care of children.

---

And you know what he did?

---

He brought me flowers to thank me for arranging the date with Patsy.

---

What a gentleman.

---

It turns out that he’ll be here for the rest of the week, 

---

and everyone’s hoping to see more of him.

---

In fact, he’s asked me to dinner after the show on Thursday to talk about you.

---

He says it’s the least he can do for the trouble we took.

---

And he says he has lots of stories about you that I’ll want to hear.

---

Now that should be interesting.

---

## JACK:
Dear Louise,

---

Do not believe anything that Greg tells you.

---

He’ll make up stories because he thinks they’re funny, 

---

and you never know when he’s telling the truth.

---

And why on earth is he taking you to dinner?

---

I thought you set him up with Patsy!

---

## LOUISE:
Hey!  Can’t a girl have a decent dinner now and then?

---

I need my strength.

---

## JACK:
Oh, great.

---

## LOUISE:
Dear Jack,

---

Well, Greg took me to dinner last night, and it was very interesting.

---

He told me lots of stories about you that you never told me yourself.

---

He says that all the nurses always made a fuss over you.

---

Is that true?

---

He said that one nurse in particular, named Ginnie something, 

---

had a real crush on you while you were in San Antonio.

---

Did she go abroad with your battalion?

---

He seemed to think so.

---

It must be nice to have company from back home.

---

## JACK:
Yes, Ginnie did come over with us.

---

She’s a lovely young woman who was born and raised near Coatesville, believe it or not.

---

We used to kid that we were neighbors and that we must have gone to the same football games.

---

## LOUISE:
Dear Jack,


---


I had dinner with Greg again, just a few minutes ago.

---

He said there was something he had to tell me.

---

He told me that you and Ginnie were a “couple” in San Antonio.

---

He says that…that Ginnie used to…spend the night sometimes in your tent, 

---

or at least till quite late, and that you and she were an “item” as he calls it.

---

Is any of this true?

---

template: noise
Silence

---

## JACK:
Yes it is.

---

I never told you about it because I thought it might hurt your feelings.

---

Ginnie and I did get close.

---

Then we split up.

---

That’s all I want to say about it.

---

## LOUISE:
Jack, how could you spoil everything?!

---

## JACK:
I was lonely.

---

All of us are lonely every day of this goddam war.

---

## LOUISE:
Why did you split up?

---

## JACK:
Because I told her about you.

---

I told her how I waited for your letters every day and that all I thought about was meeting you.

---

Listen.

---

I know that this whole thing we’re doing is ridiculous.

---

Obviously, we like each other, and I feel as though I’ve known you forever.

---

But we’ve never even met each other.

---

What if we meet and you’re not…attracted to me?

---

What if I’m not as great as all those actors and stars you spend your life with?

---

What if we meet and you take one good look at me and say, 

---

“Wow. He’s really nice, he could be my brother.”  

---

Or what if you don’t even like me at all?

---

What if we don’t get along?!  We don’t know anything!  

---

Nobody knows a God damn thing right now!

---

So that’s what I was thinking when I got involved with Ginnie, 

---

and I’m sorry to have hurt your feelings.

---

I know I did and I’m sorry.

---

But it’s wartime and I’m scared to death.

---

I shouldn’t say it.

---

It’s not very manly or brave, but it’s how I feel, and I’m very sorry.

---

I’m sure you don’t want to write any more and I understand.

---

I hope we do get to meet some day.

---

I’ll bet we’d have been pretty good friends.

---

Good luck with the tour and with everything else.

---

You deserve it.

---

Jack

## LOUISE:
June 12th, 1944

---

Dear Jack,

---

What the hell’s the matter with you?

---

Can’t you ever write to a girl and say hello?

---

## JACK:
Do you even want me to say hello?

---

## LOUISE:
Yes, funnily enough I do.

---

Though I don’t think "funnily" is actually a word.

---

## JACK:
It’s not.

---

I looked it up once.

---

## LOUISE:
Where are you now?

---

To the extent that the goddam army let’s you say anything about your goddam location.

---

## JACK:
I’m in France, but I can’t tell you where in France.

---

## LOUISE:
Well isn’t that a surprise.

---

What are you doing in France?

---

## JACK:
Well, there was this little thing called D-Day 

---

where we tried to establish a second front in Europe by landing a million men under German fire.

---

I was in it, though a little towards the back end, as were most of the doctors.

---

Which means we landed on the third day instead of the first.

---

## LOUISE:
Oh my God.

---

## JACK:
The goal, by mid-August, is to have two million men over here, 

---

along with 40,000 aircraft and 120,000 tanks.

---

They say it will be the largest fighting force in history, 

---

but I wonder if the buildup on the Eastern Front doesn’t beat it already.

---

## LOUISE:
You would know.

---

That’s your department.

---

## JACK:
My department is amputation and skin grafts.

---

## LOUISE:
Over here they say that D-Day was a great success.

---

## JACK:
On the first day we lost 6,000 men.

---

In all, 73,000 men were killed or reported missing in action.

---

Another 150,000 were wounded, which is my department.

---

The other docs and I do about sixteen hours a day and we still can’t keep up.

---

But we do manage to save a lot of these kids thanks to penicillin and the new sulfa drugs.

---

## LOUISE:
I know this sounds completely stupid, but is there anything I can do to help?

---

## JACK:
I wish you could.

---

## LOUISE:
Okay, here’s my idea.

---

I’ve decided to write to you every day, 

---

and if my hand falls off by the end of the war, it’s your fault.

---

Did you know your letters only take a week to get here?

---

So I’m assuming it’s the same the other way.

---

And I’ve been in touch with your parents and Betty quite a bit, 

---

and they tell me that they’re writing you also.

---

## JACK:
You’re in touch with my parents and Betty?

---

## LOUISE:
Do you have a problem with that?

---

## JACK:
No, it’s fine.

---

## LOUISE:
By the way, your mother sent you an apple cake and she’s crushed that you never thanked her for it.

---

## JACK:
It was covered with mold, and I didn’t want to tell her and hurt her feelings.

---

## LOUISE:
You idiot.

---

Just tell her it arrived in perfect condition and that you loved it.

---

It’ll make her feel like she’s doing something.

---

## JACK:
Good point.

---

Tell her I’m sorry.

---



Have you been dating?

---

## LOUISE:
No.

---

You?

---

## JACK:
No.

---

## LOUISE:
Hey, guess what?

---

Now that the tour is over, I have a new job.

---

I’m a hostess at the Stage Door Canteen in New York.

---

It’s run by the Red Cross, did you know that?

---

It’s meant to be a place where soldiers can get a square meal

---

and some entertainment when they’re passing through town.

---

Most of my time is spent waiting tables and working in the kitchen,

---

 but we also dance with any of the soldiers who want to.

---

As you can imagine, that’s a terrible burden for me.

---

We also have very specific rules about how to talk to the guys who have been in combat.

---

For example, we’re supposed to use the word “prosthetics” instead of “artificial limbs,” 

---

and we’re never supposed to say “it could have been worse.”  

---

I guess because, for them, it couldn’t have been worse.

---

So how are things in France or wherever the heck you are and can’t tell me?

---

Did you get to Paris?

---

I heard that somebody liberated it.

---

## JACK:
Yeah, that was us.

---

## LOUISE:
I want to go to Paris some day.

---

Will you take me?

---

---

Jack?

---


## JACK:
We’re in the villages now and the people line the streets and cheer for us.

---


Not all, but most.

---

They say they were treated like dogs by the Germans—

---

in some cases made to clean their latrines, in other cases lined up and shot.

---

At first I wondered how much of it was true, but I treat German Prisoners of War all the time 

---

and they confirm every word of it.

---

They say they were forced into it by their superior officers—

---

that, of course, is  the universal excuse.

---

But none of them seem very cut up about it.

---

They also admit to rounding up the Jews in the villages

---

and sending them to the concentration camps.

---

It’s just…

---

## LOUISE:
Hey!  Have you heard the news?

---

There’s talk in the paper about the war being over soon.

---

Have you heard anything?

---

## JACK:
That was the talk a few weeks ago, but the Germans have launched a new offensive 

---

to retake Belgium and the Netherlands.

---

They say that this time it really is the biggest land battle in history, 

---

and we just got orders to head that way to deal with the wounded.

---

---
Last night our truck got lost in the dark, and we suddenly found ourselves under fire.

---

But as black as it was, the driver managed to stay on the road and got us out of there.

---

We all bought him drinks last night in the mess.

---

## LOUISE:
You were under fire?

---

## JACK:
Yes of course.

---

But we have a red cross on the side of our truck that’s meant to protect us.

---

## LOUISE:
Well I’m glad to hear that.

---

Jack, are you there?

---

## JACK:
Yes, I’m here.

---

Sorry.

---

We’re getting thousands of patients from the battle up north,

---

and there’s just no time left for any of us.

---

## LOUISE:
Don’t say you’re sorry.

---

It’s my fault.

---

I know you’re there and I shouldn’t ask.

---

I also know that letters from Europe are getting delayed a lot these days, 

---

but I get impatient.

---

I’m the impatient type.

---

You’ve probably never noticed that.

---

## JACK:
Never.

---

You amaze me.

---

---

So tell me about the Stage Door Canteen.

---

Do any big stars ever stop by?

---

Ones I’d recognize?

---

## LOUISE:
Well, last week we had Lana Turner and Paulette Goddard.

---

## JACK:
Hey, I know them.

---

## LOUISE:
No kidding.

---



template: noise

---

Jack, are you being careful?

---

## JACK:
Tremendously.

---

Though I’m not sure that the Red Cross emblem is all it’s cracked up to be.

---

Yesterday, one of the hospitals was shelled so badly 

---

that some of the doctors had to carry the patients through an open field to get away.

---

---

Listen:  I know I shouldn’t be telling  you any of this.

---

And it’s not to frighten you.

---

You know that.

---

I tell you because if something happens to me, 

---

I want to know that I’ve told somebody that there are thousands and thousands of us over here 

---

trying to prevent harm, not inflict it.

---

Does that make any sense at all?

---

Maybe not.

---

Maybe I’m just tired.

---

And I don’t want to sound maudlin.

---

I’m sure you have enough on your plate.

---

But do me a favor.

---

I know this sounds really, really stupid—

---

isn’t that what you said to me once about something:  

---

“I know this sounds really, really stupid?”—

---

but if anything happens to me, please go to my parents and tell them that I think about them all the time.

---

And of you.

---

## LOUISE:
I think about you too, Jack.

---

All the time.

---

But if you think for a minute you can get out of dancing with me 

---

with some lame excuse about serving in the U.S. Army, you’ve got another think coming.

---

So get the hell back here.

---

Got it?

---

## JACK:
Got it.

---

## LOUISE:
And do you know what else?

---
template: noise
loud explosion, gunfire, sirens
---

I’ve made a decision.

---

I’m going to write to you twice a day, just to bore the pants off you, 

---

and I won’t even expect to hear anything in return.

---

Do we have a deal?

---

---

Jack?

---


Hey, guess what.

---

Guess who stopped by the Canteen yesterday?

---

Your favorite, Heddy Lamar.

---

And she stayed for eight hours serving meals to the men and dancing with nearly all of them.

---

And I told her that my boyfriend wanted to buy a kiss from her.

---

I hope that was all right.

---

Calling you my boyfriend.

---

I thought what the hell.

---

If you’re mad, you’re mad.

---

Anyway, I liked the sound of it.

---

What do you think?

---

---

You know, stars come by all the time, 

---

and in the last two weeks we’ve had Dorothy Lamour and Bette Davis.

---

They both work for the war effort night and day.

---

Did you know that?

---

Them and Bob Hope.

---

And Ann Miller and  Jimmy Stewart.

---

Did you know that?

---

Hey by the way.

---

Do you remember me telling you about Ginger Rogers being one of my heroes?

---

Well where do you think she and her mother have a house?

---

Guess.

---

In Medford, Oregon.

---

Honest to God.

---

I just read about it in the papers.

---

They were on some sort of vaudeville tour there when they were younger and they fell in love with the place.

---

So when you get back, I think we should go see the house.

---

What do you think?

April 10, 1945

---

Dear Louise,

---

It’s Greg.

---

Greg Baird.

---

Remember me?

---

I’m the guy you met in Kansas City last year—

---

the one who tried to get to know you better, even though I knew that you and Jack were an item.

---

I know that I apologized already for that and I apologize again.

---

But that’s not why I’m writing.

---

I’m writing to tell you that Jack is Missing in Action.

---



(sobbing) I’m really sorry.

---

I realized suddenly yesterday that you wouldn’t be informed officially 

---

because you’re not part of his family, 

---

and I figured that Jack’s mom and dad would be so upset 

---

that they might not get in touch with you for a while.

---

And I thought you deserved to know right away.

---

For what it’s worth, Jack was about the best guy I ever knew.

---

A real friend. 
---
Anyway, I thought you should know, and I’m sorry to be the one to tell you.

---

Everybody here in Medford is praying for him.

---

Greg

Dear Louise, It’s Jack.

---

You may not be getting this letter until weeks after I send it.

---

I understand that letters have been delayed a lot lately, 

---

and it may be month or two late at this point.

---

Anyway, I sure hope you get this, now that I’m back home.

---

happy sobbing
---

I just spoke with my parents—I called them when I hit New <br>York—

---

## BOTH:
and they were so relieved.

---

## JACK:
They received a notice from the Army that I was missing in action and they thought the worst.

---

Well I was missing.

---

Half our platoon was lost somewhere behind enemy lines.

---



Anyway, I’m in New York right now, but I lost your telephone number  

---

and I don’t know how to get in touch with you except by letter.

---

I hear there’s going to be a big celebration in Times Square for VE Day, 

---

and I was hoping maybe we could meet there.

---

What do you think?

---
template: noise
large murmuring crowd

---

Somebody told me there’s a fountain at the end of some building 

---

that comes to a point in a sort of triangle, and I’m going to go find it, 

---

and I’ll be there all day, hoping to see you.

---

I suppose the question is whether we’ll recognize each other.

---

I’ve got your picture, of course.

---

I’ve got it right here with me –

---

## LOUISE:
Jack???!!!

---

## JACK:
Louise???!!!

---

## LOUISE:
JACK???!!!

---

## JACK:
LOUISE???!!!

---

## LOUISE:
Jack.

## JACK:
