## BOLETTE:
Ballested, got that untangled?
---
## BALLESTED:
Just about.
---
Are you expecting visitors?
---
## BOLETTE:
Mr. Arnholm this morning.
---
He got into town last night.
---
## BALLESTED:
Arnholm?
Do I know him?
---
Wasn't there an Arnholm
who was the tutor here?
---
Some years ago?
---
## BOLETTE:
That's right.
---
He's the one.
---
## BALLESTED:
So he's back here.
---
## BOLETTE:
That's why we want
to fly the flags.
---
## BALLESTED:
I see, I see--
---
Up, up and away.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
Good morning. 
---
## BALLESTED:
Good morning.
---
I'd shake your hand,
but I don't think I know you.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
You're a painter.
---
## BALLESTED:
I am. Why not?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
Do you mind if I...?
---
## BALLESTED:
You want to take a look it?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
Very much.
---
## BALLESTED:
There's not much to see yet,
but you're welcome to come on in.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
Thank you.
---
## BALLESTED:
That stretch of the fiord,
---
with the island...
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
I can see that.
---
## BALLESTED:
I haven't painted
---
in the figure yet.
I can't get anyone in town to model.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
There's going to be a figure?
---
## BALLESTED:
By this rock in the foreground,
I plan to have
---
a dying mermaid lying there.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
Dying?
---
## BALLESTED:
She strayed in from the sea,
---
and can't find her way back.
---
So she lies there dying, inch by inch,
in the brackish water.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
I understand.
---
## BALLESTED:
The lady here asked me
---
to paint this.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
What are you going to call it?
---
## BALLESTED:
'The Mermaid's Last Breath.'
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
Nice.
An interesting theme.
---
## BALLESTED:
You an artist yourself?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
A painter you mean?
---
## BALLESTED:
Yes
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
No.
---
I'm going to be a sculptor.
---
My name is Hans Lyngstrand...
---
## BALLESTED:
You hope to be a sculptor?
---
That's a fine art too.
---
I think I've seen you
in the street once or twice.
---
Have you been here long?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
A couple of weeks.
---
I'm hoping to stay the summer.
---
## BALLESTED:
And enjoy the fun, right?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
More to get my strength back.
---
## BALLESTED:
You've been ill?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
A little bit.
---
It's nothing to worry about.
---
Just a shortness of breath in my chest.
---
## BALLESTED:
That's probably nothing,
but I'd see a doctor about that.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
I thought I'd try
and speak with Dr. Wangle 
---
if the opportunity presented itself.
---
## BALLESTED:
Do that.
---
Here comes another steamer.
Packed with tourists.
---
Amazing how that business
has grown so fast.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
They never stop coming.
---
## BALLESTED:
And then
there's the summer people.
---
I start to worry the town's going to lose
its character to this foreign invasion.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
You're from here.
---
## BALLESTED:
No, I'm not.
---
But, it's home now.
---
I've lived here long enough
to call it that.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
How long have you lived here?
---
## BALLESTED:
Seventeen, eighteen years.
---
I came here with a theater company,
but we got into money troubles,
---
so we split up and scatted to the winds.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
But you stayed.
---
## BALLESTED:
I stayed.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
Good morning, Miss Wangel.
---
## BOLETTE:
Mr. Lyngstrand, good morning.
---
Excuse me for a minute.
---
## BALLESTED:
You know the family?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
Just a little.
---
I've met the young ladies once or twice
at parties, and I met Mrs. Wangel 
---
at the last band concert
in the park.
---
She said I could come by
and see them sometime.
---
## BALLESTED:
You should get to know them.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
Yes, I've been looking
for some excuse to visit.
---
## BALLESTED:
An excuse?
---
You don't need an excuse. 
---
Damn it...
---
The steamer's already docking.
---
I need to be at the hotel.
---
Maybe there's work for me.
---
I also cut hair.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
What don't you do you?
---
## BALLESTED:
It's a small town.
---
You do what you have to do.
---
If you ever need a haircut or whatever,
just ask for Ballested, the dance teacher.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
You teach dance?
---
## BALLESTED:
Or ask
for the President of the Musical Society.
---
We've got a concert tonight in the park.
---
Goodbye. 
---
Goodbye.
---
## HILDA:
Bolette said you were here.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
I found myself here
in the garden.
---
## HILDA:
Have you been out walking?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
Not really.
---
## HILDA:
Have you been swimming?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
A short dip.
I saw your mother down there.
---
Going into the bath house.
---
## HILDA:
Who?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
Your mother.
---
## HILDA:
Oh.
---
## BOLETTE:
Did you see
father's boat out there?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
I saw
a sailboat headed this way.
---
## BOLETTE:
That must be father.
---
He's been visiting patients out
on the islands.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
Those are beautiful flowers.
---
## BOLETTE:
Don't they look nice?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
Is today something special?
---
## HILDA:
It is.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
I guessed that. What?
---
Your father's birthday?
---
## BOLETTE:
Uh-uh.
---
## HILDA:
No, mother's.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
Your mother's, really?
---
## BOLETTE:
Hilda!
---
## HILDA:
Leave me alone.
---
I suppose you're headed home for lunch.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
Yes,
I should be getting something to eat.
---
## HILDA:
You must eat like a king
at the hotel.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
Oh, I'm not at the hotel anymore.
---
I couldn't afford it.
---
## HILDA:
Where are you then?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
A room at Mrs. Jensen's.
---
## HILDA:
Which Mrs. Jensen?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
The midwife.
---
## HILDA:
Excuse me, Mr. Lyngstrand,
I am very busy.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
I shouldn't have brought that up.
---
## HILDA:
Brought up what?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
What I just said.
---
## HILDA:
I don't understand.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
I better say goodbye, ladies.
---
## HILDA:
Adieu, monsieur.
---
## BOLETTE:
Hilda, stop it.
---
Are you crazy?
He could hear you.
---
## WANGEL:
I'm back, girls!
---
## BOLETTE:
I'm glad you're back.
---
## HILDA:
Is that it for today, father?
---
## WANGEL:
Oh no, I'm needed
at the surgery in a little while.
---
Tell me, has Arnholm arrived?
---
## BOLETTE:
Yes, he got into town last night.
---
We asked at the hotel.
---
## WANGEL:
But you haven't seen him?
---
## BOLETTE:
Not yet.
He'll come by this afternoon.
---
## WANGEL:
Of course, he will.
---
## HILDA:
Father, look around.
---
## WANGEL:
I see, it's very festive.
---
## BOLETTE:
And beautifully arranged?
---
## WANGEL:
Yes, of course. Is--?
---
Are we alone?
---
## HILDA:
Yes, she's gone to--
---
## BOLETTE:
Mother's swimming.
---
## WANGEL:
Look here, girls.
---
Is this going to go on all day?
---
And the flag's flying too?
---
## HILDA:
Of course, it is, father!

## WANGEL:
But--
---
## BOLETTE:
You know how this is,
all in honor of Mr. Arnholm.
---
Afterall when an old friend comes back
for the first time to visit.
---
## HILDA:
Remember, father,
he was Bolette's tutor.
---
## WANGEL:
You two little rogues. Look.
---
Look, it's only natural
that we remember her
---
who is no longer with us.
---
But still-- Here, Hilda.
---
Can you take this down to my office.
---
No, girls.
I don't like this.
---
How you're going about this.
---
To do this every year--
I don't know.
---
I suppose it'll never be different.
---
## HILDA:
Look.
---
Look there coming down the road.
---
I think it's Mr. Arnholm.
---
## BOLETTE:
Him?
---
What are you talking about?
---
That man's old.
That's not Mr. Arnholm.
---
## WANGEL:
Wait, wait.
Before you say anything else.
---
I'd bet my life that that's--
it's him, I'm sure.
---
Arnholm, welcome!
---
Welcome back to your old haunts!
---
## ARNHOLM:
Thank you, Dr. Wangel.
A thousand thanks.
---
The children are here!
---
I hardly recognize these two.
---
## WANGEL:
I'm not surprised.
---
## ARNHOLM:
Maybe Bolette.
I'd have recognized Bolette.
---
## WANGEL:
Maybe, maybe not.
It's been what eight, nine years.
---
A lot of changes since then.
---
## ARNHOLM:
I don't know.
---
The trees have grown.
---
## WANGEL:
I didn't mean it that way.
---
## ARNHOLM:
Now you have
two grown-up daughters.
---
## WANGEL:
Only one's grown up.
---
## HILDA:
Father!
---
## BOLETTE:
Should I set out
a little lemonade?
---
## WANGEL:
Do that, girls. Lemonade.
---
And a little cognac.
---
## BOLETTE:
Cognac too?
---
## WANGEL:
A little.
---
Just in case.
---
## BOLETTE:
All right.
---
Hilda, will you take father's coat down
to the office?
---
## ARNHOLM:
Lovely girls.
They've grown into lovely girls.
---
## WANGEL:
They have, haven't they?
---
## ARNHOLM:
Bolette is a surprise,
and Hilda for that matter.
---
But you, Doctor, have you settled here
now for good?
---
## WANGEL:
For good.
I suppose that's true.
---
I was born and grew up here,
did you know that?
---
And lived very happily with her here,
until she was taken away.
---
She was still with us
when you were here, Arnholm.
---
## ARNHOLM:
Yes. Yes.
---
## WANGEL:
And now I'm happy
with she who has taken her place.
---
I have to admit,
the fates have been good to me.
---
## ARNHOLM:
No children
from your second marriage?
---
## WANGEL:
We had a little boy, two, two
and half years ago,
---
but we didn't keep him long.
---
He died when he was four, five months old.
---
## ARNHOLM:
Is your wife not home today?
---
## WANGEL:
She'll be back soon.
---
She went for a swim.
---
She never misses a day this time of year
in all sorts of weather.
---
## ARNHOLM:
For her health?
---
## WANGEL:
Not exactly.
---
She gets anxious though,
has for the last couple of years,
---
it comes and goes.
I don't know what's wrong.
---
Swimming in the sea, she lives for that.
---
## ARNHOLM:
Yes, I remember that about her.
---
## WANGEL:
That's right, you knew Ellida
when you taught out at Skioldvik.
---
## ARNHOLM:
Yes.
She often used to stop at the parsonage.
---
Mostly I saw her when I visited
her father at the lighthouse.
---
## WANGEL:
Life out there has left a deep impression,
as you can imagine.
---
People in town here can't understand.
---
They call her ‘the lady from the sea.'
---
## ARNHOLM:
Do they.
---
## WANGEL:
Look here.
---
Talk to her about the old days, Arnholm.
---
It'll do her good.
---
## ARNHOLM:
Why do you think that?
---
## WANGEL:
I just do.
---
## ELLIDA:
Wangel, are you back?
---
## WANGEL:
I am, my dear.
---
Here comes the mermaid!
---
## ELLIDA:
Thank God, you're home safe.
---
When did you get back?
---
## WANGEL:
Just now. Moments ago.
---
You have nothing to say to an old friend?
---
## ELLIDA:
So you came? Welcome!
---
I'm sorry I wasn't here.
---
## ARNHOLM:
Please. There's no need.
---
## WANGEL:
How's the water.
Nice and cool?
---
## ELLIDA:
Cool?
When is the water ever cool here?
---
It's lukewarm at best.
---
The water in the fiords is bad for you.
---
## ARNHOLM:
Bad?
---
## ELLIDA:
Bad, and I think
it can make you sick.
---
## WANGEL:
A nice testimonial
for the tourist trade.
---
## ARNHOLM:
Mrs. Wangel, I'd say you have a special appreciation for the open sea
---
and everything it touches.
---
## ELLIDA:
You're probably right.
---
Sometimes I think that.
---
Do you see how beautifully the girls
have been decorating the place
---
in your honor?
--

## WANGEL:
Right. I should be going.
---
## ARNHOLM:
In my honor?
---
## ELLIDA:
Of course.
We don't look like this every day!
---
It's suffocating.
Come down here. Over here.
---
Here there's a bit of breeze at least.
---
## ARNHOLM:
I have to say ever
and the air around here is so much fresher.
---
## ELLIDA:
You're too used to Christiania.
---
I've heard
it's terrible there in the summer.
---
## WANGEL:
Ellida, I leave you
to entertain our good friend.
---
## ELLIDA:
You have work to do?
---
## WANGEL:
I'm needed at the surgery.
---
I won't be long.
---
## ARNHOLM:
Don't rush, Doctor.
---
Your wife and I will pass the time.
---
## WANGEL:
I'm sure that's true.
---
Goodbye then.
---
## ELLIDA:
It's a nice place to sit.
---
## ARNHOLM:
I agree.
---
Do you sit out here often?
---
## ELLIDA:
Most of the day.
---
## ARNHOLM:
With the girls I guess.
---
## ELLIDA:
No, they like the porch.
---
## ARNHOLM:
And Wangel?
---
## ELLIDA:
Back and forth.
---
Sometimes here,
sometimes with the children.
---
## ARNHOLM:
That's how you want it?
---
## ELLIDA:
It works fine for all of us.
---
We can still talk to each other,
whenever we happen
---
to have anything to say.
---
## ARNHOLM:
When last our paths
crossed out at Skioldvik.
---
That's a long time ago now.
---
## ELLIDA:
It's at least ten years
since you were out there with us.
---
## ARNHOLM:
About that.
---
When I think of you out there
at the lighthouse.
---
‘The heathen', that's what the pastor
used to call you.
---
Your father gave you the name of a ship,
and not a proper Christian name.
---
## ELLIDA:
So what?
---
## ARNHOLM:
The last thing I'd have imagined
is that we would meet again, here,
---
and you as Mrs. Wangel.
---
## ELLIDA:
I wasn't then.
---
Wangel wasn't yet a--
The girls' mother was alive.
---
I mean their real mother.
## ARNHOLM:
Of course. Of course.
---
But even if that hadn't been,
even if he'd been free,
---
I'd never have expected this.
---
## ELLIDA:
Me neither.
---
Never in a million years, not then.
---
## ARNHOLM:
Wangel's a good man,
really respected, generous, and kind.
---
## ELLIDA:
He is.
---
## ARNHOLM:
But he must be
---
so completely different from you.
---
## ELLIDA:
True.
We are very different.
---
## ARNHOLM:
How did it happen?
---
What happened?
---
## ELLIDA:
Arnholm, don't ask.
I can't really explain it to you.
---
Even if I could, you couldn't understand.
---
## ARNHOLM:
Have you ever told
your husband about me?
---
I mean, about the efforts,
unsuccessful as they were,
---
which I was once rash enough to make?
---
## ELLIDA:
Of course not.
Not a word about any of that.
---
## ARNHOLM:
Good.
---
I was a little embarrassed
---
just thinking about what--
---
## ELLIDA:
You needn't be.
---
I've only told him the truth.
---
I liked you very much, you the closest
---
and best friend I had out there.
---
## ARNHOLM:
Thank you.
---
## ELLIDA:
There's been no one else?
---
## ARNHOLM:
Never.
---
I've stayed faithful to my memories.
---
## ELLIDA:
That's ridiculous.
---
Let them go.
Better to think about getting married.
---
## ARNHOLM:
I suppose I have no time to lose.
---
Look at me, I'll never see
the other side of thirty-seven again.
---
## ELLIDA:
There's your need to hurry.
---
Listen, I'm going to tell you something now
that I couldn't have told you then,
---
even if my life had depended on it.
---
## ARNHOLM:
What?
---
## ELLIDA:
When you offered,
I couldn't have answered otherwise.
---
## ARNHOLM:
I know that.
---
We were just friends.
I know that.
---
## ELLIDA:
No, but you didn't know
that all my thoughts
---
were with someone else at that time.
---
## ARNHOLM:
At that time?
---
## ELLIDA:
At that time.
---
## ARNHOLM:
What?
---
At that time I don't think you
even know Dr. Wangel.
---
## ELLIDA:
I'm not talking about Wangel.
---
## ARNHOLM:
I can't imagine
there was another creature
---
in all of Skioldvik
you could have had any interest in.
---
## ELLIDA:
True. It was crazy.
---
## ARNHOLM:
What?
---
## ELLIDA:
All you need to know
is that I wasn't free then,
---
and now you know.
---
## ARNHOLM:
And if you had been free?
---
## ELLIDA:
What?
---
## ARNHOLM:
Would you have answered me differently?
---
## ELLIDA:
How do I know?
---
When Wangel asked,
I gave him a different answer.
---
## ARNHOLM:
Why are you telling me all this now?
---
## ELLIDA:
Because I need someone to talk to.
---
## ARNHOLM:
Your husband doesn't know?
---
## ELLIDA:
From the very beginning,
I told him
---
that I had once been drawn elsewhere.
---
He didn't want to know more,
and we've never talked about it since.
---
Why?
---
It was crazy, and it ended very quickly.
---
At least, in a way, it did.
---
## ARNHOLM:
So did it end or didn't end?
---
## ELLIDA:
Of course it did.
---
It's not what you think.
It's something incomprehensible.
---
I don't have words to describe it.
---
You'd only think that I was sick
or stark raving mad.
---
## ARNHOLM:
Mrs. Wangel, you have to tell me
the whole story.
---
## ELLIDA:
I can try, but how can you,
with your common sense,
---
ever be able to understand--
Shh, someone's coming.
---
Mr. Lyngstrand, are you looking
for the girls?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
Mrs. Wangel. It's you.
---
No, not really, not the young ladies.
---
It was you yourself, Mrs. Wangel.
---
You said I could come by
and see you sometime.
---
Fortunately, I happened to hear
that today is a very special day.
---
## ELLIDA:
You know that?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
I brought you these,
Mrs. Wangel.
---
## ELLIDA:
Mr. Lyngstrand,
shouldn't you be giving these
---
to Mr. Arnholm?
---
template: overlap
## ELLIDA:
It's in his honor that--

## LYNGSTRAND:
I'm sorry,
---
I don't know this gentleman.
---
No, I meant-- It's a birthday present.
---
## ELLIDA:
Birthday?
No, you're mistaken.
---
Today isn't anyone's birthday here.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
I see.
---
I didn't know it was a secret.
---
## ELLIDA:
Didn't know what?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
That's it's your birthday,Mrs. Wangle...
---
## ELLIDA:
Mine?
---
## ARNHOLM:
Today?
It's not today.
---
## ELLIDA:
Who told you that?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
Miss Hilda let it slip.
---
I happened by here earlier
and asked the young ladies
---
what they were celebrating
with the flowers and the flags--
---
## ELLIDA:
And--?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
And Miss Hilda said,
---
‘It's mother's birthday.'
---
## ELLIDA:
Mother's--? I see.
---
## ARNHOLM:
Of course.
---
Well, Mrs. Wangel,
since the young man has found out--
---
## ELLIDA:
Yes, since you've found out--
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
Please accepted
my congratulations.
---
## ELLIDA:
Many thanks.
---
Won't you, please, sit down for a moment,
Mr. Lyngstrand?
---
All this, about my birthday,
it was meant to be a secret
---
to Mr. Arnholm.
---
## ARNHOLM:
I see that.
---
Just for the family.
---
## ELLIDA:
Yes, just family.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
Your secret's safe with me.
---
I won't tell a living soul.
---
## ELLIDA:
It's not that important.
---
Anyway, how are you?
---
I think that you are looking better.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
I think I am.
Nearly all well.
---
Next year, I hope to get to the south--
---
## ELLIDA:
The girls told me that.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
I have a patron in Bergen
who helps me out,
---
and he's said he'll help me go next year.
---
## ELLIDA:
How did you meet him?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
Pure luck.
---
I'd been on a voyage on one of his ships.
---
## ELLIDA:
You?
---
You wanted to be a sailor?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
No, never.
---
But after my mother died,
my father didn't want me hanging around,
---
so he sent to sea.
---
On the way home, we were shipwrecked
in the Channel, and that was lucky for me.
---
## ARNHOLM:
Really?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
In the shipwreck,
I contracted this weakness in my chest,
---
this lesion.
---
The water was ice-cold and it was ages
before they rescued me,
---
so I had to give up the sea.
---
A stroke of luck.
---
## ARNHOLM:
You really think so?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
Yes, the lesion is nothing,
and now I can do what I want,
---
become a sculptor.
---
Dig my fingers into the soft clay,
and make things.
---
## ELLIDA:
What will you make?
---
Mermaids, Mer-men? Old Vikings?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
Nothing like that.
---
As soon as I feel ready,
I want to try my hand at a group scene.
---
## ELLIDA:
What sort of group?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
One out of my own life.
---
## ARNHOLM:
Good.
Stay close to that.
---
## ELLIDA:
What is it?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
I thought I'd have
a young woman, a sailor's wife, sleeping,
---
and while she sleeps she dreams.
---
I think I can make it clear
that she's dreaming.
---
## ARNHOLM:
What else?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
Another figure,
more of a shape.
---
The husband,
to whom she has been unfaithful
---
while he was away,
and now he has drowned.
---
## ARNHOLM:
What?
---
## ELLIDA:
Drowned?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
He drowned at sea,
but the strange thing is
---
he still comes home.
---
It's night and he stands by her bedside
and looks down at her.
---
He should be dripping wet
as if just hauled out of the sea.
---
## ELLIDA:
What a strange idea.
I can picture it.
---
## ARNHOLM:
Mr-- You said it was something
you'd experienced.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
In a way, I have.
---
## ARNHOLM:
You've seen a dead man
hauled out of the sea
---
template: overlap
## ARNHOLM:
and standing captive?

## LYNGSTRAND:
No, no.
---
I don't mean it's something
I've actually seen, but still--
---
## ELLIDA:
What?
Tell me more.
---
I don't understand.
---
## ARNHOLM:
This is right up your alley,
anything about the sea.
---
## ELLIDA:
Please, tell me more.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
We were set to sail for home
from a town called Halifax
---
when we had to leave
our bosun behind in the hospital.
---
So an American took his place.
---
This new bosun--
---
## ELLIDA:
American?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
Yes.
---
One day he borrowed a pile
of old newspapers from the captain.
---
He said he wanted to learn Norwegian.
---
## ELLIDA:
And then?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
Then one evening
when the wind was howling,
---
all hands-on deck,
except for the bosun and me.
---
He'd sprained his ankle, I was in my bunk.
---
He sat there, reading those old papers
---
template: overlap
## ELLIDAL
And?

## LYNGSTRAND:
as usual...
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
And all of a sudden,
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
he screams,
---
I look and his face is as white as chalk.
---
He crumpled up and crushed a newspaper,
tore into a thousand pieces,
---
but all of this he did 
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
quietly. 
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
Quietly.
---
## ELLIDA:
Did the sailor say anything?
Speak?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
Not at first.
---
Then, as if to himself,
---
‘married to another while I'm away.'
---
## ELLIDA:
Those words?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
And in perfectly good Norwegian.
---
## ELLIDA:
What happened then?
What happened next?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
This is what's so amazing.
---
I'll never forget until my dying day.
---
He said, and this too very quietly,
---
‘But mine she is,
---
and mine she always shall be.
---
And follow me, she shall,
---
even if I must go home and fetch her,
---
like a drowned man
from the bottom of the sea.'
---
## ELLIDA:
It's so humid today.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
He said this with such a force
of will that I believed he would do it.
---
## ELLIDA:
Do you know
what's become of this sailor?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
Oh, dead, Mrs. Wangel.
---
I'm sure of that.
---
## ELLIDA:
What makes you so sure?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
We were shipwrecked
right after this in the Channel.
---
I was rescued in the long boat
with the captain and five others.
---
The mate went in the dingy,
and the American was with him and one more.
---
## ELLIDA:
And they were lost?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
They were, Mrs. Wangel.
---
My patron reminded me of this
just the other day.
---
I can't wait to try and sculpt this scene.
---
I see the sailor's faithless wife
so life-like,
---
and the drowned avenger come home
from the sea.
---
I see them both so clearly.
---
## ELLIDA:
So do I.
---
Come, let's go in.
---
Or rather over there.
---
It's suffocating here.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
Oh, I should be going.
---
I only stopped by to wish you
a 
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
[whispers] 
happy birthday.
---
## ELLIDA:
You must go,
goodbye and thank you for the flowers.
---
## ARNHOLM:
This has upset you?
---
## ELLIDA:
I suppose it has.
---
## ARNHOLM:
It can't come as a surprise.
---
## ELLIDA:
A surprise?
---
## ARNHOLM:
You must expect this.
---
## ELLIDA:
To return?
In this way?
---
## ARNHOLM:
Mrs. Wangel,
what are you talking about?
---
Not the crazy sculptor's tall tale.
---
## ELLIDA:
It may not be as crazy
as you think, Arnholm.
---
## ARNHOLM:
The nonsense about a dead man,
that's what upset you?
---
I thought you--
---
## ELLIDA:
What?
---
What did you think?
---
## ARNHOLM:
I thought you were covering
for being hurt.
---
The birthday being celebrated
without telling you,
---
the memories that your husband
and children share, and you don't.
---
## ELLIDA:
No, no, that is what it is.
---
I haven't the right to claim my husband
only for myself.
---
## ARNHOLM:
I think you'd have that right.
---
## ELLIDA:
I know that I don't.
---
That is the fact, and I too live a life
in which they have no part.
---
## ARNHOLM:
Mrs. Wangel,
do you love your husband?
---
## ELLIDA:
Of course I do.
---
With all my heart,
and that's why it's so inexplicable,
---
simply inconceivable.
---
## ARNHOLM:
What, Mrs. Wangel?
---
I want you to tell me.
---
## ELLIDA:
I can't, my friend.
Not right now.
---
Maybe some other time.
---
## WANGEL:
Now, here I am,
at last, a free man.
---
A cool glass of something
would be much appreciated.
---
## ELLIDA:
Don't go.
---
## HILDA:
Those are beautiful.
---
Where did they come from?
---
## ELLIDA:
Lyngstrand, the sculptor,
gave them to me.
---
## HILDA:
Lyngstrand?
---
## BOLETTE:
He's been back?
---
## ELLIDA:
To bring these,
as a birthday present, you know.
---
## HILDA:
Idiot.
---
## BOLETTE:
Oh--
---
## WANGEL:
I feel I owe you
an explanation, Ellida.
---
## ELLIDA:
Come on, girls.
---
Let's put these flowers in a vase.
---
## BOLETTE:
See, she's nice.
---
## HILDA:
She's just doing that for father.
---
## WANGEL:
Thank you for understanding.
---
Thank you, Ellida.
---
## ELLIDA:
Nonsense.
---
Shouldn't I too celebrate
their mother's birthday?
---
## ARNHOLM:
Right.
---
template: noise
intense music
---
## BOLETTE:
Why are you running away
from Lyngstrand?
---
## HILDA:
Because I can't stand
climbing hills like that.
---
Look at him,
it's like he's crawling up the hill.
---
## BOLETTE:
You know he's not well.
---
## HILDA:
You think it's serious?
---
## BOLETTE:
I'm sure it is.
---
## HILDA:
He saw father this afternoon.
---
I wonder what father thinks.
---
## BOLETTE:
Father told me
it's something to do with his lungs,
---
he won't live long.
---
## HILDA:
He said that?
---
That's what I thought.
---
## BOLETTE:
For god's sake
don't let him suspect that.
---
## HILDA:
What do you think I am?
---
Look at him.
---
He's almost made it. Hans.
---
We should call him Hans.
---
He looks like a Hans.
---
## BOLETTE:
Behave yourself. Please.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
I'm sorry, I couldn't keep up.
---
I couldn't keep up.
---
## HILDA:
Where did you get the umbrella?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
It's your mother's.
She thought I could use it as a cane.
---
## BOLETTE:
Are they still coming,
father and the others?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
Your father went
into the restaurant for a moment,
---
and the others are sitting outside
listening to the music.
---
They're on their way, your mother said.
---
## HILDA:
I guess that tired you out.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
I am a little tired.
---
I should probably just sit down
for a moment.
---
## HILDA:
Did you know
there's going to be dancing
---
by the bandstand?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
Yes, I heard that.
---
## HILDA:
I'll bet you like to dance.
---
## BOLETTE:
Hilda, let Mr. Lyngstrand
catch his breath.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
I would like to dance
if I could, but I can't.
---
## HILDA:
Because you never learned how?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
No, I haven't,
but that's not what I meant.
---
I meant because of my chest.
---
## HILDA:
The ‘lesion' you spoke about?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
That's right.
---
## HILDA:
Does this ‘lesion' make you very unhappy?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
Not really.
---
I think it's because of it that everyone
is so nice to me.
---
## HILDA:
And it's not really serious?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
No. Not at all.
Your father says it's nothing.
---
## HILDA:
It will just clear up
as soon as you go abroad.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
It will.
---
## HILDA:
Look at these, Mr. Lyngstrand.
---
Here's one for your buttonhole.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
Oh, thank you, Ms. Wangel.
---
That's very sweet.
---
## HILDA:
There they are, on their way up.
---
## BOLETTE:
Do they know where to turn off?
---
No, they're going the wrong way.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
Oh, I can run down
and shout to them.
---
## HILDA:
Can you even shout?
---
## BOLETTE:
No, don't.
---
You'll just tire yourself out.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
No, it's so much easier going downhill.
---
## HILDA:
Downhill.
---
Now he's running.
---
It hasn't occurred to him that he's going
to have to climb back up again.
---
## BOLETTE:
Poor man.
---
## HILDA:
If Lyngstrand
were to propose to you,
---
would you have him?
---
## BOLETTE:
[laughs] Are you out of your mind?
---
## HILDA:
I mean,
say he didn't have this 'lesion'
---
and he wasn't going to die.
---
Would you have him then?
---
## BOLETTE:
Why don't you have him?
---
## HILDA:
[laughs] That's funny.
---
He hasn't a penny.
---
He can't even support himself.
---
## BOLETTE:
You seem obsessed with him.
---
## HILDA:
Only with his ‘lesion.'
---
## BOLETTE:
Then why don't you have
sympathy for him?
---
## HILDA:
I used to,
but now it's more interesting to--
---
## BOLETTE:
To what?
---
## HILDA:
To watch him, and to get him
to say it's nothing serious
---
and that he's going to travel abroad
and be an artist.
---
He's really convinced himself of this,
and it's made him happy.
---
Then to know
it's all going to come to nothing,
---
nothing at all
because he won't live much longer.
---
I find it thrilling to think about.
---
## BOLETTE:
Thrilling?
---
## HILDA:
Thrilling. I just do.
---
## BOLETTE:
Hilda, you are horrible.
---
## HILDA:
I try.
---
Finally,
Arnholm doesn't seem to enjoy climbing.
---
By the way, you know what I noticed
at dinner about Arnholm?
---
## BOLETTE:
What?
---
## HILDA:
He's turning bald,
---
right on the top of his head.
---
## BOLETTE:
[laughs] That's not true.
---
## HILDA:
He's got wrinkles around his eyes.
---
My god, Bolette, what did you see in him
when he was your tutor?
---
## BOLETTE:
Oh, you remember that?
---
I once broke down sobbing
just because he'd said ‘Bolette'
---
was an ugly name.
---
## HILDA:
Think of it.
---
Look. Look there.
---
"The lady from the sea" walking with him,
not with father.
---
Yapping away with him.
---
You think those two are a little sweet
on each other?
---
## BOLETTE:
You should be ashamed of yourself.
---
How can you say
these things like that about her?
---
Just when we're beginning to get along.
---
## HILDA:
Right.
---
Don't fall for that.
---
We will never get along.
---
She's not like us, nor we like her.
---
God only knows what tempted father
to drag her into our home.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if she just up
and went crazy on us one day.
---
## BOLETTE:
Why do you say that?
---
## HILDA:
It wouldn't be a shock.
---
Didn't her mother go mad?
---
And die mad?
---
I know that.
---
## BOLETTE:
Why is that any of your business?
---
And besides, just keep it to yourself.
---
Be good now, for father's sake.
Do you hear me?
---
## ARNHOLM:
You're right.
It's in that direction.
---
## ELLIDA:
It's over there.
---
Over there is the sea.
---
## BOLETTE:
Beautiful up here, isn't it?
---
## ARNHOLM:
Very, amazing view.
---
## BOLETTE:
Over there, on Pilot's Knoll,
the view is even better.
---
## WANGEL:
Ellida, now that we're alone--
---
## ELLIDA:
Yes.
---
## WANGEL:
It's quiet and peaceful here.
---
Let's have a little talk.
---
## ELLIDA:
What about?
---
## WANGEL:
About you, and about us.
---
I don't think we can continue like this.
---
## ELLIDA:
What would you have us do?
---
## WANGEL:
Be open with each other.
---
Share our lives, as we used to.
---
## ELLIDA:
If only that were possible,
but it's not.
---
## WANGEL:
I think I understand.
---
From things you've said, I think I do.
---
## ELLIDA:
You can't, don't tell me
you understand.
---
## WANGEL:
But I think I do.
---
Yours is an uncompromising nature.
---
You have a faithful heart.
---
## ELLIDA:
I do.
---
## WANGEL:
And you cannot feel secure
and happy in a relationship
---
unless it is full and all-encompassing.
---
## ELLIDA:
Where is this going?
---
## WANGEL:
You are not made
to be a man's second wife.
---
## ELLIDA:
Why are you saying that now?
---
## WANGEL:
I've had my suspicions,
but today it became obvious.
---
The children's memorial festival,
you saw me as an accomplice,
---
and you're right, a man's memories
cannot be taken away, at least mine can't.
---
That's not who I am.
---
## ELLIDA:
I know that.
---
template: overlap
## ELLIDA:
I certainly know that.

## WANGEL:
Still I think you're wrong.
---
To you, it must seem
as though the girl's mother
---
was still alive.
---
You feel her presence in our midst.
---
You think my heart is equally divided
between you and her,
---
and that disgusts you.
---
To you, it makes our life together immoral,
---
and so that is why you now do not
---
or cannot live with me as my wife.
---
## ELLIDA:
And this is what you've seen,
Wangel?
---
## WANGEL:
I have, today.
Right to the source of the problem.
---
## ELLIDA:
The source. Have you.
---
## WANGEL:
And there's more to this, Ellida.
---
## ELLIDA:
What else?
---
## WANGEL:
There's this, you hate living here.
---
The mountains oppress you, weigh on you.
---
There's not enough light,
the horizon isn't wide enough,
---
the air not strong
and stimulating enough for you.
---
## ELLIDA:
That is true.
---
Night and day, winter and summer,
I feel homesick for the sea.
---
## WANGEL:
Ellida, dear, I know that,
---
and so the poor sick one
---
must go home again.
---
## ELLIDA:
What do you mean?
---
## WANGEL:
Just that. We'll move.
---
## ELLIDA:
Move?
---
## WANGEL:
To somewhere by the sea.
---
To someplace where you'll feel at home.
---
## ELLIDA:
You mustn't do that.
That's not possible.
---
You could never be happy anywhere but here.
---
## WANGEL:
So be it.
---
Besides, do you think I could be happy
anywhere without you?
---
## ELLIDA:
But I am here,
and I will stay here.
---
You have me here.
---
## WANGEL:
Do I?
---
## ELLIDA:
Stop this talk.
---
Your life and your work are here.
---
It is all here.
---
## WANGEL:
It is what it is.
---
We'll move, move to the sea somewhere.
---
I've made up my mind, Ellida,
you're not going to change it.
---
## ELLIDA:
No.
Instead-- God help me,
---
I'll tell you the truth,
---
I will tell you everything.
---
## WANGEL:
Do that, Ellida.
---
## ELLIDA:
You can't sacrifice
---
your happiness for my sake.
---
Especially since it wouldn't change
anything with us.
---
## WANGEL:
You said you'd tell me everything.
---
Tell me the truth.
---
## ELLIDA:
I will as best as I can,
---
as much as I understand it myself.
---
Come and sit with me, Wangel.
---
## WANGEL:
Go on, Ellida.
---
## ELLIDA:
That day you came
and asked me to marry you,
---
you spoke frankly
about your first marriage.
---
You said it had been very happy.
---
## WANGEL:
And, so it was.
---
## ELLIDA:
I don't doubt that.
---
I just want to remind you
that I too was frank with you.
---
I told you that I had once cared
for someone else
---
and that it had even reached--
we were kind of engaged.
---
## WANGEL:
Kind of?
---
## ELLIDA:
Something like that.
---
It lasted only a short time.
---
This person went away,
and later I broke it off.
---
I told you all of that.
---
## WANGEL:
Then why repeat it?
---
It doesn't bother me.
---
I never even asked who it was.
---
## ELLIDA:
No, you never have.
---
You're always very considerate.
---
## WANGEL:
And I hardly needed to be told.
---
## ELLIDA:
No?
---
## WANGEL:
Out at Skioldvick, and for miles,
---
there was not a lot to choose from.
---
In fact, only one.
---
## ELLIDA:
You think it was Arnholm.
---
## WANGEL:
Well, wasn't it?
---
## ELLIDA:
No.
---
## WANGEL:
Then I'm confused.
---
## ELLIDA:
Do you remember one year
in late autumn,
---
a large American ship
came into Skioldvick for repairs?
---
## WANGEL:
I remember that very well.
---
Her captain had been murdered in his cabin.
---
I did the autopsy.
---
## ELLIDA:
Yes, you did.
---
## WANGEL:
The second mate killed him.
---
## ELLIDA:
That was never proven.
---
No one knows that.
---
## WANGEL:
I think it was pretty much assumed.
---
If not, why did he drown himself?
---
## ELLIDA:
That sailor didn't drown
but escaped in another ship headed north.
---
## WANGEL:
How do you know this?
---
## ELLIDA:
Because, Wangel,
---
it was this sailor that I was engaged to.
---
## WANGEL:
[chuckles] You're serious?
---
## ELLIDA:
I am.
---
## WANGEL:
How in God's name?
---
Ellida, how could you--?
---
Get engaged to-- A total stranger?
---
What was his name?
---
## ELLIDA:
At the time, it was Friman.
---
Later, in letters, it was Johnston.
---
## WANGEL:
You know anything else about him?
---
## ELLIDA:
Went to sea quite young,
and made a number of long voyages.
---
## WANGEL:
That's it?
---
## ELLIDA:
That's not what we talked about.
---
## WANGEL:
What did you talk about?
---
## ELLIDA:
Mostly about the sea.
---
## WANGEL:
The sea?
---
## ELLIDA:
Storms and calms,
---
dark nights at sea, the sea on sunny days.
---
We talked about gulls and eagles
and every kind of sea bird imaginable,
---
about whales and porpoises and seals
that lie themselves out on the reefs
---
and bask in the midday sun.
---
It's strange, isn't,
that that's what we talked about;
---
seemed to be so at home
with these animals and birds,
---
like they were part of this person.
---
## WANGEL: 
And you.
---
## ELLIDA:
Yes. Yes.
---
I started to think
that they were part of me too.
---
## WANGEL:
I see,
and so you got engaged, why?
---
## ELLIDA:
Said I had to.
---
## WANGEL:
Had you no will of your own?
---
## ELLIDA:
No.
---
No, not when we were near each other,
and then wedded.
---
## WANGEL:
Wedded?
---
## ELLIDA:
When leaving,
---
took a ring off a finger,
---
and took a ring off my finger,
and joined these two together on a keyring
---
and said, "Now the two of us
will be wedded by the sea."
---
## WANGEL:
Wedded?
---
## ELLIDA:
Those words.
---
Then, threw them as far as possible
into the water.
---
## WANGEL:
And you participated in this?
---
## ELLIDA:
I know, it's hard to believe,
but, at the time,
---
it seemed to be the right thing to do.
---
And then, thank God, they went away.
---
## WANGEL:
And, once away?
---
## ELLIDA:
I soon came to my senses
and I saw how utterly mad
---
and meaningless it all had been.
---
## WANGEL:
But you said
something about letters.
---
So you have heard from this person since?
---
## ELLIDA:
I did, yes.
---
The first couple came from Archangel,
on the way to America.
---
Gave me an address there.
---
## WANGEL:
Did you write back?
---
## ELLIDA:
Immediately.
Of course, I wrote that
---
it was over between us.
---
## WANGEL:
Did he keep writing?
---
## ELLIDA:
Wrote me again, yes.
---
## WANGEL:
What did he say
to what you'd told him?
---
## ELLIDA:
Nothing.
---
Wrote as if nothing had changed.
---
Seemed confident I would wait.
---
## WANGEL:
Wouldn't let you end it?
---
## ELLIDA:
No, and so I wrote again,
almost word for word
---
what I'd written before, only tougher.
---
## WANGEL:
And?
---
## ELLIDA:
The same.
---
Wrote back as confidently as before.
---
No mention of anything I'd said.
---
## WANGEL:
He must have had
an extraordinary power over you, Ellida.
---
## ELLIDA:
Yes.
Yes, a terrible--
---
## WANGEL:
Now you mustn't think
about him anymore.
---
Never again.
---
You must promise me that, Ellida.
---
We'll try this other cure.
---
Get away from the
thick air here.
---
You need a sea breeze,
the smell of saltwater.
---
What do you say?
---
## ELLIDA:
No, stop saying that.
---
That won't help me.
---
I know, I feel that it wouldn't be
any different there than here.
---
I can't shake this--
---
## WANGEL:
Shake what?
---
## ELLIDA:
My fear of this person
and that power over me.
---
## WANGEL:
But, you have shaken it off,
years ago, when you broke it off.
---
It's over.
It's been over.
---
## ELLIDA:
No, it's not.
---
## WANGEL:
What?
---
## ELLIDA:
It's not over, Wangel,
and I am so scared
---
that it will never be over,
not in this life.
---
## WANGEL:
Are you saying
that you've never been able
---
to really forget this person?
---
## ELLIDA:
I thought that I had forgotten.
---
Then, for no reason,
it all started coming back.
---
## WANGEL:
When was this?
---
## ELLIDA:
Three years ago, maybe more,
before the baby was born.
---
## WANGEL:
Then.
---
I see.
---
I think I'm beginning to understand.
---
## ELLIDA:
You don't, dear.
---
This thing that comes over me,
I don't think it can be understood.
---
## WANGEL:
So, for three years,
there's been someone else,
---
not me, another?
---
## ELLIDA:
You misunderstand.
I only love you.
---
## WANGEL:
Then how do you explain
not living with me as my wife?
---
## ELLIDA:
Because I am afraid.
---
## WANGEL:
Of what?
---
## ELLIDA:
This strange creature
has made me so afraid.
---
Such a fear that can only rise up
out of the sea.
---
I'll tell you.
---
 [laughter]
---
## BOLETTE:
You're still here?
---
## ELLIDA:
It's nice and cool up here.
---
It's a relief.
---
## ARNHOLM:
We've decided to go dancing.
---
## WANGEL:
Oh, well, we'll come too.
---
In a little while.
---
## HILDA:
See you soon.
---
## ELLIDA:
Oh Lyngstrand, can you wait?
---
Are you going to dance?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
No, Mrs. Wangel.
I better not.
---
## ELLIDA:
Be careful.
---
That weakness in your chest,
you're not quite over that yet.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
No, not quite.
---
## ELLIDA:
I've been meaning to ask,
when was that voyage?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
When I got the lesion?
---
## ELLIDA:
Yes, what you were telling us
about this morning.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
Well, that must be--
Let me think.
---
It must be three years now.
---
## ELLIDA:
Three years?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
Maybe more.
---
We left America in February.
---
We were shipwrecked in March.
---
We hit the equinoctial storms.
---
## ELLIDA:
You see, that was the time.
---
## WANGEL:
What are you saying?
---
## ELLIDA:
Oh, we shouldn't keep you,
---
Mr. Lyngstrand.
Go ahead, 
---
but don't dance.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
I'll just watch.
---
## WANGEL:
What was that about?
---
## ELLIDA:
Johnston was on that ship.
---
I'm positive.
---
## WANGEL:
Why do you think that?
---
## ELLIDA:
And learned, while on that voyage,
that I had married someone else.
---
And it was then, at that moment,
that I felt this--
---
## WANGEL:
The fear.
---
## ELLIDA:
Yes.
---
Sometimes, without warning,
I can see standing right in front of me,
---
a bit to the side,
never looking at me, just there.
---
## WANGEL:
How does he look?
---
## ELLIDA:
The same.
---
## WANGEL:
10 years ago?
---
## ELLIDA:
Yes.
---
Out at Bratthammer,
I can see that scarf pin,
---
with the large bluish-white pearl.
---
That pearl, like the eye of a dead fish,
it glares at me.
---
## WANGEL:
My God.
---
You're more ill than I thought;
more ill than you know yourself, Ellida.
---
## ELLIDA:
So, help me if you can.
---
I can feel it all closing in on me.
---
## WANGEL:
You've been like this
for three years, suffering in silence,
---
without confiding in me.
---
## ELLIDA:
What could I do?
---
If I had told you all of this,
I would also have to tell you
---
what's unspeakable.
---
## WANGEL:
What is that?
---
## ELLIDA:
No, don't ask.
---
One more thing and then I am done.
---
Wangel, how do we explain
the mystery of our child's eyes?
---
## WANGEL:
I told you,
that was something you imagined, Ellida.
---
Our child's eyes were normal.
---
## ELLIDA:
That is not true.
---
Why couldn't you see it?
---
Our child's eyes changed color
with the sea.
---
On calm and sunny days,
the eyes were calm and sunny.
---
On the day of a storm,
I saw this even if you did not.
---
## WANGEL:
Perhaps. Maybe.
But even if so, so what?
---
## ELLIDA:
I have seen eyes like that before.
---
## WANGEL:
When?
---
## ELLIDA:
10 years ago.
---
## WANGEL:
What are you--?
---
## ELLIDA:
Our child had the stranger's eyes.
---
## WANGEL:
Ellida.
---
## ELLIDA:
Maybe now you can understand
why I will never,
---
ever dare to live with you as your wife.
---
## WANGEL:
Ellida. Ellida.
---
template: noise
intense music
---
## HILDA:
Don't move.
---
There's the big one there.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
Where?
---
## HILDA:
You can't see it? There.
---
Holy God, look at that one.
---
## ARNHOLM:
There's still fish in there?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
[shushes]
---
## HILDA:
Very old carp.
---
Were you swimming?
---
## ARNHOLM:
I just changed out of my suit.
---
## HILDA:
You kept within the markers?
---
## ARNHOLM:
I'm no great swimmer.
---
## HILDA:
Can you swim on your back?
---
## ARNHOLM:
No.
---
## HILDA:
I can.
---
Let's try the other side.
---
---
## ARNHOLM:
You're all alone?
---
## BOLETTE:
[screams]
---
I often am.
---
## ARNHOLM:
What are the books?
---
## BOLETTE:
This one's botany
and the other's geography.
---
## ARNHOLM:
That's what you like to read?
---
## BOLETTE:
When I have the time, of course.
---
Taking care of the house,
that comes first.
---
## ARNHOLM:
Doesn't your mother--
your stepmother help you with that?
---
## BOLETTE:
It's my job.
---
I did it after mother died,
and I've kept on doing it.
---
## ARNHOLM:
You always liked to read.
---
## BOLETTE:
True. Useful books.
---
Whatever I can get a hold of.
---
You want to know
something about the world?
---
Here we live so completely cut off
from everything.
---
Well, almost everything.
---
## ARNHOLM:
That's not true, Bolette.
---
## BOLETTE:
I think so.
---
I don't see much difference
between our life and the life of the carp
---
in that pond.
---
The fiord is just there, right near them,
where great shoals of wild fish
---
swim in and out,
but these poor tame house-bound fish
---
know nothing of all that.
---
Can never be a part of that.
---
## ARNHOLM:
I don't think they'd like it
if they found themselves out in the fiord.
---
## BOLETTE:
They might say
it was worth the risk.
---
## ARNHOLM:
Besides,
you can't say you're so very isolated here.
---
Certainly not in the summer,
more like a convergence of many streams.
---
## BOLETTE:
[laughs]
You're one of those streams.
---
Passing through.
---
So it's easy to make fun.
---
## ARNHOLM:
I wasn't making fun.
---
Bolette, why do you say that?
---
## BOLETTE:
All that about
where the many streams--
---
That's how this town now
tries to sell itself.
---
You hear it all the time.
---
## ARNHOLM:
Honestly, I hadn't heard that.
---
## BOLETTE:
Of course,
it's not true you know,
---
for those of us who actually live here.
---
What is it to us if the world
passes by our door on its way
---
to see the midnight sun?
---
We can't join in the stream.
---
There is no midnight sun for us.
---
We must be happy to linger out
our lives here in this pond with the carp.
---
## ARNHOLM:
Tell me, Bolette,
what are you trying to say?
---
What are you really trying to say?
---
What is it you think you're missing here?
---
## BOLETTE:
Something.
---
## ARNHOLM:
What is it?
What do you want?
---
## BOLETTE:
Mostly to get away?
---
## ARNHOLM:
That's the main thing?
---
## BOLETTE:
Yes, and after that,
a chance to learn a little bit more.
---
To understand more about just everything.
---
## ARNHOLM:
Back when I was tutoring you,
your father often said
---
you'd be going off to college.
---
## BOLETTE:
Father often says many things,
but when it comes time to it he--
---
it's often just talk.
---
## ARNHOLM:
I suppose that's true,
but have you asked him?
---
Pressured him?
---
## BOLETTE:
No, I haven't.
---
## ARNHOLM:
Oh, there you go.
You should absolutely do that
---
before it's too late.
Why don't you?
---
## BOLETTE:
I suppose I'm all talk too.
---
I probably take after father.
---
## ARNHOLM:
I wonder
if you're really being fair to yourself.
---
## BOLETTE:
[laughs] That's me.
---
I'm sorry to say.
---
[chuckles] Then father has so little time
for me or my future
---
and seemingly little interest,
and he puts things off,
---
and he's busy with Ellida.
---
## ARNHOLM:
One more reason for you
to get away.
---
## BOLETTE:
True, but I don't feel
I have the right to go away
---
and leave father.
---
## ARNHOLM:
Bolette, you'll have to leave him someday.
---
If what you said is true, then why not go?
---
## BOLETTE:
You're right.
---
I should and think of myself.
---
Find some position.
---
When father's gone, I'll have no one.
---
Poor father.
---
He is weak in certain ways.
I'm sure you've seen that [chuckles].
---
He likes to see smiling faces.
---
"There must be sunshine
and happiness in the house," he says.
---
I think he gives her medicines
just to get her through the day.
---
It does seem unfair, doesn't it?
That I have to stay here.
---
That doesn't really help my father.
---
## ARNHOLM:
Bolette,
we need to keep talking about this.
---
## BOLETTE:
That won't do any good.
---
The fact is, I was created to pass my life
here in this pond with the carp.
---
## ARNHOLM:
Not at all.
That's up to you.
---
## BOLETTE:
You think so?
---
## ARNHOLM:
Yes.
---
Listen to me, Bolette,
your life is in your own hands.
---
## BOLETTE:
If only that were true.
---
Would you be willing to talk
to father about me?
---
## ARNHOLM:
I'll do that, but Bolette,
first, I need to speak to you.
---
Don't say anything.
---
We'll finish this later.
---
## ELLIDA:
It's so nice here.
---
It's really nice.
---
## ARNHOLM:
Are you out for a walk?
---
## ELLIDA:
Yes.
---
A long, long wonderful walk with Wangle,
and now we're going out on the sailboat.
---
## BOLETTE:
Won't you sit down?
---
## ELLIDA:
No, no, no, no, I can't sit.
Can't sit.
---
## ARNHOLM:
Walk's done, you good.
---
You seem exhilarated.
---
## ELLIDA:
Oh, I feel incredibly well
and so very happy and safe, very safe.
---
What is that steamer coming in there?
---
## BOLETTE:
That's probably the English boat.
---
## ARNHOLM:
They're mooring her.
Does she usually stop here?
---
## BOLETTE:
Only for a half-hour or so.
---
She's headed farther up the fiord.
---
## ELLIDA:
And then back out tomorrow.
---
Right across the sea
into the great open sea.
---
Imagine going with her.
---
If only one could.
---
If one could.
---
## ARNHOLM:
Mrs.Wangle,
have you never been on a sea voyage?
---
## ELLIDA:
No.
Just little trips up and down the fiords?
---
## BOLETTE:
No, we are stuck on dry land.
---
## ARNHOLM:
Well, where are we belong.
---
## ELLIDA:
I don't think so.
---
## ARNHOLM:
We don't belong on land?
---
## ELLIDA:
No, I don't believe that.
---
I believe that if from the very beginning
we had had to adapt to a life on the sea,
---
or perhaps in the sea,
we would have a far richer world
---
than we have now.
---
Better and happier.
---
## ARNHOLM:
You really believe that?
---
## ELLIDA:
It's a theory.
I've often discussed it with Wangle.
---
## ARNHOLM:
And he?
---
## ELLIDA:
Well, he thinks
---
there may be something in it.
---
## ARNHOLM:
[laughs] Who knows?
---
But what is, is.
---
Given everything, it's a little late
to go back now.
---
## ELLIDA:
That is the sad truth.
---
I believe we all feel it.
---
It haunts us like a secret sorrow or regret.
---
I think that this lies at the very heart
of the melancholy of humankind.
---
I'm sure it does.
---
## ARNHOLM:
Mrs.Wangle,
I've not found that people
---
are so profoundly sad.
---
On the contrary,
I think most people greet life
---
as it comes for the best,
and with a great, quiet, instinctive joy.
---
## ELLIDA:
That is not so.
---
That joy, it's much like the joy
we feel on these long, light summer days.
---
You know the darkness is coming
and that knowledge casts a shadow
---
over all of one's joy.
---
Much like the drifting clouds
cast their shadows over the fiords.
---
One minute everything is blue and shiny,
and then all of the sudden--
---
## ARNHOLM:
Don't let your mind go there.
---
A minute ago, you were so happy,
so cheerful.
---
## ELLIDA:
I was. You're right.
I'm just being stupid.
---
It was Wangle, he promised,
he swore he would join me,
---
and he doesn't come.
---
He's forgotten.
---
Mr. Arnholm, will you please go
and find him for me?
---
## ARNHOLM:
Of course.
---
## ELLIDA:
Tell him he must come.
I can't picture him.
---
## ARNHOLM:
Can't picture him?
---
## ELLIDA:
Of course, you wouldn't understand.
---
When he's not here, I don't remember
what he looks like,
---
and so I think I've lost him,
and that's painful.
---
Please, go.
---
## BOLETTE:
I'll go with you.
---
You don't know where to--
I think he's gone on board the steamer,
---
and there's a bar on board.
---
template: noise
intense music
---
## THE STRANGER:
Good evening, Ellida.
---
## ELLIDA:
Thank God you've come at last.
---
## THE STRANGER:
[chuckles] Yes. At last.
---
## ELLIDA:
Who are you?
---
Are you looking for someone?
---
## THE STRANGER:
You know I am.
---
## ELLIDA:
What are you talking about?
---
Why do you speak to me like that?
---
Who are you looking for?
---
## THE STRANGER:
You know I'm looking for you.
---
## ELLIDA:
The eyes. 
---
## ELLIDA:
The eyes.
---
## THE STRANGER:
So you've finally recognized me?
---
I knew you at once, Ellida.
---
## ELLIDA:
The eyes.
---
Oh, don't look at me like that.
---
I'll scream for help.
---
## THE STRANGER:
Shush.
---
[shushes] There's no reason to be afraid
I'm not going to hurt you.
---
## ELLIDA:
I told you
don't look at me like that.
---
## THE STRANGER:
I came on the English steamer.
---
## ELLIDA:
What do you want with me?
---
## THE STRANGER:
I promised to come back
as soon as I could.
---
## ELLIDA:
Go, go, go away again.
---
Never come here anymore.
---
I wrote you that it was over between us.
---
Over.
You know that.
---
## THE STRANGER:
I wanted to come sooner,
but I couldn't.
---
Finally, I found a way
and so you have me Ellida.
---
## ELLIDA:
What do you want with me?
---
What are you thinking?
Why are you here?
---
## THE STRANGER:
You know why.
---
I've come to take you away.
---
## ELLIDA:
To take me away.
That's why you're here?
---
## THE STRANGER:
Of course.
---
## ELLIDA:
You know that I'm married?
---
## THE STRANGER:
Yes, I know that.
---
## ELLIDA:
Still knowing that
---
you've come to take me away?
---
## THE STRANGER:
That's what I'm doing.
---
## ELLIDA:
This is impossible.
---
[breaths heavily] It's a nightmare.
---
## THE STRANGER:
Maybe you don't wish to come?
---
## ELLIDA:
Don't look at me like that.
---
## THE STRANGER:
I'm asking
---
do you wish to come?
---
## ELLIDA:
No. No.
---
No, I won't.
I won't and I can't for as long as I live,
---
I won't. I mustn't.
---
## THE STRANGER:
All right, Ellida.
---
Let me just say one thing before I go.
---
## ELLIDA:
Don't touch me.
---
No, don't come near me. Stay there.
---
I said, don't touch me.
---
## THE STRANGER:
You must not be afraid of me, Ellida.
---
## ELLIDA:
Don't look at me like that.
---
## THE STRANGER:
Don't be afraid.
---
Don't be afraid.
---
## WANGEL:
I'm sorry I've kept you waiting.
---
## ELLIDA:
Help me, Wangel.
---
Wangel, help me, please.
---
## WANGEL:
Ellida.
---
Ellida, what's going on here?
---
## ELLIDA:
Help me.
---
Can't you see?
---
Standing right over there.
---
## WANGEL:
Who are you?
---
Why are you in my garden?
---
## THE STRANGER:
I want to talk to her.
---
## WANGEL:
What do you want with my wife?
---
Ellida, do you know this person?
---
## ELLIDA:
Do I know--? Yes.
---
## WANGEL:
Well?
---
## ELLIDA:
Yes. Wangel, it's--
---
## WANGEL:
What are you saying?
---
Are you Johnston?
---
## THE STRANGER:
Call me whatever you like.
---
That's not my name though.
---
## WANGEL:
It's not.
---
## THE STRANGER:
Not now.
---
## WANGEL:
What do you want with my wife?
---
I'm sure you know
that the lighthouse keeper's daughter
---
has been married for years,
and you know who her husband is?
---
## THE STRANGER:
I've known
for more than three years.
---
## ELLIDA:
How did you hear?
---
## THE STRANGER:
On my way home to you?
---
I happened to cross
an old newspaper from here.
---
There was a notice of your marriage.
---
## ELLIDA:
My Marriage?
---
It was like that?
---
## THE STRANGER:
I found it so strange.
---
We linked our rings.
---
That was a marriage too, Ellida.
---
## ELLIDA:
Oh.
---
## THE STRANGER:
Had you forgotten?
---
## WANGEL:
Stop this.
---
## ELLIDA:
Do not stand there
looking at me.
---
## WANGEL:
Talk to me, not to her.
---
Just tell me in a few words,
since you know this situation,
---
why are you here?
---
Why come here and seek out my wife?
---
## THE STRANGER:
I promised Ellida
I would come to her as soon as I could.
---
## WANGEL:
Ellida. Stop that.
---
## THE STRANGER:
Ellida promised faithfully
to wait for me to come.
---
## WANGEL:
She's Mrs. Wangel.
---
Please refer to her that way.
---
## THE STRANGER:
I know her as Ellida.
---
After all, she belongs to me first.
---
## WANGEL:
To you?
---
## ELLIDA:
No, no.
---
He will never let me go.
---
## WANGEL:
To you?
---
You think she belongs to you?
---
## THE STRANGER:
She's told you
about the two rings mine and Ellida's?
---
## WANGEL:
Of course. So what?
---
She broke that off
you received her letters, you know that.
---
## THE STRANGER:
Ellida and I freely agreed
that joining our rings was in every way
---
a real and binding marriage.
---
## ELLIDA:
I refuse.
---
I want nothing more to do with you.
---
Don't look at me like that.
I won't. I won't.
---
## WANGEL:
You must be out of your mind
to come here and make a claim like that
---
based upon a piece of child's play.
---
## THE STRANGER:
That's, true.
In that sense, I have no claim on her.
---
## WANGEL:
What do you want then?
---
You can't be thinking you'll take her away
by force, against her will know?
---
## THE STRANGER:
No.
Why would I do that?
---
If Ellida is to be mine,
she must come of her own free will.
---
## WANGEL:
Do you think she'll--
---
## ELLIDA:
My own free will?
---
## WANGEL:
You must be out of your mind?
---
## THE STRANGER:
I'll need to board soon so,
---
Ellida, I've kept my promise
I've kept the word I gave to you.
---
## ELLIDA:
Do not touch me.
---
## THE STRANGER:
I can give you
until tomorrow night.
---
Think it over.
---
I'll take the steamer up the fiord
and be back tomorrow night
---
I will come back then.
---
Wait here in the garden and I would prefer
to settle this with you alone.
---
You understand?
---
## ELLIDA:
No.
---
don't come back.
---
Never come back.
---
## THE STRANGER:
If by then you've decided
to come with me to sail the ocean.
---
## ELLIDA:
Don't look at me like that.
---
## THE STRANGER:
I'm only saying
we'd need to leave at once.
---
## WANGEL:
Come up to the house Ellida.
---
## ELLIDA:
I can't.
---
Wangel, help me.
---
## THE STRANGER:
You must know this,
if you do not come with me tomorrow,
---
it's over.
---
## ELLIDA:
Over forever.
---
## THE STRANGER:
Last chance.
---
I won't be returning to this country again,
Ellida, and you will never see
---
or hear from me again. Never.
---
I will be dead to you
and gone from you forever.
---
## ELLIDA:
Oh.
---
## THE STRANGER:
Think over carefully
what you will do.
---
Goodbye.
---
Ellida, prepare yourself
to begin tomorrow night.
---
I will come and take you away.
---
template: noise
strange intense sound
---
## ELLIDA:
My choice, think of it
I should go of my own free will.
---
## WANGEL:
Calm down, calm down.
It's over. Over forever.
---
## ELLIDA:
How can you say that?
---
Coming back tomorrow.
---
## WANGEL:
Let it happen.
---
I'll keep him away from you.
---
## ELLIDA:
And then after tomorrow,
gone, in the steamer over the sea--
---
## WANGEL:
What?
---
## ELLIDA:
And will never, never come back.
---
Right?
---
## WANGEL:
No, Ellida, I'm sure of that.
---
What's the point?
---
Having heard from your own lips,
you want nothing more to do with it,
---
it's over.
---
## ELLIDA:
Tomorrow then, or never.
---
## WANGEL:
Ellida. 
---
## WANGEL:
Ellida.
---
## ELLIDA:
Oh my dear. Save me from that.
---
## WANGEL:
Come, come with me.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
Mrs. Wangel.
I have something amazing to tell you.
---
## WANGEL:
What?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
You're not going to believe this.
---
We've seen the American.
---
## WANGEL:
The American?
---
## HILDA:
I saw him too.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
Walking by the back
of the garden
---
and then onto the big English steamer.
---
## WANGEL:
How do you know him?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
We were on a voyage together.
---
I thought for sure he'd drowned
but there he is larger than life.
---
I'm guessing he's come back
to get revenge on the unfaithful wife.
---
## WANGEL:
What are you saying?
---
## HILDA:
Mr. Lyngstrand is going
to make a statue of him.
---
## BOLETTE:
Come, look, the English steamer
is headed north.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
I bet he'll sneak up
on her tonight.
---
## HILDA:
On the unfaithful wife? Right.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
Probably, just at midnight.
---
## HILDA:
It's thrilling.
---
## ELLIDA:
Tomorrow then.
---
## WANGEL:
And then never again.
---
## ELLIDA:
Wangel, save me from myself.
---
## WANGEL:
Ellida.
---
I feel there's something deeper behind this?
---
## ELLIDA:
It's the pull.
---
## WANGEL:
Pull?
What do you mean?
---
## ELLIDA:
The way the sea pulls,
Like the sea?
---
template: noise
intense music
---
---
template: noise
piano playing
---
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
Must be hard to do that edging.
---
## BOLETTE:
Not hard.
You just have to count,
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
Count what?
---
## BOLETTE:
The stitches, see.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
Oh, so that's how it's done.
---
That's kind of an art.
---
Do you draw too?
---
## BOLETTE:
I can copy.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
Just copy?
---
## BOLETTE:
Yes.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
It's not really art.
---
## BOLETTE:
[laughs]
It's more like a handicraft.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
No, I imagine
you could learn to make art.
---
## BOLETTE:
Oh.
When I haven't any gift for it.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
Yes,
if you surround yourself with artists and--
---
## BOLETTE:
Oh, could I learn from them?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
Well, I don't mean learn
in that way.
---
Rather it's something
that could grow on you by degrees,
---
like a sort of miracle Miss Wangel.
---
## BOLETTE:
What a strange idea.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
Have you ever given
any thought to--
---
I mean have you ever seriously considered
marriage, Miss Wangel?
---
## BOLETTE:
No.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
I have.
---
## BOLETTE:
Have you?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
I'm always thinking
---
about things like that,
---
especially marriage.
---
I've read a lot about it too,
but how in a marriage, by some miracle,
---
the woman over time
comes to resemble the husband
---
## BOLETTE:
Acquires his interests, you mean?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
That's it.
---
## BOLETTE:
What about his abilities,
his talents, and skills?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
I suppose they too.
---
## BOLETTE:
What about learning
either from books or his own thinking?
---
Can that too be passed along
in this way to his wife?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
That too, over time,
like a miracle.
---
But only in a marriage that's faithful
and loving and very happy.
---
## BOLETTE:
Have you considered
that perhaps a husband might be absorbed
---
in the same way into his wife
and come to resemble her?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
A husband.
---
[laughs] No, I've never thought of that.
---
## BOLETTE:
Why the one and not the other?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
A man has his work to live for.
---
That's what gives him purpose
and strength Miss Wangel.
---
He has his life's work.
---
## BOLETTE:
Every single man?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
No, I was thinking
mostly of artists.
---
## BOLETTE:
Do you think it's right
for an artist to go and get married?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
Definitely.
---
Especially if he finds someone
he really loves.
---
## BOLETTE:
Oh, even then I would think
that he would rather live just for his art.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
Of course,
but he can do that even if he marries.
---
## BOLETTE:
Well, what about her then?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
Her who?
---
## BOLETTE:
The woman.
What is she to live for?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
She'd live for his art too.
---
I think a woman
would be very happy with that.
---
## BOLETTE:
I'm not so sure--
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
No, I'm sure Miss Wangel.
---
Believe me.
---
No, it's not just the sharing in his glory.
---
That's the least of it,
but she could help him to create
---
by being always at his side
and taking care of him,
---
making sure that he's comfortable.
---
Lightning his labors.
---
It seems to me that would be a great joy
for a woman.
---
## BOLETTE:
You have no idea
how selfish you are.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
Why am I selfish?
---
My God, if you knew me better.
---
Miss Wangel, when I'm gone,
---
and I will be gone soon--
---
## BOLETTE:
Empty your mind
of such sad thoughts.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
What's sad about that.
---
## BOLETTE:
What did you mean?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
I'm leaving for home
in about a month and then for the South.
---
## BOLETTE:
Oh yes. Right. Absolutely.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
Will you think of me
every now and then Miss Wangel.
---
## BOLETTE:
Oh, happily.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
That's a promise.
---
## BOLETTE:
A promise.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
Word of honor?
---
## BOLETTE:
Word of honor.
---
But let's talk about something else.
It's Mr. Arnholm.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
Are you fond of
your old teacher, Miss Bolette?
---
## BOLETTE:
Fond?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
Do you like him?
---
## BOLETTE:
[laughs] Yes.
---
He is a good friend and he's always ready
to help or give advice.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
Isn't it strange
he's never married?
---
## BOLETTE:
I guess.
---
## ARNHOLM:
Good morning, dear Bolette.
---
Good morning, Mr--
---
## BOLETTE:
Good morning, Mr. Arnholm.
---
## ARNHOLM:
How's everyone here?
---
## BOLETTE:
Good. Thank you.
---
## ARNHOLM:
Has your stepmother gone swimming?
---
## BOLETTE:
No, she's up in her room.
---
## ARNHOLM:
Not feeling well?
---
## BOLETTE:
I don't know.
---
She's locked herself in.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
Has she? Mrs. Wangel.
---
was pretty upset
about that American yesterday.
---
## ARNHOLM:
What do you know about that?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
I told her that I'd seen him
in the flesh, walking around the garden.
---
## BOLETTE:
You and father stayed up
quite late last night.
---
## ARNHOLM:
Pretty late.
We had a lot to talk about.
---
## BOLETTE:
Did you happen to talk about me?
---
## ARNHOLM:
No, Bolette, dear.
There wasn't time.
---
He got involved in other things.
---
## BOLETTE:
It's always like that.
---
## ARNHOLM:
Bolette,
we still need to have our conversation.
---
## WANGEL:
My friend you're here already.
---
I'm glad you're here so early.
---
There's a lot of things I still need
to talk to you about.
---
## BOLETTE:
Should we join Hilda
in the garden?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
I'd love nothing better,
Miss Wangel.
---
## WANGEL:
Have you had a chance
to think about what I told you last night?
---
## ARNHOLM:
How much do you know
about that young man?
---
## WANGEL:
Not much.
---
## ARNHOLM:
You don't mind that he spends
---
so much time around the girls?
---
## WANGEL:
Does he?
I hadn't noticed.
---
Tell me, have you had a chance
to think about what I told you last night?
---
## ARNHOLM:
I've thought of nothing else.
---
## WANGEL:
What do you think I should do?
---
## ARNHOLM:
How is she today?
---
## WANGEL:
Just been up to see her
and she seems on the surface calm,
---
but here's something underneath
that I just can't fathom.
---
Then she's so erratic. So elusive.
---
It's completely unpredictable.
---
## ARNHOLM:
She's in a state,
---
## WANGEL:
Not just that.
---
It's also who she is.
---
The sea is in her blood.
---
That's the problem.
---
## ARNHOLM:
What do you mean by that, Doctor?
---
## WANGEL:
Haven't you ever noticed
that the people who live their lives
---
along the open sea are ruled
by the ways of the sea?
---
As the sea surges, as it ebbs and flows,
so do their thoughts and feelings
---
and they can't survive anywhere else.
---
Should have realized this before.
---
It was a terrible crime to take Ellida
away from the sea and bring her here.
---
## ARNHOLM:
You've come to see it that way?
---
## WANGEL:
More and more,
but I should have realized it
---
at the beginning.
---
Oh, I knew it,
I just didn't want to admit it.
---
I loved her too much, you see,
so I thought only of myself.
---
I'm utterly and unforgivably selfish.
---
## ARNHOLM:
Any man would be a little selfish
in your circumstances.
---
Besides, Doctor,
I've never seen that vice in you
---
## WANGEL:
Then she got worse and worse
and now I don't know what to do.
---
That's why I turned to you
and asked you to come.
---
## ARNHOLM:
What?
---
That's why you wrote to me?
---
## WANGEL:
Yes, but don't repeat that.
---
## ARNHOLM:
Dear, Doctor.
What on earth did you think I could do?
---
I don't understand.
---
## WANGEL:
Of course not.
---
I was entirely on the wrong scent.
---
I thought you were the one Ellida cared for
and secretly yearned for,
---
and I thought it would do her good
to see you again and talk to you
---
about her home and old times.
---
## ARNHOLM:
It was your wife you meant
when you wrote that there was someone here
---
who was thinking
and perhaps longing for me.
---
## WANGEL:
Who else?
---
## ARNHOLM:
Of course. Of course.
---
I just didn't understand.
---
## WANGEL:
Of course not.
---
As I said, I was entirely
on the wrong scent.
---
## ARNHOLM:
Why do you think
the stranger has this power over her?
---
## WANGEL:
My dear friend,
there may be no rational explanation.
---
## ARNHOLM:
Unknowable.
Is that what you're saying?
---
Without reason?
---
## WANGEL:
Unknowable?
---
## ARNHOLM:
You believe in such things?
---
## WANGEL:
I never believe nor disbelieve.
---
I just don't know so I suspend judgment.
---
## ARNHOLM:
Tell me this.
The bizarre, weird thing
---
about the child's eyes.
---
## WANGEL:
I absolutely don't believe
that about the eyes.
---
I won't believe that.
She's imagined that
---
## ARNHOLM:
Yesterday,
did you get a good look
---
at the sailor's eyes?
---
## WANGEL:
Of course I did.
---
## ARNHOLM:
There was no resemblance?
---
## WANGEL:
I don't know how to answer that.
---
It was fairly dark and Ellida had put it
into my head.
---
I don't think I could be objective.
---
## ARNHOLM:
Of course not.
---
## WANGEL:
I don't know how to help her.
---
I'm at my wit's end.
I see no way forward.
---
## ARNHOLM:
Have you considered
moving someplace else,
---
somewhere she'd feel more at home?
---
## WANGEL:
You think
I haven't thought of that.
---
I've offered for us to move out
the Skioldvik. She won't.
---
## ARNHOLM:
Really?
---
## WANGEL:
No.
---
She says it'll be useless.
---
She's probably right.
---
## ARNHOLM:
You think so?
---
## WANGEL:
I do.
---
Anyway, I can't really move away.
I've got the girls to think about.
---
Wouldn't be right to move them
to some out-of-the-way corner of the earth.
---
How'd they ever find anyone to marry?
---
## ARNHOLM:
You're already thinking about that.
---
## WANGEL:
I do.
---
I have to.
---
On the one; then the other.
---
There's poor Ellida--
Everything I do is wrong.
---
## ARNHOLM:
Well, Bolette,
at least you may not have to worry about
---
for too much longer.
---
Where did she go?
Where are they?
---
## WANGEL:
I'd sacrifice anything
for any of them?
---
I just don't know what to do.
---
## ELLIDA:
Make sure you don't go out
this morning.
---
## WANGEL:
Of course not.
I'll stay home with you.
---
You haven't said good morning
to our friend.
---
## ELLIDA:
There you are.
Mr. Arnholm. Good morning.
---
## ARNHOLM:
Good morning, Mrs. Wangel.
---
Have you gone for your swim?
---
## ELLIDA:
No.
---
No, not today. 
---
Won't you sit down?
---
## ARNHOLM:
No.
---
No, thank you. Not now.
---
I promised the girls I'd meet them
in the garden.
---
## ELLIDA:
Good luck finding them
in the garden.
---
They're always wondering off.
---
## WANGEL:
Maybe down by of the pond.
---
## ARNHOLM:
I'm sure I'll find them.
---
## ELLIDA:
What time is, Wangel?
---
## WANGEL:
A little past 11:00.
---
## ELLIDA:
At 11:00 or 11:30 tonight,
the steamer will be back.
---
I wish that was over.
---
## WANGEL:
Ellida,
why didn't you immediately recognize
---
the stranger?
---
## ELLIDA:
Didn't I?
---
## WANGEL:
You told me yourself afterwards
that at first, you had no idea
---
who the stranger was.
---
## ELLIDA:
Yes, the eyes. The eyes.
---
Come and sit with me, Wangel.
I need to speak with you.
---
## WANGEL:
Go on, Ellida.
---
## ELLIDA:
It was a great shame
for both of us that you and I,
---
of all people, should find each other.
---
## WANGEL:
What are you saying?
---
## ELLIDA:
It could only lead to unhappiness,
---
especially given how we found each other.
---
## WANGEL:
What do you mean?
---
## ELLIDA:
Listen to me, Wangel.
---
It's useless to keep lying to ourselves
and to each other.
---
## WANGEL:
Is that what we're doing? Lying?
---
## ELLIDA:
Yes, lying,
---
or at least hiding the truth.
---
The truth, the sheer,
unvarnished truth is this:
---
you came out there and bought me.
---
## WANGEL:
Bought?
Why do you say bought?
---
## ELLIDA:
I'm just as must to blame.
I didn't resist.
---
I sold myself to you.
---
## WANGEL:
Ellida, how can you say that?
---
## ELLIDA:
It's what I did.
---
You had a void in your house;
you needed a new wife.
---
## WANGEL:
And a mother
for the children, Ellida.
---
## ELLIDA:
That too, perhaps.
An afterthought maybe.
---
After all, you had absolutely no idea
if I would be fit to be their mother.
---
After all, you'd only seen me and spoken
---
with me once or twice,
but I caught your eye, and so.
---
## WANGEL:
Call it what you want.
---
## ELLIDA:
There I was, sad, alone,
---
completely helpless.
---
It seemed like the most natural thing
in the world to accept the bargain
---
when you offered to keep me
for the rest of my life.
---
## WANGEL:
I assure you,
I did not think of it that way, Ellida.
---
I promise you.
---
I asked you only to share with me
and the children what little I own.
---
## ELLIDA:
You did that.
---
Whether it was a little or a lot,
I never should have agreed.
---
Not for any price.
---
I shouldn't have sold myself.
---
The filthiest work,
the worst poverty would have been better
---
if I'd chosen them of my own free will.
---
## WANGEL:
These five, six years
we've been together, for you,
---
they've been a complete waste?
---
## ELLIDA:
Oh, don't think that, Wangel.
---
You have given me everything
anyone could ask for,
---
but I didn't come into your house
of my own free will.
---
That is the problem.
---
## WANGEL:
Not of your own free will?
---
## ELLIDA:
No.
---
It was not of my own free will
that I cast my lot with yours.
---
## WANGEL:
That's the phrase from yesterday.
---
## ELLIDA:
The whole secret lies
in that phrase.
---
It's thrown new light on everything.
---
I see it now.
---
## WANGEL:
What do you see?
---
## ELLIDA:
I see that our life together
is really no marriage at all.
---
## WANGEL:
There you are right.
---
Our life together is no marriage.
---
## ELLIDA:
Nor the life before, never,
not from the beginning.
---
The first, that might have been a real
and true marriage.
---
## WANGEL:
The first?
What first do you mean?
---
## ELLIDA:
Mine with--
---
## WANGEL:
I don't understand you.
---
## ELLIDA:
My dear Wangel,
let's stop lying to ourselves
---
and to each other.
---
## WANGEL:
All right. Then what?
---
## ELLIDA:
Don't you understand.
---
We'll never get away from this
but a promise made
---
is as binding as a marriage.
---
template: overlap
## WANGEL:
What is God's name are you-- 

## ELLIDA:
Let me go, Wangel.
---
template: overlap
## WANGEL:
Ellida.

## ELLIDA:
Let me go.
---
Is there any other choice given
how we came together?
---
## WANGEL:
I've never won you over,
after all these years.
---
You've never been mine.
---
## ELLIDA:
If only I could love you,
I would and as tenderly as you deserve,
---
but I know that that cannot be.
---
## WANGEL:
A divorce then?
---
Is it a divorce, a formal, legal divorce,
---
is what you want?
---
## ELLIDA:
You really don't understand.
---
It's not a piece of paper
that I care about.
---
They mean nothing to me.
---
What I wish is for the two of us to agree,
of our own free will, to release each other.
---
## WANGEL:
To cancel the bargain.
---
## ELLIDA:
Yes, exactly.
---
To cancel the bargain.
---
## WANGEL:
Then what, Ellida, after that?
---
Have you thought of that?
What happens next?
---
What happens to us, to both of us?
---
## ELLIDA:
The future must take care of itself.
---
This, what I am right now begging you to do,
---
Wangel, this is all that matters:
set me free.
---
Give me back my freedom.
---
## WANGEL:
Ellida, this is a terrible thing
you're asking of me.
---
I need time to think.
Let's keep talking.
---
You, too, just take some time
and think this over.
---
## ELLIDA:
There's no time to waste.
---
You must give me back my freedom today.
---
## WANGEL:
Why today?
---
## ELLIDA:
Because tonight--
---
## WANGEL:
What has this stranger
to do with this?
---
## ELLIDA:
I do not want to hide
behind the fact
---
that I am another man's wife
and so I have no choice.
---
Then any decision
I made would be meaningless.
---
## WANGEL:
You talk about choice, what choice?
---
## ELLIDA:
I must be the one to choose
and choose freely.
---
I must be free to stay or to go.
---
## WANGEL:
Do you hear what you're saying?
---
Go with him?
---
Place your life into his hands?
---
## ELLIDA:
Didn't I do that with you,
and without thinking twice?
---
## WANGEL:
Maybe you did,
but a complete stranger,
---
someone you hardly know.
---
## ELLIDA:
I knew you even less
and I went with you.
---
## WANGEL:
At least, at that time,
you knew something about what kind of life
---
you'd be living, but now think.
---
What do you know now? Nothing.
---
Not even who he is, what he is.
---
## ELLIDA:
True.
---
That is what is terrifying.
---
## WANGEL:
Tell me, Ellida,
what does that mean?
---
## ELLIDA:
Something that terrifies,
it both repels and it pulls.
---
## WANGEL:
Pulls.
---
## ELLIDA:
Yes, mostly it pulls.
---
## WANGEL:
Like the sea.
---
## ELLIDA:
That pulls too.
---
## WANGEL:
As you do.
---
You both repel and pull at me.
---
## ELLIDA:
Do you think so, Wangel?
---
## WANGEL:
I see that I've never known you,
---
not really.
---
I am beginning to understand that.
---
## ELLIDA:
So set me free.
---
Untie me.
I am not the woman you thought I was.
---
You can see that now.
---
We can now part each of us
of our own free will.
---
## WANGEL:
It would be best for both of us,
I'm sure, but I can't.
---
It's you who are terrifying me, Ellida,
and you, more than anything else,
---
pull at me.
---
## ELLIDA:
Do I?
---
## WANGEL:
Let's try
and calmly get through today.
---
I can't release you and let you go today.
---
I can't for your sake, Ellida.
---
I am here to protect you.
---
## ELLIDA:
Protect me from what?
---
What do you see that is threatening me,
the terror?
---
It lies so much deeper.
It is in my mind.
---
It is how fascinated I am
by what terrifies me.
---
How can you protect me from that?
---
## WANGEL:
I can help you resist.
---
## ELLIDA:
Yes, if I had the will to resist.
---
## WANGEL:
You don't?
---
## ELLIDA:
That is just what I don't know.
---
## WANGEL:
Tonight it will be decided, Ellida?
---
## ELLIDA:
Yes, imagine.
---
The decision is near.
---
The biggest decision of my life.
---
## WANGEL:
Then comes tomorrow.
---
## ELLIDA:
Yes, tomorrow.
---
Maybe by then,
I will have given away my future.
---
## WANGEL:
Your future?
---
## ELLIDA:
A whole full life of freedom,
all just given away.
---
Maybe it's the same for--
---
## WANGEL:
Ellida, do you love this person?
---
## ELLIDA:
Do I?
---
How do I?
---
All I only know is that this terrifies me,
and that--
---
## WANGEL:
And that?
---
## ELLIDA:
I think that we belong
to each other.
---
## WANGEL:
I'm beginning to understand.
---
## ELLIDA:
What is there to say,
what's there to do, to cure me?
---
## WANGEL:
Tomorrow, the stranger
will be gone and you'll be safe
---
from making a terrible mistake.
---
I promise I will release you then
and let you go.
---
We'll cancel the bargain, Ellida.
---
## ELLIDA:
Wangel, tomrrow will be too late.
---
## WANGEL:
The children,
let's spare them for now.
---
## ARNHOLM:
We have been making plans.
---
template: overlap
## HILDA:
We want to go fishing--

## BOLETTE:
Don't say anymore.
---
## WANGEL:
We've also been making plans.
---
Ellida's going to Skioldvik tomorrow
for a while.
---
## BOLETTE:
Going away?
---
## ARNHOLM:
That's a good thing to do,
Mrs. Wangel.
---
## WANGEL:
Ellida wants to go home,
home to the sea.
---
## HILDA:
You're going?
---
You're leaving us?
---
## ELLIDA:
Hilda, what's the matter?
---
## HILDA:
Nothing.
---
Go if you want.
---
## BOLETTE:
You'll be going too,
I'm sure, father.
---
## WANGEL:
No, no, no, no, no.
I might run out there every now and then--
---
## BOLETTE:
Home again.
---
## WANGEL:
When I can.
---
## BOLETTE:
Now and then, I guess.
---
## WANGEL:
It has to be.
---
## ARNHOLM:
Bolette, we still need to have
our conversation.
---
## ELLIDA:
What's wrong with Hilda?
She seems upset.
---
## BOLETTE:
Haven't you even noticed
how Hilda keeps on looking at you
---
day after day?
---
## ELLIDA:
Why?
---
## BOLETTE:
Ever since you came here.
---
## ELLIDA:
Looking at me for what?
---
## BOLETTE:
One word of affection from you.
---
## ELLIDA:
Oh, god.
---
Maybe there is a purpose for me here.
---
## BOLETTE:
Father, dinner is on the table.
---
## WANGEL:
Is it, child?
Good. Come on, Arnholm.
---
We'll drink a parting toast to the lady
from the sea.
---
template: noise
intense music
---
## HILDA:
We can jump ashore from here.
---
## ARNHOLM:
No, no, don't do that.
---
## Lyngstand: 
God, I can't jump, Ms. Hilda.
---
## HILDA:
Can't you jump either, Mr. Arnholm?
---
## ARNHOLM:
I'd rather not.
---
## BOLETTE:
Let's dock at the steps of the bathhouse.
---
## WANGEL: 
Ellida, I promise,
you still have plenty of time.
---
## HILDA:
No, it could be any minute.
---
## BALLESTED:
Good evening, doctor.
Good evening, Mrs. Wangel.
---
## WANGEL:
You're here.
---
Is there music again tonight?
---
## BALLESTED:
The Musical Society
is going full guns.
---
Any and all occasions.
---
Tonight's in honor of the Englishmen.
---
## ELLIDA:
The English steamer.
---
Can you see it?
---
## BALLESTED:
Not yet.
---
It'll just suddenly appeared
from behind the islands,
---
like out of nowhere.
---
## ELLIDA:
Yes.
---
That's how it is.
---
## WANGEL:
This is its last trip.
---
After tonight, that'll be that.
---
## BALLESTED:
A depressing thought, Doctor,
but that's why we're all celebrating her.
---
And the joyous summertime
that is coming to an end.
---
Soon, we'll again be icebound.
---
## ELLIDA:
Icebound. Yes.
---
## BALLESTED:
Another depressing thought.
---
For weeks and months,
we've been the carefree children of summer;
---
it's hard to reconcile oneself
to the dark days ahead.
---
At first, that is, but,
people can get get used to almost anything.
---
They really can.
---
## ELLIDA:
The suspense is torture.
---
The last half hour before the decision.
---
## WANGEL:
You still insist
on seeing him alone?
---
## ELLIDA:
I must.
My choice must be of my own free will.
---
## WANGEL:
There is no choice, Ellida.
I can't let you choose--
---
I can't let that happen.
---
## ELLIDA:
You can't save me from choosing.
---
Neither you nor anyone else.
---
You can stop me from going away
if that's my choice.
---
You can hold me here against my will.
That you can do.
---
If in my heart I choose them, and not you,
if that's my choice,
---
you can't save me from that.
---
## WANGEL:
You're right.
I can't save you.
---
## ELLIDA:
I have nothing to hold me here.
---
Nothing I'm attached to or bound to.
---
I'm completely without roots
in your house, Wangel.
---
The children aren't mine--
their hearts, I mean.
---
They have never been mine.
---
When I go away, if I go away,
either tonight
---
or back to Skioldvik tomorrow,
I don't have a key to hand back,
---
or some instructions to leave behind,
nothing.
---
You see how rootless I am in your house.
---
I've stood entirely outside
of everything from the moment I arrived.
---
## WANGEL:
That was your choice.
---
## ELLIDA:
No.
---
I chose nothing, I just let everything
stay as I found it.
---
That is how you wanted it.
---
Your choice.
---
## WANGEL:
I wanted only
---
what I thought you wanted.
---
## ELLIDA:
I know that, Wangel.
---
Now for all that,
there is a price to pay.
---
Nothing holds me here,
anchors me, supports me.
---
No second-thoughts about
any special part of our lives together
---
that I would be leaving behind.
---
## WANGEL:
I can see that.
So from tomorrow, you'll be free again.
---
From then on, live your own life.
---
## ELLIDA:
You call that my own life?
---
I left that life
when I joined mine to yours.
---
Now, tonight, in half an hour,
the one I had forsaken will be back
---
to whom I was unfaithful,
and who has been so faithful to me.
---
Back to offer me, for the last time,
the chance of beginning life again,
---
of living my own real life,
a life that at the same time
---
terrifies and tempts me.
---
I can't give up that chance,
not of my own free will.
---
## WANGEL:
That's exactly why you need me,
your husband, your doctor:
---
to take this out of your hands,
and act on your behalf.
---
## ELLIDA:
I understand, Wangel.
---
Of course, there are moments,
you can be sure, when holding onto you,
---
would feel safe and give peace,
and drive away everything
---
that is terrifying and tempting,
but I can't do that.
---
I can't.
---
## WANGEL:
Come on, Ellida, let's go for a walk.
---
## ELLIDA:
I'd like to, but I mustn't.
You know I'm to stay here.
---
## WANGEL:
We still have plenty of time.
---
## ELLIDA:
You think so?
---
## WANGEL:
Lots of time. I promise.
---
## ELLIDA:
Let's walk a bit then.
---
## ARNHOLM:
Shush.
Let them go.
---
## BOLETTE:
What has been going on
between them these past couple of days?
---
If she goes home to Skiolvick tomorrow,
she's never coming back.
---
## ARNHOLM:
What makes you say that, Bolette?
---
## BOLETTE:
She won't come back.
---
At least not while Hilda and I
are in the house.
---
## ARNHOLM:
Hilda too?
---
## BOLETTE:
Well, with Hilda.
---
I know she worships Ellida,
but with me having a stepmother,
---
who's hardly older than I am--
---
## ARNHOLM:
Bolette,
it might not be that long
---
before you can get away.
---
## BOLETTE:
Do you mean that?
Have you talked to father?
---
## ARNHOLM:
I have.
---
## BOLETTE:
What did he say?
---
## ARNHOLM:
Your father has a lot
on his mind right now.
---
## BOLETTE:
That's what I said.
---
## ARNHOLM:
From what I could gather,
---
I don't think you should be counting
on any help from that quarter.
---
## BOLETTE:
No?
---
## ARNHOLM:
He explained his situation,
and how anything like that
--- 
right now is out of the question.
---
## BOLETTE:
Then why didn't you just say that?
---
Are you having fun with me?
---
## ARNHOLM:
I'm not, Bolette.
---
It's totally up to you
whether you leave home or not.
---
## BOLETTE:
Up to me?
---
## ARNHOLM:
Whether you chose to go out
---
and see the world,
---
whether you choose to learn
all that you've desired,
---
choose all that you've been longing for,
whether you chose to be happy Bolette.
---
What do you say?
---
## BOLETTE:
Oh, my God.
---
That would be wonderful,
but it's impossible.
---
If father can't or won't,
then there's no one else--
---
## ARNHOLM:
Why not let your former teacher help?
---
## BOLETTE:
You, Mr. Arnholm, you would--?
---
## ARNHOLM:
Stand by you?
---
Yes, and with the greatest of pleasure.
---
Both in word and deed;
you can count on that.
---
What do you say? You agree?
Is it a bargain?
---
## BOLETTE:
Is it a bargain?
---
To leave here and see the world,
to learn everything I want to,
---
to do everything
that has seemed impossible and wonderful.
---
## ARNHOLM:
All of that is in your reach now,
Bolette, if that's what you want.
---
## BOLETTE:
You will help me.
---
Is it right to accept such a gift
from a stranger?
---
## ARNHOLM:
You can accept it from me,
Bolette.
---
It's from me.
---
## BOLETTE:
Yes, I think I can.
---
I don't why, but I
[laughing]
I just even laugh.
---
I cry with joy.
---
I'm so happy.
---
I am going to live, after all.
---
I was beginning to feel so afraid
that life would pass me by.
---
## ARNHOLM:
There's nothing you need
to worry about, Bolette.
---
First tell me, is there anything
that holds you here?
---
## BOLETTE:
No.
I can leave whenever I want.
---
## ARNHOLM:
If that's the case, Bolette,
then I'll take you away.
---
## BOLETTE:
I can't believe it.
---
## ARNHOLM:
You trust me, don't you?
---
## BOLETTE:
Of course.
---
## ARNHOLM:
You're not afraid to put yourself
---
and your future in my hands?
---
You feel you can do that, don't you?
---
## BOLETTE:
Of course.
You're my old teacher.
---
I mean, my teacher from the old days.
---
## ARNHOLM:
No, no.
---
No, I wouldn't put too much weight there.
---
Oh.
---
Bolette, then since you are free,
there's nothing holding you,
---
I'm asking you,
---
if you'd be willing to join yourself
---
to me for life.
---
## BOLETTE:
What are you saying?
---
## ARNHOLM:
For the rest of our lives,
Bolette.
---
Will you be my wife?
---
## BOLETTE:
No, no.
---
No, no, no.
That's impossible. No.
---
## ARNHOLM:
Is it so impossible?
---
## BOLETTE:
You can't possibly mean,
Mr. Arnholm.
---
Is that what you meant when you said
you'd stand by me?
---
## ARNHOLM:
No.
Just listen a minute, Bolette.
---
I know I've shocked you.
---
## BOLETTE:
How could I not be shocked?
---
## ARNHOLM:
You're right, of course.
How could you know that the only reason
---
I'm even here is because of you.
---
## BOLETTE:
Me?
---
## ARNHOLM:
You, yes.
I got a letter from your father
---
and he wrote something
that led me to believe
---
that you'd had feelings
for your former teacher in ways
---
that were more than just as a teacher.
---
## BOLETTE:
How could father write that?
---
## ARNHOLM:
It seems now
that's not at all what he meant
---
but I got to thinking, here,
there was a young girl thinking of me,
---
longing for me.
---
## BOLETTE:
Mr. Arnholm.
---
## ARNHOLM:
Just let me talk, Bolette.
---
You see, for a man like me
no longer in his prime,
---
such a thought or delusion
---
makes a powerful impression.
---
I felt a growing vivid
and grateful affection for you.
---
I had to come here and tell you
that I shared those feelings
---
which I now see I'd imagine
that you felt for me.
---
## BOLETTE:
Now you know it was a mistake.
---
It isn't true.
---
## ARNHOLM:
It's no help, Bolette.
---
Maybe you can't understand
but that's how it is.
---
## BOLETTE:
I never in my wildest dreams.
---
## ARNHOLM:
Now that you see it
in front of you, what do you say?
---
Can you see yourself as my wife?
---
## BOLETTE:
Mr. Arnholm,
---
that's simply unthinkable.
---
## ARNHOLM:
If that's the case,
if you're so sure,
---
I stand by my promise to help you get away
and see something of the world,
---
learn all that you desire to learn,
and to help you live comfortably
---
and independently, Bolette,
and your future, too.
---
I'll take care of that.
---
You always have me as a friend to count on.
---
Know that, Bolette.
---
## BOLETTE:
It's impossible Mr. Arnholm.
---
After what you just asked me
and what I said,
---
you must know
I can't accept favors from you.
---
I can't accept anything
from you ever again.
---
## ARNHOLM:
No.
---
Would you rather stay here at home
and let life slip away?
---
## BOLETTE:
I don't want to think about that.
---
## ARNHOLM:
Will you give up
all hope of seeing the world?
---
Give up any chance
of taking your place there?
---
Can you live knowing that the world
is full of such infinite possibilities
---
and yet accepting that none of those
are for you?
---
Think on that, Bolette.
---
## BOLETTE:
I know you're right,
Mr. Arnholm, but still--
---
## ARNHOLM:
Then there's your father,
when he's no longer here,
---
will you be alone
and helpless in the world
---
or maybe will you have to give yourself
to some other man
---
for whom you may care
no more for than you care for me?
---
## BOLETTE:
I know what you say is true,
Mr. Arnholm, but--
---
Perhaps--
---
## ARNHOLM:
Answer me.
---
## BOLETTE:
Perhaps it's not as impossible
as I thought.
---
## ARNHOLM:
What isn't?
---
## BOLETTE:
It might do then to try
what you suggested.
---
## ARNHOLM:
You mean that you'd allow me
to help you as a friend?
---
## BOLETTE:
No, no.
That is impossible. No. No.
---
## ARNHOLM:
Bolette.
---
## BOLETTE:
Mr. Arnholm,
---
template: overlap
## BOLLETE:
I would rather that you--

## ARNHOLM:
Will you?
---
template: overlap
## BOLETTE:
Yes, I will.

## ARNHOLM:
Be my wife.
---
template: overlap
## BOLETTE:
Yes. If you still think
that's what you want to do.

## ARNHOLM:
If I still?
---
Thank you, Bolette.
---
Thank you.
---
All this that you've said,
your hesitations, it doesn't bother me.
---
You don't love me now.
That will come.
---
Oh, how I'll take care of you, Bolette.
---
## BOLETTE:
I will go out into the world
and take part in it.
---
You promised me that.
---
## ARNHOLM:
I have.
---
## BOLETTE:
I will learn everything I want to.
---
## ARNHOLM:
I'll teach you myself.
---
My student again as in the old days,
Bolette.
---
## BOLETTE:
To be free.
---
To go out into the world.
---
Not to worry about the future.
---
No worries about money.
---
## ARNHOLM:
That's none of your concern.
---
That's a good thing in its way.
Isn't it, Bolette?
---
## BOLETTE:
Yes.
---
I know it is.
---
## ARNHOLM:
You'll see, Bolette.
We'll live well, comfortable, happy,
---
hopeful, Bolette.
---
## BOLETTE:
Yes, I can see that.
---
I think we're going to get along very well.
---
Oh, but don't say anything more.
---
It's that poor young sculptor over there.
---
## ARNHOLM:
Oh, Lyngstrand.
What about him?
---
## BOLETTE:
You know he's ill.
---
## ARNHOLM:
Yes.
---
If it isn't all in his imagination.
---
## BOLETTE:
No, it's real.
---
He won't live long.
---
Perhaps it's a blessing.
---
## ARNHOLM:
How so?
---
## BOLETTE:
I don't think very much
would have come from his art.
---
Let's go before they see us.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
[laughs]
---
It's funny.
Everyone's in a couple now.
---
Two by two.
---
## HILDA:
Something's going on there.
---
Between them.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
You think so?
---
Have you noticed anything?
---
## HILDA:
A lot.
---
It's not too difficult if you've got eyes
in your head.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
Ms. Bolette
won't give him the time of day.
---
I'm sure of that.
---
## HILDA:
No.
---
She thinks he's really old.
---
About to go bald.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
Well, it's not just that.
---
She has other reasons.
---
## HILDA:
What do you know?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
Just there's someone else
she's promised to keep in her thoughts.
---
## HILDA:
Just that?
Keep in her thoughts?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
While he's away.
---
## HILDA:
I'm guessing that's you.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
Maybe.
---
## HILDA:
She's promised you that?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
Yes.
She promised me that.
---
Please don't tell her I told you.
---
## HILDA:
Oh, so help me God.
---
I'm as silent as a grave.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
I think it's very kind of her.
---
## HILDA:
When you come home,
will you get engaged?
---
Will you marry her?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
I doubt it.
---
It's unlikely that I'll be able
to get married.
---
At least not for a few more years.
---
I need to make my way first
and by then she'll be too old for me.
---
## HILDA:
Yet you want her to think about you.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
Yes.
That would be helpful to the artist in me.
---
## HILDA:
This, her thinking about you here
will help you get on with your group scene?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
I think so.
---
Just knowing that somewhere in the world
a young lovely woman
---
is secretly quietly dreaming of you,
that must be so--
---
I don't know what the word is.
---
## HILDA:
Thrilling?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
Yes, thrilling.
---
That's what I mean, or something like that.
---
You're very bright, Hilda.
Really, you're very bright.
---
When I come back,
you'll be just about the same age
---
your sister is now
and maybe you'll even look
---
as she looks now
and with a mind like hers too.
---
In a way, you'll be both yourself
and her in one body so to speak.
---
## HILDA:
Would you like that?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
I don't know.
---
Yes, I think so.
---
For now, for this summer,
I like you as you.
---
As just you.
Exactly as you are.
---
## HILDA:
Do you like me like this?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
Yes.
---
## HILDA:
Well, tell me, as an artist,
how do you like the way I dress?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
I like it.
---
## HILDA:
These colors look good on me?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
Very. Very tasteful.
---
My Kind of tastes.
---
## HILDA:
Tell me, as an artist,
---
how do you think I'd look in black?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
In Black?
---
## HILDA:
Yes.
---
All in black.
---
Do you think I'd look good?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
Black really isn't the thing
---
for summer,
---
but I'm sure you'd look good in black too.
I can see that.
---
## HILDA:
In black right up to the neck.
---
Black ruffle, black gloves,
a long black veil.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
You like that, Ms. Hilda?
I'd want to be a painter.
---
I'd paint such a young,
lovely heartbroken widow.
---
## HILDA:
Or a young girl mourning
for her betrothed.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
That would be even better,
---
but you can't want to dress like that.
---
## HILDA:
I don't know.
---
It could be very thrilling.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
"Thrilling".
---
## HILDA:
So thrilling to think about.
---
Yes. Look there.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
It's the English steamer.
---
Already docked.
---
## WANGEL:
I'm telling you, Ellida,
you're wrong.
---
What are you two doing here?
---
She's not here yet.
Is she, Mr. Lyngstrand?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
The English steamer?
---
## WANGEL:
What else?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
There she is, doctor.
---
## ELLIDA:
I knew it.
---
## WANGEL:
Already here.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
Snuck right in, you might say.
---
Like a thief in the night.
---
## WANGEL:
Take Hilda down to the pier. Hurry.
---
She might want to hear the music.
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
We were just going, doctor.
---
## ELLIDA:
It's come. It's here.
I feel it.
---

---
## THE STRANGER:
Good evening.
---
I have come again, as you see, Ellida.
---
Are you ready to come with me,
---
or are you not?
---
## WANGEL:
You can see for yourself she isn't.
---
## THE STRANGER:
I wasn't talking
about clothes or suitcases or any of that.
---
I have everything on board that she needs.
---
I'm asking, are you ready to come with me?
---
To come with me of your own free will?
---
## ELLIDA:
Don't ask.
---
Don't tempt me.
---
[bell rings]
---
## THE STRANGER:
That's a warning bell.
---
Now you've got to say yes or no.
---
## ELLIDA:
I have to decide.
---
To decide the rest of my life.
---
To do what can never be undone.
---
## THE STRANGER:
Never.
---
In half an hour it will be too late.
---
## ELLIDA:
What makes you want me?
---
## THE STRANGER:
Don't you feel, as I do,
that we belong to each other?
---
## ELLIDA:
Because of the promise?
---
## THE STRANGER:
Promises bind no one, no one.
---
If I want you,
it is because I have no choice.
---
## ELLIDA:
Why didn't you come sooner?
---
## WANGEL:
Ellida.
---
## ELLIDA:
This allure that tempts me,
it tugs at me, and wants to drag me
---
under into the unknown.
---
The whole might of the sea is pulling me.
---
## THE STRANGER:
I feel it,
I hear it in you, Ellida.
---
It will be me that you choose in the end.
---
## WANGEL:
My wife has no choice in this.
---
I'm here to choose for her and protect her.
---
If you don't get away from her--
---
## ELLIDA:
Wangel, I need to tell you this--
and both of you need to hear it.
---
I know you can hold me here.
---
You have that power,
and no doubt you'll use it, but my mind,
---
my thoughts, my longings, and desires,
you do not rule them.
---
They will yearn and strain out
into the unknown,
---
a world that I was created for,
and that you have kept me from.
---
## WANGEL:
I see that.
---
Step by step you're slipping away from me.
---
This craving for the unknown,
for what can never be reached,
---
it will drive your mind into darkness.
---
## ELLIDA:
Yes. Yes.
I feel it like black soundless wings
---
beating over me.
---
## WANGEL:
I can't let that happen,
---
so there's no other way
that I can see to help you:
---
so I cancel our bargain, right here.
---
Now you choose your own path,
in full, total freedom.
---
## ELLIDA:
Is that true?
---
What you say?
---
Do you mean it, with all your heart?
---
## WANGEL:
Yes.
---
With all my broken heart.
---
## ELLIDA:
You can do this?
---
You can do what you say?
---
## WANGEL:
I can, because I love you.
---
## ELLIDA:
I've grown to be so close to you.
---
## WANGEL:
The years and being together
have given us this.
---
## ELLIDA:
Why didn't I see this?
---
## WANGEL:
You had other things on your mind,
---
but now, now you're free from me.
---
Now your real life can begin again.
---
Now you choose freedom
and are responsible for yourself.
---
## ELLIDA:
Free and responsible for myself.
---
This changes everything.
---
[bell rings]
---
## THE STRANGER:
Hear that, Ellida.
---
The bells are ringing for the last time.
Let's go.
---
## ELLIDA:
I can never go with you now.
---
## THE STRANGER:
You're not coming?
---
## ELLIDA:
I can't leave you.
---
## WANGEL:
Ellida.
---
## THE STRANGER:
It's all over then?
---
## ELLIDA:
Yes, and over forever.
---
[silence]
---
You no longer have a hold over me.
---
You came out of the sea,
and now you're going back there.
---
I am no longer terrified of you,
no longer tempted.
---
## THE STRANGER:
Goodbye, then.
---
[silence]
---
From now on, in my life,
you are nothing but a long gone,
---
forgotten shipwreck.
---
## WANGEL:
Your mind is like the sea,
it ebbs and flows.
---
What made you change your mind?
---
## ELLIDA:
Everything changed
when I could choose.
---
## WANGEL:
The unknown out there,
that's no longer a temptation?
---
## ELLIDA:
It no longer terrifies nor tempts me.
---
I could have gone there,
and seen it for myself,
---
I was free to choose that,
and so I was able to reject it.
---
## WANGEL:
I'm beginning to understand,
bit by bit.
---
Now, you'll stay with me, Ellida?
---
## ELLIDA:
Yes.
---
Yes, Wangel, I will stay with you,
that is my choice,
---
and as I am responsible for myself,
I stay of my own free will.
---
## WANGEL:
We can live together
as man and wife?
---
## ELLIDA:
Yes.
---
Together, and with our two children.
---
## WANGEL:
You called them ours?
---
## ELLIDA:
They're not mine yet,
---
but I'll win them over.
---
## WANGEL:
Ours, I thank you
for that one word more than I can say.
---
## HILDA:
Look there.
---
They look like they just got engaged.
---
## BALLESTED:
It's summertime, little one.
---
## ARNHOLM:
The English steamer is on her way.
---
## BOLETTE:
You can really see her from here?
---
## LYNGSTRAND:
It's the last trip of the season.
---
## BALLESTED:
Soon, we'll be ice-bound,
and Mrs. Wangel,
---
I hear we are to lose you two for a while.
---
You're off to Skioldvick tomorrow, I'm told.
---
## WANGEL:
No, that's not happening.
---
## ELLIDA:
We've changed our minds.
---
## ARNHOLM:
Really?
---
## BOLETTE:
Is that true, father?
---
## HILDA:
You're staying with us?
---
## ELLIDA:
If you'll have me.
---
## HILDA:
How can you say that?
---
## ARNHOLM:
This is a surprise.
---
## ELLIDA:
Remember, Mr. Arnholm,
what we were saying just yesterday.
---
Once you've become a land animal,
there's no finding your way back
---
to the sea, or to the life of the sea.
