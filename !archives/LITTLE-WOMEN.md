PRE SHOW ANNOUNCEMENT

---

Welcome to Northlight Theatre and to the Orchard house. The cozy home where Louisa May Alcott wrote Little Women.

---

It was a home filled with books and plays and stories, none of which beeped or flashed or rang disruptively.

---

If you’d like to write someone a letter with pen and paper, hidden under your coat in the dark, we’ll make an exception.

---

We know Jo would’ve probably done the same.

---

But please refrain from using any more modern methods of recording or contacting the outside world during the show.

---

Or feel the wrath of fussy Aunt Marge.

---

We know you have many entertainment options, especially during the busy holiday season.

---

Thank you for choosing to spend your time here with us at Northlight. Your presence truly matters.

---

And now, welcome to Concord Massachusetts, and the world premiere adaptation of

---

Louisa May Alcott’s Little Women by Lauren Gunderson.

---

[Jaunty Fun Music]

[Music changes to soft and subtle strings]

---

[Jaunty Music Returns]

---

### LOUISA:

“Miss Alcott,” the publisher Mr. Niles says.

---

“We want you. To write. A book. “A book,” he says...

---

“for girls.” Girls? No! Whyyyy? I don’t even “like” girls.

---

Or understand them. Or know any, really, except for my sisters,

---

and they weren’t the adorable things anyone writes books about,

---

they were just normal, wild, strange, hilarious, brave, wonderful women.

---

But smaller. You want a book about that?

---

“Yes,” he says, “he does.” Especially if - and here’s the kicker - I would like to be paid.

---

Money being an annoying relic I must accept in order to pay for the aforementioned sisters. Whom I do so love.

---

Which means that… perhaps the world would too?

---

Write what you know, Miss Alcott. Or who.

---

Perhaps I could start with… Meg.

---

### MEG:

Meg enters!

---

### LOUISA / JO:

Based on my older sister Anna, the person who knows me best on earth,

---

### MEG:

[Gasp] She is gorgeous!

---

### LOUISA / JO:

the loveliest and most beautiful - and knows it.

---

### MEG:

Meg is happy to accept the rules of society that define a woman -

---

### LOUISA / JO:

except when she shoves it all off and comes back home to me -

---

### MEG:

and we dress in paper crowns and put on plays in the attic,

---

because Meg always knows how to play the part -

---

### LOUISA / JO:

which is why she will - infuriatingly - be the perfect wife one day.

---

### MEG:

You are such a troublemaker.

### LOUISA / JO:

And it is such fun.

---

Where is my Amy!?

---

### AMY:

OO LA LA AMY HAS ARRIVED!

---

### LOUISA / JO:

Based on my youngest sister May, Amy will be -

---

### AMY:

The prettiest sister with the finest clothes

---

and most adoring companions and a gobsmacking talent for painting that is unrivaled in all of New England,

---

and a life of travel and romance and -

---

you know what? Why don’t I just write it myself to make sure it’s done properly.

---

### LOUISA / JO:

Amy.

### AMY:

It’s my life!

---

### LOUISA / JO:

It’s my story, sit down.

### AMY:

I most certainly will not!

---

### LOUISA / JO:

Meg, help.

### MEG:

Of course. AMYDROPIT.

---

### AMY:

Sorry.

### LOUISA / JO:

Thank you.

---

Now! To the heart of us all. My Beth. … Beth?

---

### LOUISA / JO:

My dearest, very shy but kind-hearted sister Beth.

---

### BETH:

… hello.

---

### LOUISA / JO:

Yes, Beth shall be remimaged as…

---

actually I don’t need to change a thing about her. I think I need only be brave enough to…

---

### BETH:

to tell her story truly.

---

### JO:

To tell her story truly.

---

### MARMEE:

And what is a girls’ story without their mother,

---

### ALL SISTERS:

Marmee!

### LOUISA / JO:

the one who gave me my first fountain pen at 14 and told me -

---

### MARMEE:

“Write, my girl, and gain self-possession.”

---

### LOUISA / JO:

And so I shall. Because the only one left to write is me.

---

A girl who went by Lu instead of Louisa, a boy’s name because she always felt meant to be a boy,

---

tough and determined like a boy, who fought for her vision,

---

and freedom and self-possession like boys are told to. She is me. And I’ll call her

---

Jo. The rest I will tell as I know it. Real and bold and flawed and -

---

### MARMEE:

Loving

### AMY:

And romantic

### BETH:

And gentle

---

### MEG:

And ridiculous.

### AMY:

And romantic

---

### MARMEE:

And full of family

### BETH:

And full of music

---

### AMY:

AND ROMANCE PLEASE, LU, LET THEM END WITH HUSBANDS AND KISSING!

---

### MEG

My goodness, I feel like I’ve already read it. Are we at the beginning or the end?

---

### AMY:

The beginning of course!

### MARMEE:

Which is where, Lu?

---

### BETH:

Yes, where do we begin?

---

### LOUISA / JO:

We begin…

[Music Starts]

---

at Christmas.

---

[Music]

---

[Music stops]

### JO:

Christmas won’t be Christmas without any presents.

---

### MEG:

I know, it’s so dreadful to be poor.

---

I shouldn’t say it but -

### AMY:

It’s true!

---

I don’t think it’s fair for some girls to have plenty and other girls nothing at all.

---

### BETH:

We haven't got nothing, we’ve got Father and Mother, and each other.

---

### JO:

But we haven’t got Father, not until this war is over.

---

### BETH:

He’s not home with us, but he is in our hearts.

---

### MEG:

And I do understand why we ought not to spend money for pleasure, when our men are suffering in the army.

---

### AMY:

Yes but ughhhhh ...

### BETH:

Now we can make our little sacrifices,

---

and ought to do it gladly.

### MEG:

Well I’m not glad at all.

---

“Meg thought regretfully of all the pretty things she wanted.”

---

### AMY:

“So did Amy.”

### JO:

“Jo thought of so many new books.”

---

### BETH:

“Beth thought only of music.”

### JO:

Alright! Here’s the truth:

---

Mother didn’t say anything about using our money.

---

And I don’t think the little we would spend on ourselves would do the army any good.

---

We’ve each got a dollar, and I want to buy some new stories. A writer needs to read.

---

### AMY:

And an artist needs supplies!

---

A nice box of Faber’s drawing pencils is what I want- I Mean Need.

---

### BETH:

I wanted to spend mine on new music.

---

### MEG:

Which benefits the whole family, so it’s really not selfish at all.

---

### JO:

See? That’s it. Let’s each buy something we want and have a little fun.

---

We work hard enough to earn it.

---

### MEG:

I know I do—teaching those tiresome children all day.

---

### JO:

Oh you don’t have half so hard time as I do

---

shut up for hours with fussy Aunt March.

---

### BETH:

It’s terrible of me but I do think keeping things tidy is the worst work in the world.

---

My hands get stiff, and I can’t practice.

---

### AMY:

I don’t believe any of you suffer as I do.

---

You don’t have to go to school with impertinent girls, who laugh at your dresses,

---

and call your father poor, and insult your nose.

---

### JO:

If they insult you again, you come to me, I’m the man of this house.

---

### MEG:

Don’t say that, Jo! You are not! it’s so boyish!

### JO:

That’s why I do it.

---

### AMY:

I detest unladylike girls.

### JO:

And I hate affected niminy piminy little chits

---

### MEG:

STOP. You are old enough to behave better, Josephine, you’re a young lady.

---

### BETH:

HA. Alright now, everyone.

### JO:

No I’m not and never will be.

---

I can’t get over my disappointment in not being a boy.

---

### AMY:

Well some of us need to impress upon the world our feminine deck-o-rum.

### Jo:

Decorum.

---

### MEG:

Oh hush Amy, you are altogether too prim

---

and if you won’t be warned you’ll grow up an fussy little goose.

---

### BETH:

If Jo is a tomboy and Amy a goose, what am I?

---

### SISTERS OVERLAPPING:

You’re a dear and nothing else. You are perfect, my love! Beth is the very best of us!

---

### BETH:

“The clock struck six and the girls realized how much of the day was lost to their complaining.”

---

### JO:

Oh my goodness, there is still so much to do about our play for Christmas night.

---

### MEG:

No No No, I’m getting too old for such things.

---

[Sisters Complain]

### JO:

You are the best actress we’ve got

---

and there'll be an end to everything if you quit the boards.

---

### JO:

Meg, Please

### AMY:

Fine fine fine, once more for Christmas and then we’ll see.

---

### JO:

“Being still too young and too poor to afford the theatre -

---

the girls made whatever they needed to produce their own plays.”

---

### BETH:

“Beth accompanied them on the piano,”

---

### MEG:

“Meg performed masterfully,”

---

### AMY:

“Amy fainted on cue!”

---

### JO:

“and Jo played all the male parts to her heart’s content, having written all the roles herself.”

---

### BETH:

I don’t see how you can write and act such splendid things, Jo.

---

You’re a regular Shakespeare.

---

### JO:

You know I would like to try Macbeth one day.

---

### MEG:

Macbeth for Christmas?!

---

### JO:

I always wanted to do the killing part.

### BETH:

Oh my word. I’d see that. Oh goodness.

---

### JO:

Is this a dagger I see before me?!

### MEG:

No, it’s a fork! Get thee to dinner at once!

---

[The sisters pretend to fight and made silly gurgling and dying sounds to play the part]

---

### MARMEE:

I could hear you from across the yard, my girls!

---

[Sisters talk over each other to greet Marmee]

---

### MARMEE:

Yes Yes Yes, how are we all faring, and what trouble has Jo gotten you into?

---

[Sisters talk all at once]

---

### MARMEE:

GIRLS!

---

As I said, there will be no presents for ourselves this year.

---

Except for one. I’ve got a treat for you this Christmas Eve.

---

[Sisters cheer excitedly]

### Amy:

A letter?

---

### MARMEE:

Yes Yes Yes, if you might calm yourselves long enough to hear it.

---

### JO:

I’m so calm!

### BETH:

Does it say when he will come home?

---

### MARMEE:

No. But we can’t ask for him back before he can be spared. Now come and hear. Come Come.

---

[Soft music plays]

### MEG:

“So they all drew to the fire, “

---

### BETH:

“Mother in the big chair with Beth at her feet,”

---

### AMY:

“Meg and Amy perched on either arm of the chair “

---

### MARMEE:

“and Jo leaning on the back,”

---

### JO:

“where no one would see any sign of emotion if the letter should happen to be touching.”

---

### MARMEE:

He says…‘Give them all my love and a kiss.

---

Tell them I think of them by day, pray for them by night,

---

and find my best comfort in their affection at all times.

---

A year seems very long to wait, but I know they will be loving children to you,

---

will do their duty faithfully, and that when I come back to them I may be prouder than ever of my little women.’

---

### JO:

I’m such a selfish pig!

### BETH:

We’re complaining while he’s fighting in misery.

---

### AMY:

I’ll try to be better, I truly will.

### MEG:

As will I!

---

I think too much of my looks and hate to work.

---

### BETH:

I promise I won’t envy girls with nice pianos.

---

### JO:

I’ll try not to be so rough and wild and Macbeth.

---

### MARMEE:

Girls girls, you are good and generous and honest and wouldn’t that please your father?

---

As would my next proposal. It’s a big one.

---

[Sisters talk over each other excitedly]

### MARMEE:

Alright.

---

Not far away from here lives a poor woman with a little newborn baby.

---

Six children are huddled into one bed and there is nothing to eat.

---

Will you give them your breakfast tomorrow for Christmas?

---

It's not much, but we can do without, can’t we?

---

### SISTERS OVERLAPPING:

Yes of course we will!

That’s so sad. We must!

And bring blankets! And mittens! And extra flour?

---

### MARMEE:

I knew it, I knew you would help, thank you, girls, thank you.

---

### AMY:

But are we giving them the whole breakfast or just the muffins.

---

### SISTERS OVERLAPPING:

Quiet Amy. It’s Christmas.

SHHHH.

I’m hungry!

---

[Music Returns]

### MARMEE:

“And early the next morning

---

the procession set out hauling baskets and blankets across the snow to the Hummel’s home.”

---

### BETH:

“A poor, bare, miserable room it was,”

---

### AMY:

“with broken windows, no fire, ragged clothes,”

---

### MEG:

“a sick mother, wailing baby, and hungry children trying to keep warm.”

---

### JO:

“Marmee gave the mother tea and comforted her.”

---

### BETH:

“The girls spread the table “

### AMY:

“and fed the children like so many hungry birds.”

---

### JO:

“It was a very happy breakfast. Though they didn’t eat a thing.”

---

### MEG:

“And returning home the March women stopped at the sight of their dining room table. “

---

### BETH:

“Which was surprisingly… full?”

[Sisters talk over each other excitedly]

---

### JO:

“There was bread and cake and fruit and distracting French bonbons

---

### AMY:

and four great bouquets of flowers.”

### JO:

Who did this?

---

### AMY:

Is it fairies?

### BETH:

Or Santa!

---

### MEG:

Mother did it, didn’t you?

---

### MARMEE:

No, It seems it was Mr. Laurence.

---

### AMY:

Mr. Laurence.

---

### JO:

That old grandfather?

### BETH:

From the big house next door?

---

### AMY:

It’s a house full of men isn’t it?

### MEG:

And we don’t know them.

---

What in the world put such a thing into his head?

---

### MARMEE:

The note says that he saw our breakfast party to the Hummels and

---

‘hoped I would allow him to express his friendly feeling toward my children.’

---

### JO:

I bet that boy put it into his head,

---

he always looks out that window as if he’d like to know us.

---

He obviously needs some fun in his life.

---

### MEG:

Jo, don’t make trouble.

---

### JO:

I’m making friends! Boys need friends.

---

### MEG:

With other boys.

### JO:

Details for another day.

---

### MARMEE:

It’s all so terribly kind of them.

### BETH:

It is, it truly is.

---

### AMY:

Play something for them, Beth, and loudly.

---

### JO:

Yes! Then those Laurence men are sure to hear our thanks.

---

### MEG:

Yes let’s sing!

### JO:

Something for Christmas!

---

### MARMEE:

“No one but Beth could get much music out of the old piano, but they made do.”

---

### JO:

“They always did.”

---

[Beth plays the old piano and they all sing “Hark, the Herald Angels Sing.” ]

---

[The girls singing fades away, until only a mans voice remains singing the chorus]

---

[Singing Stops]

### MEG:

Is my sash right?

---

My hair looks bad doesn’t it? It does, I hate it!

---

### JO:

No it doesn’t, you can’t even tell I burnt it.

---

### MEG:

Well I can’t see it, but everyone else will! Can you still smell it?

---

### JO:

Nooo-

[She takes a big sniff of Meg’s Hair]

---

Uhh Nope. And you cannot help but look beautiful. Also a party is supposed to be fun.

---

### MEG:

Not for girls.

[Jo Groans]

---

Now please try to be proper, at least for tonight. It’s a wonder we were invited at all.

---

### JO:

Well if you see me doing anything wrong, just wink.

---

### MEG:

Winking isn’t ladylike, no winking! Just keep your shoulder straight,

---

take short steps not your giant strides, and don’t shake hands, it isn’t the thing.

---

### JO:

Got it, I think.

### MEG:

Don’t think, just smile.

---

### JO:

Then let us be elegant or die.

---

“And down they went."

### MEG:

[Music plays]

“And down they went!

---

Feeling timid for they seldom went to parties.”

---

### JO:

“Meg was at her ease very soon, but Jo felt as out of place as a colt in a flower garden.”

---

### MEG:

“Then the dancing began and Meg was asked at once.”

---

### JO:

Of course she was.

---

“And then Jo saw a big red headed youth approaching and fearing he meant to ask her to dance,

---

Jo leapt behind a curtain and into the next room where she found herself face to face with -”

---

### LAURIE:

“The Laurence boy.”

---

### JO:

“The Laurence boy.”

---

### LAURIE:

“And the March girl.”

### JO:

“The March girl.”

---

### LAURIE:

Hello.

### JO:

Hello! …

---

I didn’t know anyone was here.

---

### LAURIE:

Anyone is. I mean I am, I mean hello, stay if you like, or not.

---

I only came here because I don’t know many people and felt rather strange out there so… I hid.

---

### JO:

So did I! Both of us. Taking refuge.

---

### LAURIE:

Oh, I can leave if you prefer -

### JO:

No don’t go away! Unless you’d rather.

---

### LAURIE:

No! I’d much rather stay. Here.

### JO:

Then here… we are.

---

### JO:

I think I’ve had the pleasure of seeing you before. You live near us, don’t you?

---

### LAURIE:

Next door, Miss March, yes. Big house.

### JO:

I thought so.

---

We did have such a good time over your delicious Christmas present, Mr. Laurence,

---

thank you again. And I’m not “Miss March,” I’m only Jo.

---

### LAURIE:

I’m only Laurie. Well, Theodore, but I don’t like it.

---

### JO:

I hate my name too, Josephine is so sentimental!

---

I wish everyone would say Jo. How did you get everyone to stop calling you Theodore?

---

### LAURIE:

I thrashed them.

---

### JO:

Well I can’t thrash Aunt March. So I’ll have to bear it.

[They share a laugh]

---

### LAURIE:

Do you… like to dance, Miss Jo?

---

### JO:

Oh! Well, if there is plenty of room. In a place like this I’m sure to topple something,

---

so I let Meg sail about instead. She’s my sister. Don’t you dance?

---

### LAURIE:

Sometimes. But I’ve been abroad a good many years,

---

and don’t know how you do things here.

### JO:

Abroad! Oh, tell me!

---

I love to hear people describe their travels. Germany? England? Did you go to Paris?

---

### LAURIE:

[With a bad french accent]

Oui, We spent last winter there.

---

### JO:

[Laughing]
Well that is just fantastic.

### LAURIE:

It… is.

---

“Laurie’s bashfulness soon wore off - “

### JO:

“for Jo’s gentlemanly demeanor - “

---

### LAURIE:

“and eager questions set him at ease. “

---

### JO:

“She liked the ‘Laurence boy’ - “

---

### LAURIE:

[teasing]

“and took several good looks at him,”

---

### JO:

[defensive]

“so that she might describe him"

---

### LAURIE:

[teasing]

“several good looks”

---

### JO:

[defensive]

“might describe him to her sisters, as boys were almost unknown creatures to them.”

---

### LAURIE:

Uh huh.

“He wondered what she thought of him.”

---

### JO:

[To herself]

“Handsome nose, fine teeth, polite for a boy, and altogether jolly.”

---

### LAURIE:

“Isn’t she the most interesting girl...”

### JO:

“Isn’t he the most curious boy…”

---

### JO:

“Jo wanted very much to ask him… everything. “

---

### LAURIE:

“Instead she shouted - “

### JO:

Polka!

---

It just started. Why don’t you go and dance with someone, Mr. Laurie of the Big House?

---

### LAURIE:

If you come I will. There’s a hall out there, no one will see us.

---

We can dance as we like. Please.

---

### JO:

“And Jo went. Gladly.”

---

### LAURIE:

“And they had a grand polka.

---

And when the music stopped“

---

### JO:

“They paused to get their breath - “

---

### LAURIE:

“and Laurie was… Laurie was…”

---

### MEG:

“ - surprised when Meg appeared holding her foot.”

---

JO, I’m hurt!

### JO:

Meg?! Oh no, what happened?

---

### MEG:

That stupid high heel. I’ve sprained my ankle. I can hardly stand,

---

I don’t know how I’m ever going to get home.

---

### JO:

I knew you’d hurt your feet with those silly shoes.

---

### MEG:

Jo, don’t mock me now.

### JO:

I can get a carriage somehow.

---

### MEG:

We can’t have a carriage, it costs so much.

---

### LAURIE:

Use mine. Please.

### MEG:

Thank you, no, we couldn't.

---

[to Jo]

Who is he?

---

### LAURIE:

I’m Laurie, you’re hurt. My grandfather’s carriage just arrived and it happens to be going exactly your way.

---

### JO:

His way is our way.

### LAURIE:

Your way is my way.

---

### MEG:

What are you talking about?

### LAURIE:

I live across from you.

---

### MEG:

You’re the Laurence boy?

---

### JO:

That he is.

### LAURIE:

That I am.

---

Please, let me take you home. I insist.

---

### MEG:

Oh well… Yes thank you, thank you so much, Mr. Laurence -

---

### LAURIE & JO:

It’s just Laurie.

---

### JO:

[Sound of Carraige Rolling]
“And soon the girls rolled away in the luxurious carriage,

---

feeling very elegant. Laurie rode on the box so Meg could keep her foot up.”

---

### MEG:

Which was very polite of him.

---

### JO:

Wasn't it.

### LAURIE:

Wasn’t it.

---

[Carraige Stops]

### MEG:

And soon they were home, safe and sound.

---

### JO:

Thank you again and again.

---

### MEG:

And good night.

---

### JO:

And good night! To you, new friend.

---

### LAURIE:

And to you. New friend.

---

[Meg clears her throat loudly.]

---

[Jo and Meg glance and scoff at each other, having an entire conversation without words]

---

[The sisters talk over each other with questions about the party]

---

### JO:

Shhhh you’ll wake up Marmee. We’ll tell you in the morning, you goose. Everyone to bed this instant.

---

### JO:

“The garden separated the Marches from the Laurences.”

---

“On one side was an old, brown house, looking rather shabby.”

---

“On the other side was a stately stone mansion - “

---

“Yet it seemed a lonely, lifeless sort of place,”

---

“no mother, few people, except the old gentleman, his grandson,” (John enters on his was to work)

---

### MEG & JOHN

“and the boy’s tutor.”

---

### JOHN:

Good day, Miss March.

---

### MEG:

Good day, sir.

---

---

### MEG:

Did you see him? He knew my name. How did he know I was “Miss March”?

---

### JO:

We’re all “Miss March” in this house, calm down.

---

### JO:

“Since the party, Jo had been more eager than ever to know the Laurence boy, “

---

### AMY:

“but he had not been seen lately,”

### BETH:

“ and Jo began to think he had gone away,”

---

### JO:

“when she spied a face at an upper window -

---

“LAURIE! How do you do? Are you sick?

---

### LAURIE:

Better, thank you. I’ve had a bad cold, been shut up a week.

---

### JO:

I’m sorry. Isn’t there some nice, quiet girl who’d come over and amuse you?

---

### LAURIE:

Don’t know any.

---

### JO:

Which is why you have me! And here I come!

---

### LAURIE:

Oh, no, you needn’t come up!

---

### JO:

“But she did, startling the servants, waltzing into Laurie's little parlor,”

---

### LAURIE:

“and giving quite a different air to the room.”

---

### JO:

Hello you! My word, someone needs to let some light in. Shall I read aloud or - ?

---

### LAURIE:

Or we could talk, if you don’t mind, I’d rather talk.

---

### JO:

I’ll talk all day if you’ll only set me going. Beth says I never know when to stop.

---

### LAURIE:

Is Beth the rosy one, who stays at home?

---

### JO:

Yes, she’s my girl, and a regular good one, too.

---

### LAURIE:

And the pretty one is Meg, I remember. And the curly-haired one is Amy, I believe?

---

### JO:

Yes indeed, how did you find that out?

---

### LAURIE:

Oh, I often hear you calling to one another,

---

and I can’t help looking over at your house, you always seem to be having such good times.

---

And I beg your pardon for being so rude,

---

but sometimes you forget to put down the curtain at the window where the flowers are.

---

It’s like looking at a picture to see you all with your mother.

---

I haven’t got one, you know. Anyhow, I apologize.

---

### JO:

“The solitary, hungry look in his eyes went straight to Jo’s heart.”

---

We’ll never draw that curtain again. I just wish you’d come over. Beth has kittens!

---

### LAURIE:

Well, one cannot refuse a kitten.

[The pair laugh, and Jo lets out a snort]

---

### JO:

“She let herself look away.”

### LAURIE:

“While he looked at her. “

---

### JO:

Do you read as well? I read constantly! And write - I’m a writer -

---

just a handful of stories so far but I am diligent about filling up a whole book one day.

---

### LAURIE:

Then you must come and see—

### LAURIE & JO:

the library.

---

### JO:

“Which was lined with so many books, and statues, and cabinets full of curiosities,”

---

### LAURIE:

“And a great grand piano.”

---

### JO:

What richness! Theodore Laurence, you ought to be the happiest boy in the world.

---

### LAURIE:

Well. A fellow can’t live on books alone.

---

### JO:

I can. My goodness! Do you play this piano or just look at it?

---

### LAURIE:

Sometimes I play, but Grandfather doesn’t like to hear me.

---

### JO:

Why not? I would! Oh do play please, so I can tell Beth. And I love music.

---

### LAURIE:

Alright. For you.

---

### JO:

“So Laurie played

### LAURIE:

and Jo listened.

---

### JO:

And her respect and regard for the boy increased. Very much.”

---

### LAURIE:

“All sorts of pleasant things happened about that time,

---

### JO:

“for the new friendship flourished like grass in spring.”

---

### AMY:

“Every one liked Laurie, “

---

### JOHN:

“and he privately informed his tutor Mr. Brooke that the Marches were quite splendid girls.”

---

### MEG:

Did he?

### LAURIE & JOHN:

He did.

---

### JOHN:

Miss March.

### MEG:

Mr. Brooke.

---

---

### JO:

Aaaand that’s enough of that.

---

### MARMEE:

“What good times they had, “

### BETH:

“Such plays and tableaux,”

---

### MEG:

“ such sleigh rides and frolics, “

---

### AMY:

“such pleasant evenings in the parlor, copying pictures and enjoying the beautiful art “

---

### LAURIE:

“while Laurie played ‘lord of the manor.’”

---

### BETH:

“But Beth, though yearning for the grand piano Jo told her about,

---

could not pluck up the courage to go.”

---

### MARMEE:

Beth, darling, Mr. Laurence said that you are most welcome,

---

and the piano needs to be kept in tune by someone.

---

### JO:

That someone is you!

---

### BETH:

Well. Perhaps. If he is quite sure nobody would hear me or be disturbed.

---

### JO:

They won’t, the house is empty half the day.

---

And he’s not a scary old man, he said he’d be obliged if you would come.

---

### MARMEE:

“So the next day, Beth, “

### BETH:

“after two or three retreats,”

---

### AMY:

“made her way as noiselessly as any mouse to where the piano stood.”

---

### MEG:

“and with trembling fingers”

### JO:

“at last touched the great instrument,”

---

[Piano plays]

### BETH:

“and straightway forgot her fear, herself,

---

and everything else but the unspeakable delight which the music gave her, for it was like the voice of a beloved friend.”

---

### MARMEE:

“And she never knew that Mr. Laurence opened his study door to hear.”

---

### LAURIE:

“And never saw Laurie guard the hall to keep the servants away.”

---

### JO:

“And never suspected that the new music she found waiting there every day after was put there for her.”

---

### BETH:

Mother, I’m going to work Mr. Laurence a pair of slippers. He is so kind to me, and I - I - I must thank him somehow.

---

### MARMEE:

Oh yes, I think that will please him very much.

---

### BETH:

You do? Good. Alright then.

---

### JO:

“So Beth worked hard and finished them quickly -”

### AMY:

“Then wrote a short note,”

---

### LAURIE:

“and with Laurie’s help got them smuggled in before the old gentleman was up.”

---

### BETH:

“And Beth waited. And waited.

---

And wondered if she had done something wrong in sending them.”

---

### MARMEE:

“But days later there was quite a stir at the March house,

---

for suddenly there in the old parlor stood - “

---

### BETH:

“a beautiful cabinet piano!”

---

### MARMEE:

“With a note that says 'to Miss Elizabeth March.'”

---

### BETH:

From Mr. Laurence?

### JO:

It must be!

---

Isn’t it splendid of him?

---

### BETH:

I can’t, no, it’s too much!

---

[The Sisters talk over each other in disagreement]

### AMY:

The letter, what does it say?

---

### MARMEE:

It says “Dear Madam—”

---

### AMY:

Ugh I wish someone would write madam to me.

### JO & BETH & MEG:

SHHHHHH

---

### MARMEE:

‘I have had many pairs of slippers in my life,

---

but I never had any that suited me so well as yours, which will always remind me of the gentle giver.

---

I like to pay my debts, so I know you will allow ‘the old gentleman’ to send you something

---

which once belonged to the little granddaughter he lost.

---

With hearty thanks and best wishes, I remain Your grateful friend and humble servant, James Laurence.’

---

---

### BETH:

What a gift.

---

### JO:

You’ve given him back his granddaughter. The sound of her at least. What a gift to him.

---

---

[Meg Plays]

---

### MEG:

He is so kind to invite us.

### JO:

I cannot wait to see the daggers.

---

### AMY:

Wait Wait Wait, where are you going now?

---

### JO:

Not your concern. Little girls shouldn’t ask questions.

---

### MEG:

“Now if there is anything mortifying to our feelings when we are young, it is to be told that.”

---

### AMY:

You are going somewhere with Laurie, I know you are.

---

You were whispering and laughing together on the sofa last night,

---

and you stopped when I came in. Aren’t you going with him?

---

### JO:

Yes we are, to the theatre, now stop bothering us.

---

### AMY:

To the theatre?! I want to go.

### JO:

You can’t go.

---

### AMY:

Yes I can!

---

### JO:

You can go with Beth and Marmee but not us.

---

### AMY:

I don’t like that half as well as going with you and Laurie. Please, I’m dying for some fun.

---

### JO:

NO.

### AMY:

WHY?!

---

Meg, please! I’ll be ever so good.

---

### MEG:

Suppose we do take her -

### JO:

NO.

---

If she goes I shan’t, and if I don’t, Laurie won’t like it, and it will be very rude after he invited only us -

---

### AMY:

Meg says I may, and if I pay for myself Laurie hasn’t anything to do with it.

---

### JO:

Our seats are reserved and that isn’t proper when you weren’t asked.

---

### MEG:

Jo.

### JO:

Meg!

---

### AMY:

Please!

### JO:

NO.

---

### AMY:

[Shouting loudly and angrily]
“Sitting on the floor with one boot on, Amy began to cry.”

---

### LAURIE:

Hello, Ladies?

---

### JO:

Just a moment, Laurie!

### MEG:

Coming!

---

### JO:

“And just as the party was setting out,”

---

### BETH:

“Amy called over the banisters”

---

### AMY:

You’ll be sorry for this, Jo March!

[Amy blows a raspberry]

---

### LAURIE:

“They had a charming time,”

### MEG:

They did.

---

### JO:

“but Jo’s pleasure had a drop of bitterness in it.”

---

### MEG:

“She and Amy had had many lively skirmishes,”

### LAURIE:

“for both had quick tempers.”

---

### JO:

“Amy teased Jo,”

### MEG:

“and Jo irritated Amy,”

---

### LAURIE:

“and semioccasional explosions occurred.”

---

### JO:

What a tremendous play, Teddy, thank you! Now for tomorrow, are we skating, climbing or hiking?

---

### LAURIE:

I think… all of it?

### JO:

That’s my boy. Bring a book.

---

### LAURIE:

I’ll bring three. Goodnight!

### JO:

Goodnight!

---

### MEG:

Goodnight, Laurie, thank you for the lovely time.

---

### BETH:

“When they got home, they found Amy reading in the parlor,”

---

### JO:

“never lifting her eyes from her book.”

---

### MEG:

Good evening.

---

### AMY:

MmHmm.

---

### JO:

And good night.

---

### AMY:

MmHmm.

---

### BETH:

“Jo’s first look was toward the bureau,”

---

### JO:

The stories I was writing, the fairy stories, where is it? Has anyone seen my book?

---

### MEG:

“Jo’s book was the pride of her heart,”

---

### BETH:

“And she hoped to one day make something good enough to print.”

---

### JO:

Where is my book?

---

### MEG:

“Amy poked the fire ”

---

### BETH:

“and said nothing.”

---

### JO:

You’ve got it. I know it.

### AMY:

No, I haven’t.

---

### JO:

You know where it is, then

---

### AMY:

I haven’t got it, don’t know where it is, and don’t care.

---

### JO:

You know something about it, and you’d better tell me at once,

---

or I’ll make you.

### AMY:

Scold as much as you like

---

but you’ll never see your silly old book again because I burned it.

---

### JO:

You What?

### MEG:

No Nonononononono

### BETH:

Amy, you didn't

---

### JO:

WHAT DID YOU DO to my book?

### BETH:

Why would you do that?

---

### JO:

WHen I meant to finish it before father got home?

### MEG:

She was working on it for ages!

---

### JO:

HOW COULD YOU?

### AMY:

I told you I’d make you pay, and so I have!

---

### JO:

By destroying my stories! You wicked, wicked girl,

---

I can’t write it again, and I’ll never forgive you as long as I live!

---

### MARMEE:

“It was not a happy evening.”

---

### BETH:

“And bitter cold in the morning.”

---

### MARMEE:

Jo, my dear, don’t let the sun go down upon your anger.

---

Forgive each other, help each other, and begin again -

---

### JO:

I can’t. It was an abominable thing, and she -

---

### AMY:

Please. Forgive me, Jo. I’m very, very sorry.

---

### JO:

…Never.

---

### BETH, MEG, & MARMEE:

Jo....

### AMY:

I said I was sorry!

---

### JO:

Everyone is so hateful, I’m going skating with Laurie.

---

### AMY:

But she promised I should go next time. It’s the last ice we’ll have and she said so!

---

### JO:

“But Jo didn’t look back.”

---

### MEG:

She’ll come around, just don’t say anything till Jo gets good-natured with Laurie, then do some kind thing.

---

### BETH:

Yes I’m sure she’ll be friends again if you try her at the right minute.

---

### AMY:

Right. Good. Yes, I will.

---

### MARMEE:

“And after a flurry to get ready,”

---

### AMY:

“Amy panted and ran after Laurie and Jo who were just disappearing over the hill.”

---

### JO:

“Jo heard Amy but skated down the river,

---

taking a bitter sort of satisfaction in her sister’s troubles.”

---

### LAURIE:

Keep near the shore. It isn’t safe in the middle.

---

### JO:

“Which made Jo stop with a strange feeling in her heart,”

---

### LAURIE:

“and something turned her round,”

### JO:

“just in time to see Amy throw up her hands”

---

### AMY:

JO!

### LAURIE:

“and go under.”

### JO:

AMY!!!

---

### LAURIE

“with a crash of ice,”

### JO:

“the splash of water,”

---

### LAURIE:

“and a cry that -

### JO:

“made Jo’s heart still”

---

### LAURIE:

“She saw -”

### JO:

“Her sister -”

### ALL:

“Sink.”

---

### JO:

AMY!

### AMY:

LAURIE!

### LAURIE:

GET HER!

---

### JO:

“For the next few minutes she worked as if possessed,

---

blindly obeying Laurie, who held Amy up by his hockey stick till they got her out,

---

shivering, dripping, crying, Laurie’s coat around her.”

---

### MEG:

“Jo’s dress torn - “

### BETH:

“ her hands cut by the ice.”

---

### LAURIE:

“But they were all safe.”

---

### ALL BUT LAURIE:

Thank you!

### LAURIE:

Of course. Are you alright, Jo?

---

### JO:

Don’t worry about me, just get her warm and dry.

---

### BETH:

Come with us, Amy. Let’s get you warm.

---

### MARMEE:

Jo, darling, calm down. She is not hurt and won’t even take cold I think.

---

You did the right thing and quickly.

---

### JO:

Not me, Laurie did it all. I didn’t wait for her, I let her go.

---

Mother, if she should die, it would be my fault.

---

### MARMEE:

No No No No my dear.

### JO:

Yes, I could have lost her.

---

We all could have lost her because of my dreadful temper,

---

I try to cure it, I think I have, and then I get so savage.

---

### MARMEE:

You think your temper is the worst in the world? Mine used to be just like it.

---

### JO:

Your temper? You’re never angry.

---

### MARMEE:

Jo, I am angry nearly every day of my life, but I just learned not to show it.

---

### JO:

How? I’m so afraid… so afraid that I’ll do something dreadful one day.

---

### MARMEE:

Then you will do what I do.

---

I’ve learned to check my hasty words when they mean to break out against my will.

---

I just go away for a minute, give myself a little shake,

---

and try to practice all the virtues I would have my girls possess.

---

It’s easier to try for your sakes than for my own.

---

### JO:

Oh, Mother, if I’m ever half as good as you.

---

### MARMEE:

I hope you will be a great deal better. You have had a warning today. Remember it. Forgive.

---

### JO:

Yes. I will.

---

If it hadn’t been for Laurie…
[Marmee Shushes Jo]

---

### JO:

“And the sincerest prayer Jo had ever prayed left her heart without words.”

---

### AMY:

Jo?

---

### LAURIE:

Welcome to Camp Laurence!

---

Brooke is commander in chief, I am commissary general, and you, ladies, are company.

---

Now, let’s have a game before it gets hot, and then some food!

---

### JOHN:

“Croquet was the game and Mr. Brooke chose Meg for his team.“

---

### LAURIE:

“Laurie chose Jo, of course.“

---

### AMY:

“Amy and Beth watched - “

### BETH:

“and cheered for both sides!”

---

### MEG:

“Team Brooke played well -“
[Team Laurence Boos]

---

### LAURIE:

“But Team Laurence played better.”

### JO:

I got this.

---

[Beth and Amy cheer on Jo excitedly]

---

[Jo scores, and the crowd goes wild!]

---

### MEG:

Good game, then, both of you.

---

### JO:

No hard feelings of course. Just more talent.

---

### MEG:

Jo.

### LAURIE:

HA.

---

### JOHN:

No No, they won fair and square. Well done, Team Laurence.

---

### LAURIE:

Looks like I chose right, Brooke. Better luck next time.

---

### JOHN:

I’m quite happy with my team, thank you. A pleasure, Miss March.

---

### MEG:

Indeed.

---

### JO:

Let’s lunch!

---

### BETH:

“Mr. Brooke was a grave, silent young man,”

---

### MEG:

“with handsome eyes. Meg liked his quiet manners and considered him a walking encyclopedia.”

---

### JOHN:

“He never talked to her much,”

### JO:

Good.

---

### JOHN:

“but he looked at her often,”

### JO:

Not good.

---

### MEG:

Leave it, Jo.

---

### LAURIE:

“So while Mr. Brooke lay on the grass with a book he turned to Meg and said - “

---

### JOHN:

I shall be very sorry to lose Laurie as a pupil next year.

---

### MEG:

He’ll be going to college, I suppose?

---

### BETH:

“Meg’s lips asked the question,”

### AMY:

“but her eyes added,”

---

### MEG:

“And what becomes of you?”

---


### JOHN:

When Laurie has no further need of me, I shall turn soldier.

---

### MEG:

I should think every young man would want to go,

---

though it is hard for the mothers and sisters at home.

---

### JOHN:

I have neither, and very few who care what becomes of me.

### MEG:

I do!

[Her sisters gasp]]

---

I mean Laurie and his grandfather care a great deal,

---

and we should all be very sorry to have any harm come to you.

---

### JOHN:

Thank you. For saying so.

---

### MEG:

Thank you for… your dedication. To your country. And your studies.

---

### JOHN:

And yours. Did the German book suit you?

---

### MEG:

Oh, yes! But my father, who taught me German, is away, and I don’t get on very fast alone.

---

### JOHN:

Well here I am, a tutor who loves to teach.

---

### JO (horrified) &

### AMY (swooning):

“And Mr. Brooke laid his book on her lap.”

---

### JOHN:

You might try this passage.

---

### BETH:

“Meg read slowly and timidly,”

---

### JOHN:

“unconsciously making poetry of the hard words by the soft intonation of her musical voice.”

---

### MEG:

“And presently, forgetting her listener “

---

### JOHN:

“in the beauty of the sad scene,”

---

### MEG:

“Meg read as if alone.”

---

### JOHN:

“If she had seen her tutor’s eyes then, she would have stopped short, “

---

### MEG:

“but she never looked up until she was finished.”

---

### JOHN:

Very well indeed. Miss March.

---

### MEG:

“He said, quite ignoring her many mistakes,”

---

### JOHN:

“and looking as if he did indeed love… to teach.”

[Others Groan]

---

### LAURIE:

Alright, company, why don’t we retire. Unless Meg wants to indulge in a bit more German.

---

### AMY:

Meg, he is smitten.

### JO:

HA.

### MEG:

Stop being rude, Laurie.

---

### LAURIE:

I’m not!

### JO:

He’s not.

---

### LAURIE:

You were the one lying on the grass reading sad songs!

---

### MEG:

I was not lying on the grass, I was being tutored by your good and respected Mr. Brooke.

---

### AMY:

“Meg looked flushed.”

### BETH:

“and earnest.”

### JO:

“and ridiculous.”

---

### MEG:

So why don’t you do something kind for him by not plaguing the man’s life, Laurie.

---

### LAURIE:

I do not plague him!

---

### MEG:

Yes you do, I can always tell by his face when he leaves your house.

---

If you have been good, he looks satisfied. If you have plagued him, he looks sober.

---

### LAURIE:

So… you keep an account of Brooke’s face, do you?

---

### MEG:

NO I DO NOT, THERE WILL BE NO MORE OF THIS. AMY, BETH, WE’RE GOING.

---

### Amy:

Awwww. Alright, Bye Laurie;

### BETH:

Thank you, Laurie. See you at home, Jo!

---

### AMY:

Thank you for a wonderful day!

### MEG:

NOW AMY.

---

### LAURIE:

Brooke and Meg? Do you think - ?

### JO:

NO.

---

### LAURIE:

Oh it’s terribly obvious and isn’t that romantic?

---

### JO:

No, it’s horrid.

### LAURIE:

Meg doesn’t think so!

---

### JO:

I don’t care what Meg thinks, the idea of anybody coming to take her away from me? No, thank you.

---

### LAURIE:

You’ll feel better when somebody comes to take you away.

---

### JO:

I’d like to see anyone try it.

### LAURIE:

So should I.

---

### JO:

I will box your ears.

---

### LAURIE:

I know, please don’t, let’s talk about books!

---

### LAURIE:

How are your stories coming?

### JO:

Fine. I'm plodding along

---

### LAURIE:

Ooooh are they about me?

### JO:

No they are not about you, you goose

---

### LAURIE:

They should be! Write me as some pirate hero?

---

### JO:

A pirate?! More like a toad prince.

---

### LAURIE:

You wound me, Jo!

[Dramatically pretends to be woudned]

---

### JO:

You deserve it!

---

### MARMEE:

“For two or three hours the October sun lay warmly in the high window,”

---

### MARMEE:

“allowing Jo the time and warmth to write.”

---

---

### JO:

There.

---

“Then she put on her jacket as noiselessly as possible,

---

went out the back, hailed a passing omnibus, and rolled away to town.”

---

---

### LAURIE:

Caught you. Why did you come alone?

---

### JO:

Well it seems I’m not. What are you doing?

### LAURIE:

What were you doing?

---

### JO:

Nothing.

### LAURIE:

With whom?

### JO:

No one.

---

### LAURIE:

You had papers when you went in that building and not when you came out, why?

---

### JO:

Laurie.

### LAURIE:

WHY.

---

### JO:

You are a born wheedler.

---

### LAURIE:

Thank you. Fire away.

---

### JO:

I’ve just left two stories with a newspaperman. He’s to give his answer next week.

---

### LAURIE:

You WHAT? Miss March, the celebrated American authoress!

### JO:

Stop. HushHushHush!

---

### LAURIE:

Miss March, the celebrated American authoress!

### JO:

Laurie, stop!

---

### JO:

It won’t come to anything, but I couldn’t rest till I tried,

---

and I said nothing because I didn’t want anyone to be disappointed.

---

### LAURIE:

They won’t! Jo, your stories are works of Shakespeare

### JO:

Oh stop, Laurie, really. Shakespeare?!

---

### LAURIE:

compared to half the rubbish they print.

---



### JO:

Goodness gracious.I don't know if they'll print them! We have to wait.

---

### LAURIE:

Then let's have some fun while we do.

---

---

### BETH:

“For a week or two, Jo behaved so queerly that her sisters were quite bewildered.”

---

### AMY:

Those two have some secret I know it.

---

### MEG:

She never will behave like a young lady.

---

### BETH:

I hope she won’t. 

---

“Beth said, who had never betrayed that she was a little hurt at Jo’s having secrets with anyone but her.”

---

### MEG:

Anything interesting in the post?

---

### JO:

A story.

### LAURIE:

A good one.

---

### AMY:

What’s the name?

---

### JO & LAURIE:

The Rival Painters. The Rival Painters

---

### AMY:

That sounds rather interesting.

### BETH:

Who wrote it?

---

### JO:

Your sister.

### MEG:

What?

---

### AMY:

Who?

### BETH:

Jo!

---

### JO:

It’s me, I’m the sister, I wrote it.
[All sisters squeel with joy!]

---

### LAURIE:

Jo got herself published! It’s her! She wrote it!

---

[The sisters speak all at once, celebrating Jo and wanting to know everything]

---

### JO:

Ok Ok Ok, The man said he liked both of my stories but didn’t pay beginners, but said it was good practice,

---

so I let him have them, and today this came, and Laurie caught me with it and he said it was good,

---

and the next will be paid for, and I am so happy!

---

### MEG:

Oh, my Jo, I am so proud.

### BETH:

This is a perfect joy!

### AMY:

How thrilling!

---

### MEG:

How does it feel? Are you bursting with happiness?

---

### JO:

Yes I Am It Feels Incredible I Really Did It!

### MEG:

Let’s celebrate!

### LAURIE:

Well done then!

### AMY:

Jo the published writer!

---

[Deeply sad music plays]

---

### MARMEE:

“Mrs. March:
Your husband is very ill. Come at once. Blank Hospital, Washington.”

---

### MEG:

No. No No.

### JO:

Father is ill?

---

### AMY:

Very ill, it said.

### BETH:

What does that mean?

---

### MEG:

What do we do?

### JO:

Mother, what do we do?

---

### MARMEE:

You all stay, I shall go, There’s no time for tears,

[The girls try to interrupt]

---

Be calm, girls, and let me think, Where’s Laurie?

---

### LAURIE:

Here, ma’am. What can I do? I can go anywhere.

---

### MARMEE:

The next train goes early in the morning. Send a telegram saying I will come at once.

---

But don’t kill yourself driving too fast. There is no need of that.

---

### JO:

“But minutes later Laurie tore by the window on his own horse riding as if for his life.”

---

### MARMEE:

Jo, run to the rooms, and bring supplies for nursing. Hospital stores are not always good.

---

Beth, go and ask Mr. Laurence for a few bottles of wine, I’m not too proud to beg for Father.

---

Amy, get the black trunk. Meg, help me find my things.

---

### MEG:

Yes mother.

### AMY:

I’ll fetch it now.

---

### JO:

“Everyone scattered like leaves in a gust of wind.”

---

### JOHN:

Miss March, I came to offer myself as escort to your mother. I wish to be of service to her on the journey.”

---

### MEG:

Mr. Brooke, how kind. It will be such a relief to know that she has someone to take care of her.

---

Thank you very, very much.

### JOHN:

It is my pleasure and honor

---

### MEG:

I’ll let her know that you’ve come.

### JOHN:

Also I wonder if I might speak to -

---

### MEG:

Mother, Mr. Brooke is cooling - calling! That’s the tea - the tea is cooling,

---

Mr. Brooke is calling. So sorry, I should go, please come in.

---

### JOHN:

You needn’t go, Miss March -

---

### JOHN:

“But she did. The short afternoon wore away - “

---

### MARMEE:

“With every errand resolved”

---

### JO:

“when Jo ran in with a roll of bills.”

---

### JO:

There! There you go, that’s my contribution toward bringing Father home.

---

[They all worriedly ask Jo questions about the money]

### MARMEE:

Jo, you haven't done anything rash?

---

### JO:

It's mine, I only sold what was my own.

---

[Everyone gasps]

### AMY

Oh, Jo, how could? Your one beauty!

---

### JO:

Now it doesn’t affect the fate of the nation, so don’t wail.

---

Now my head feels deliciously light and boyish and easy to keep in order,

---

I’m satisfied, so please take the money.

---

### AMY:

What made you do it? I would as soon have cut off her head as her hair.”

---

### JO:

I had to do something.

### MARMEE:

Thank you, dear. Thank you.

---

[Sound of a carraige]

### JOHN:

“The rattle of an approaching carriage made them all start.”

---

### MARMEE:

Now Meg, be prudent while I’m gone, watch over your sisters.

---

Be patient, Jo, don’t do any more rash things, write to me often, and be my brave girl.

---

Beth, comfort yourself with your music, and help the Hummels;

---

and Amy, be obedient.

---

### AMY:

But to who?

### MEG:

We will, Mother.

---

### JOHN:

“Brooke helped load the supplies on the carriage,”

---

### LAURIE:

“And Laurie and his grandfather came over to see her off.”

---

### MARMEE:

How kind everyone is to us.

### JOHN:

I don’t see how we can help it.

---

### AMY:

“returned Mr. Brooke,”

### MEG:

“who looked so strong”

---

### BETH:

“and sensible”

### JO:

(reluctantly)“and… kind “

---

### MEG:

“that the girls christened him ‘Mr. Greatheart’ on the spot.”

### JO:

(mumbling)“Greatheart…”

---

### MARMEE:

Goodbye, darlings, be good and brave, I love you.

---

### BETH:

Tell father we love him!

### MEG:

Goodbye, Mother. All our love.

---

---

[Jo begins to cry]

---

### MEG:

Jo, dear, what is it? About father? He’ll be alright. I know it.

---

### JO:

No. It’s... my hair.

---

### MEG:

No, it’s wonderful.

### BETH:

So generous.

### AMY:

A true sacrifice.

---

### LAURIE:

I like it. You rather look like me.

---

[Jo wails in despair]

[The sisters all talk over each other and chastise Laurie for his unhelpful words]

---

[Transition Music]

---

### JO:

Where’s Beth gone?

---

### MEG:

To the Hummels. I was supposed to but I do enough for other people’s children all day, I’m too tired.

---

### JO:

I told her I couldn’t go with my cold.

---

### MEG:

I thought it was almost well?

---

### JO:

It’s well enough for me to go out with Laurie, but not well enough to go to the Hummels.

---

### MEG:

Jo.

### JO:

What? I want to finish my writing!

---

### MEG:

We’re terrible.

### JO:

We are a set of rascals this morning

---

### MEG:

Why must you always use such dreadful expressions?!

---

### JO:

Because I like good strong words that mean something.

---

### BETH:

You’ve - you’ve- you’ve all had scarlet fever, haven’t you? You’ve had it?

---

### JO:

Fever?

### MEG:

What?

---

### BETH:

Haven’t you had it?!

### JO:

Yes Years ago, when Meg did.

---

### MEG:

Bethy, What’s wrong?

### BETH:

The baby.

---

I went to see The Hummels, Marmee told us not to forget them, and it -

---

it - it died in my lap -

---

### MEG:

BETH!

### JO:

What?

---

### BETH:

Right in my lap.

---

### MEG:

Oh, Beth no!

### JO:

Bethy!

---

### BETH:

Mrs. Hummel went for a doctor and it went cold and I tried to warm its feet, but it didn’t stir,

---

and Mrs. Hummel came back with the doctor and he said it was scarlet fever and they should have called him earlier -

---

### MEG:

Oh nonono.

### JO:

God in Heaven.

---

### BETH:

but Mrs. Hummel said she had tried to cure the baby herself, then the doctor turned around

---

and told me to go home and take belladonna right away or I’d have it too.

---

### MEG:

No, you won’t!

### JO:

Oh, Beth,

---

if you should be sick I’d never forgive myself.

---

### BETH:

Don’t be frightened, I think I shan’t have it badly.

---

### JO:

You’ve been over there with the baby every day for a week.

---

### BETH:

Where’s Amy?

### JO:

She’s at school!

---

### BETH:

You have to to stop her before she gets back.

### MEG:

We’ll send her to Aunt March.

---

### BETH:

Yes she cannot be in the house with me -

### JO:

Don't’ worry about her, you need to get to bed,

---

### MEG:

we’ll get you medicine and call the doctor.

---

### BETH:

Can’t you and Meg have it over again?

### JO:

No,

---

but it would serve me right to let you go while I was writing rubbish.

---

### BETH:

It’s not rubbish -

### MEG:

Go lay down Beth, right now.

---

### JO:

I’ll bring food.

### MEG:

I’ll start a bath.

---

[Transition Music]

---

### LAURIE:

Shall I telegraph to your mother, do anything, what can I do?

---

### MEG:

We ought to tell Marmee if Beth is really ill -

### JO:

But Mother can’t leave Father,

---

and it will only make them anxious, if it’s not that bad -

### MEG:

but it doesn’t seem right to keep it from them.

---

### JO:

I don’t know what to do.

---

There doesn’t seem to be anything to hold on to when Marmee’s gone.

---

### MEG:

We’ll manage for now. Amy’s safe with Aunt March,

---

### LAURIE:

Bored and aggravated, I checked, but safe.

---

### JO:

We can help Beth, the doctor isn’t far if we need him, Laurie is here, we'll be alright.

---

### LAURIE:

We will.

### MEG:

We must.

---

### JO:

“So the hours went on and Beth was suddenly much sicker than anyone but the doctor suspected.”

---

### MEG:

“Meg stayed at home and kept a telegram ready to send off to Marmee the minute things might turn.”

---

### JO:

“Jo devoted herself to Beth day and night. Only growing scared when when the fever fits began -”

---

### MEG:

“ and Beth did not know the faces around her -”

---

### BETH:

“ and called and called for her mother who was not there”

---

### LAURIE:

“while the shadow of death hovered over them all.”

---

### JO:

“Laurie haunted the house like a restless ghost,”

---

### LAURIE:

“and Mr. Laurence locked the grand piano.”

---

### MEG:

“It was then that Meg felt how rich she had been in things more precious than any luxuries money could buy—

---

in love, peace, and health.”

---

### JO:

“And in the darkened room with her suffering little sister Jo saw the beauty of Beth’s unselfish ambition to live for others.

---

### MEG:

I wish I had no heart, it aches so.

---

---

### JO:

I’ve just sent for Mother. Beth isn’t going to - she might not -

### LAURIE:

No No No,

---

it’s not so bad as that, is it?

---

### JO:

It is, she doesn’t look like my Beth, she doesn’t know us, and there’s nobody to help us.

---

God seems so far away I can’t find Him.

---

### LAURIE:

I’m here. Hold on to me, I’m here.

---

---

### JO:

[Crying]
It’s just that no one can love Bethy as I do. She is my conscience, and I can’t give her up, I can’t, I can’t.

---

### LAURIE:

I know. Listen to me. She’s so good, and we all love her so much, I don’t believe God will take her away, not yet.

---

### JO:

But good people die every day.

### LAURIE:

Not our Beth and not today.

---

And - and - Jo, I need to tell you something,

---

I kept it from you and I have to tell you -

### JO:

Not now, I need to tend to her, she needs me.

---

### LAURIE:

Jo, listen -

### JO:

Just go help Meg, I can manage.

---

### LAURIE:

Jo. I telegraphed to your mother yesterday about Beth,

---

Brooke already answered saying she’d come at once, she’ll be here tonight,

---

I’ll bring her from the station myself and everything will be alright -

---

### JO:

YouDidWhat? You did it?

### LAURIE:

Yes.

---

### JO:

You really did?

### LAURIE:

I did.

---

### JO:

She’s really coming home?

### LAURIE:

Tonight. I knew you need her so -

---

### JO:

Oh Laurie, thank you. Thank you thank you thank you.

---

### JO:

I’m sorry, that was, so sorry, just that you were such a dear to do that,

---

I couldn’t help flying at you. How shall I ever thank you?

---

### LAURIE:

Fly at me again, I rather liked it.

---

### JO:

Don’t tease me, Laurie, I was overcome!

---

### LAURIE:

And I’m saying you should stay that way.

---

### JO:

Laurie.

### LAURIE:

Jo.

---

### JO:

Laurie, just go.

### LAURIE:

I don’t want to go.

---

### JO:

Go home and rest, you’ll be up half the night waiting for mother to… come home.

---

### JO:

Thank you, Teddy.

### LAURIE:

Anything for… Beth.

---

[Music transition]

---

### MEG:

“No sleep came to them as they kept their watch - “

---

### JO:

“with that dreadful sense of powerlessness which comes to us in hours like these.”

---

### MEG:

“And the clock struck twelve.”

---

### JO:

“And the house was still as death.”

---

---

### LAURIE:

Jo.

### MARMEE:

OhMyGirls.

---

### JO / LOUISA:

“I don’t think I have any words in which to describe the reunion of mothers and daughters. So I will leave it to you.”

---

### MARMEE:

“Like sunshine after a storm were the peaceful weeks which followed.”

---

### JO:

“Beth improved rapidly which fitly ushered in a splendid Christmas Day.”

---

### ALL:

Merry Christmas!

---

### LAURIE:

And another Christmas present for the March family -

---

### MARMEE:

But before the words were well out of his mouth,

### AMY:

appeared a tall man,

---

### MEG:

In a uniform

### AMY:

Is that - ?

---

### BETH:

No.

### JO:

Father?

---

[The family cheers with joy around their father]

---

### LAURIE:

“Mr. March became invisible in the embrace of so many loving arms.”

---

### BETH:

“There never was such a Christmas as they had that day.”

---

### JO:

Father home, Beth well, Amy safe, Laurie here, Meg unmarried -

---

### MEG:

What?

### JO:

Everything we love for Christmas!

---

### MEG:

(delighted) Mr Brooke.

### JO:

(grim) Mr Brooke.

---

### MEG:

“Her father told them how devoted Brooke had been”

---

### AMY:

“and how he was altogether a most estimable and upright young man.”

---

### JO:

(irked) Estimable and upright? Redundant. Shall we eat?

---

### JOHN:

Miss March.

### MEG:

Merry Christmas, Mr. Brook.

---

### JOHN:

It is now.
[Jo Scoffs]

---

[Beth plays the piano for a moment]

### JO:

WhatOwWhat.

---

### LAURIE:

Now you’ve done it.

### JOHN:

What?

---

### LAURIE:

It’s not enough to get one of them to love you. They come as a set.

---

### MEG:

Don’t plague me, Jo, I’ve told you I don’t care about him-

### JO:

Uh huh.

---

### MEG:

much.

### JO:

AH HA.

---

### MEG:

JO, STOP THIS RIGHT NOW!

---

### JO:

I can’t, because I know the truth, if he did ask, you would accept him instead of giving the man a good, decided no.

---

### MEG:

I’m not so silly and weak as you think. I know what I should say.

---

### JO:

What is it then, huhhuhhuh?

---

### MEG:

I would say: ‘Thank you, Mr. Brooke, you are very kind,

---

but I agree with Father that I am too young to enter into any engagement at present, so please let us be friends.’

---

### JO:

I don’t believe it. You’ll say yes, rather than hurt his feelings

---



### MEG:

No, I won’t!This is plaguing! You are plaguing!

---

### JOHN:

Excuse me, ladies. I just came to get my umbrella.

---

### JO:

Oh really, an umbrella?

### MEG:

JO.

---

### JOHN:

I’ll retrieve it later.

### MEG:

Oh you needn’t go, Mr Brooke, please.

---

### JO:

Yes, please, because Meg has something important to say to you.

### MEG:

Jo.

---

### JO:

has something important to say to you. Very important.

---

### MEG:

Then go and let me say it.

---

### JO:

I will.

---

### JOHN:

Are you… afraid of me, Margaret?

---

### MEG:

“He had never called her Margaret before. She bushed.”

### JOHN:

“He did too.”

---

### MEG:

How can I be afraid when you have been so kind to Father? I only wish I could thank you for it.

---

### JOHN:

Shall I tell you how?

### MEG:

“He held her hand,”

---

### JOHN:

“and looking down at Meg with so much love”

---

### MEG:

“ that her heart began to flutter, and she both longed to run away and to stop and listen.”

---

### JOHN:

Margaret?

### MEG:

Oh no, please don’t, I can’t -

---

### JOHN:

Wait, I won’t trouble you. I only want to know if you care for me a little, Meg.

---

I… I love you so much.

---

### MEG:

“This was the moment for the speech. But Meg forgot the whole of it and said - ”

---

I don’t know.

---

### JOHN:

Oh. Will you try and find out?

---

### MEG:

I don’t think so. I’m much too young.

---

### JOHN:

Then I’ll wait, and you could learn to love.

---

### MEG:

If I chose to learn, perhaps, but I must choose it -

---

### JOHN:

Then please choose to learn. I do so love to teach. And this should be easier than German.

---

### MEG:

“Meg saw a satisfied smile of one who had no doubt of his success. Which nettled her.”

---

### JOHN:

What is your answer?

### MEG:

I don’t choose. I don’t. Please go away and let me be.

---

### JOHN:

Go away? I’m sorry. Do you really mean that?

### MEG:

Yes, I do mean it.

---

### JOHN:

Because I thought -

### MEG:

Father says it’s too soon and I’d rather not.

---

### JOHN:

Don’t play with me, Meg. I didn’t think that of you.

---

### MEG:

Don’t think of me at all. I’d rather you wouldn’t.

---

### JOHN:

“He just stood looking at her so wistfully - “

---

### MEG:

“that she found her heart relenting in spite of herself.”

---

### JOHN:

“What would have happened next he couldn’t say - “

---

### MEG:

“Because Aunt March came hobbling in -“

---

### AUNT MARCH:

Bless me, what’s all this, and who's that,

---

and what has this man said to make you look like a peony?

---

### MEG:

It’s Father’s friend Mr. Brooke, Aunt March, and I’m just so surprised to see you.

---

### AUNT MARCH:

That’s evident.

---

And yes I’ve heard of this impoverished tutor fellow who's caught your eye.

---

### JOHN:

Excuse me, ladies.

### MEG:

Aunt March.

---

### AUNT MARCH:

Margaret, my dear. You haven’t gone and accepted him, this Cook?

---

### MEG:

Brooke, and no, and hush, he’ll hear you!

---

### AUNT MARCH:

You do know that if you marry him not one penny of my money ever goes to you?

---

### MEG:

I shall marry whom I please, Aunt March, and you can leave your money to anyone you like.

---

### AUNT MARCH:

You’ll be sorry for that when you’ve tried love in a cottage.

---

You ought to marry well and help your family. Not this Rook -

### MEG:

Brooke.

---

### AUNT MARCH:

I don’t need to remember his name if he's not marrying you, and he’s not,

---

not when you might be comfortable all your days by minding me and doing better.

---

### MEG:

I couldn’t do better if I waited half my life!

---

John is good and wise, he’s got heaps of talent, he’s willing to work, he’s brave,

---

everyone likes and respects him, and I’m proud to think he cares for me. I’m not afraid of being poor.

---

I’ve been happy so far, and I know I shall be with him because he loves me, and I love...

---

### AUNT MARCH:

Come back then, young man.

---

### AUNT MARCH:

Congratulations, she’s lost her mind.

---

### JOHN:

I couldn’t help hearing. That you do care for me a little bit then?

---

### MEG:

I didn’t know how much till she abused you.

---

### JOHN:

Which means that I needn’t go away, but be happy? With you?

### MEG:

Yes.

---

### JOHN:

Yes?

### MEG:

Yes.

---

### JOHN:

Yes?

### MEG:

Yes, John, yes.

---

### MEG:

Jo. Congratulate us won’t you?

---

### JO:

I…

---

### LAURIE:

Congratulations, Mrs Brooke!

### JO:

Congratulations....

---

### MEG:

Not yet, Laurie.

### JOHN:

But in due time, so I shall invite you to our wedding on the spot.

---

### JO:

A wedding, Meg?

### LAURIE:

And of course I’ll come, the sight of Jo’s face alone.

---

### JO:

Laurie.

### LAURIE:

Sorry!

---

### MEG:

Jo. Jo, I -

### JOHN:

Please, Jo… sister, I want only her every happiness.

---

### JO:

… congratulations. Excuse us.

---

### LAURIE:

What’s the matter?

### JO:

You can’t know how hard it is for me to give her up.

---

### LAURIE:

You don’t give her up. You only go halves. And you’ve got me, anyhow.

---

I’m not good for much, but I’ll stand by you, Jo, all the days of my life. Upon my word I will.

---

### JO:

I know you will.

---

### LAURIE:

And we’ll have capital times after she is gone, I’ll be through college before long,

---

and then we’ll go abroad on some nice trip, you and I!

---

### JO:

That sounds nice. But there’s no knowing what may happen in three years.

---

### LAURIE:

True. Don’t you wish you could take a look forward and see where we shall all be then?

---

### JO:

Except that I might see something sad, and everyone looks so happy now.

---

### LAURIE:

Then let’s be happy.

---

### JO:

… Yes. Let’s.

---

“And Jo’s eyes went slowly round the room.”

[Beth Plays Piano]

### MARMEE:

“Father and Mother sat together,

quietly reliving the first chapter of the romance which for them began some twenty years ago.”

---

### AMY:

“And Amy drew the lovers, Meg and John,“

---

### MEG:

“who sat apart in a beautiful world of their own.”

---

### BETH:

“And Beth played her piano beautifully. “

---

### LAURIE:

“And Laurie smiled and nodded at Jo in the mirror - “

“which reflected them both.”

“Which. Reflected. Them both!” Awwwww.

To Laurie?

---

### MEG:

### MARMEE:

How will you tell it?

---

### AMY:

My goodness, who do they marry?!

### BETH:

Will there be more of the story?

---

### LOUISA / JO:

I suppose that depends on whether anyone likes the first book enough to want a second.

---

### BETH:

Oh my dear sister

### MEG:

---

### AMY:

My topsy turvy girl!

### MARMEE:

In fact.

Celebrated American Authoress… What’s next?

---

[End of Act One]

---

---

### LOUISA:

The first book is apparently a sensation.

---

Now I must write the sequel. In part to satisfy my publisher.

---

And in greater part to satiate the legions of enthusiastic young ladies

---

writing every week to my house demanding to know when Jo will marry Laurie. Arghhhhh.

---

### LAURIE:

Laurie and Jo?! Whaaaaaaat, noooo, him?!?!?!

---

He’s only her very best, very rich and very handsome friend.

---

### LOUISA:

And her only friend. She’s never known anything but him, and Concord, and her family, she doesn’t know who she is!

---

### LAURIE:

But Laurie does. And he loves her exactly as she is.

---

### LOUISA:

Which is as his friend, not his wife. Jo can’t marry him. Actually she can’t marry anyone.

---

No, Jo should be a literary spinster, free to write and live and… paddle her own canoe.

---

### LAURIE:

Yes, absolutely, also most canoes have room for two.

---

### LOUISA/JO:

This is not your book.

---

### LAURIE:

Tell that to the girls at your door, Miss Alcott.

[Louisa/Jo groans angrily]

### MARMEE:

“Three years have passed for our quiet family. The war is over, father is home - “

---

### MEG:

“Meg is prettier than ever, for love is a great beautifier,

---

and even though they are poor, when she marries her John and walks into the humble home he’d built for her,

---

she feels herself the richest, happiest girl in Christendom.”

---

### BETH:

“Jo devotes herself to literature and Beth, who remains delicate long after the fever,”

---

### AMY:

“Amy takes over Jo’s sitting with Aunt March

---

who bribes the youngest girl with drawing lessons and the finer things in life - “

“Laurie, having dutifully gone to college to please his grandfather is now determined to please himself.

---

entimental, gymnastic, talks slang, and more than once comes perilously near expulsion.”

---

### JO:

Laurie?! Expulsion?! What Is Wrong With You!?

---

### LAURIE:

Don’t lecture me, Jo, I have enough of that at school.

---

### JO:

Well if you want pampering go find Amy.

---

### LAURIE:

About that, Parker is really getting desperate about her,

---

writes awful poetry, but he’d make a good husband.

---

### JO:

There will be no more marrying in this family for years to come, thank you.

---

### LAURIE:

Oh please, you’ll go next.

### JO:

I will do no such thing!

---

There should be one old maid in every house.

---

### LAURIE:

Because you won’t give anyone a chance.

---

### JO:

Because a woman is more than who she marries!

---

### LAURIE:

Mark my words, Jo. You’ll. Go. Next.

### JO:

You. Go First.

---

### LAURIE:

I’d rather stay here.

---

### JO:

You do flirt desperately, Teddy.

---

### LAURIE:

I’d give anything if I could say, ‘So do you’.

---

### JO:

“When Laurie first went to college, he fell in love about once a month,”

---

### LAURIE:

“but these small flames were as brief as ardent.”

---

### JO:

“But there came a time when Laurie ceased to worship at many shrines, “

---

### LAURIE:

“hinted darkly at one all-absorbing passion,“

---

### JO:

“and indulged occasionally in Byronic fits of gloom.”

---

### LAURIE:

Byronic?! How dare you.

---

### JO:

“Jo preferred imaginary heroes to real ones, because the former could be shut up on a shelf.”

---

### JO:

“Every few weeks Jo would lock herself in her room and ‘fall into a vortex’,

---

writing away at her novel with all her heart and soul,

---

for till that was finished she could find no peace.”

---

### MARMEE:

“During these periods her family kept their distance.”

---

### JO:

“When the writing fit came on, she gave herself up to it,

---

led a blissful life, unconscious of want or care while she sat in an imaginary world,

---

full of friends almost as real and dear to her as any in the flesh.”

---

### MEG:

“Until one day a letter arrived”

---

### JO:

I- I- I… won. A story contest, first prize, a hundred dollars for my story.

---

### MARMEE:

You won!?

[Sisters chatter excitedly]

---

### JO:

It’s just a little sensation story, romance and tragedy,

---

and I know it’s all rubbish but it’s apparently good rubbish.

---

### MARMEE:

It’s a triumph!

### MEG:

Never mind the money.

---

### AMY:

Always mind the money! What will you do with your fortune?

---

### JO:

I think we shall send Beth and Mother to the seaside for a month.

---

### BETH:

Nooooo!

### JO:

It will do you goodAnd keep Beth healthy. Go go go go!

---

### JO:

“Jo fell to work, bent on earning more of those delightful checks.”

---

### MEG:

“The Duke’s Daughter paid the butcher’s bill,”

---

### AMY:

“A Phantom Hand put down a new carpet,”

---

### MEG:

“and The Curse of the Coventrys turned into groceries and gowns.”

---

### AMY:

“Jo ceased to envy richer girls, taking great comfort in the knowledge that -

---

### JO:

“She need ask no one for a penny ever again.”

---

### JO:

NO! No No No, WHY?!

---

Amy goes to Europe with Aunt March and I don’t?!

---

### MARMEE:

Your aunt invited her and it is not for us to dictate such a favor.

---

### JO:

But but but Amy’s too young, it’s my turn first, I’ve wanted this for so long!

---

### MARMEE:

I know, and I am sorry, dear, but I’m afraid it’s partly your own fault.

---

### JO:

My fault, how?

---

### MARMEE:

You know your Aunt,

---

she told me she regretted your blunt manners and too independent spirit,

---

she wrote that she ‘planned to ask Jo, but as she ‘hates French’ I think I won’t venture to invite. her..”.

---

Your aunt thinks that Amy is more docile.

---

### JO:

Well that I will never be on any continent.

---

### MARMEE:

I think that’s rather the point, dear.

---

### JO:

Aghhhhhh, My abominable tongue .Why can’t I learn to keep quiet?

---

She gets absolutely everything!

---

### BETH:

I’m so sorry, Jo.

---

### MARMEE:

I am too, but try to bear it cheerfully so we don’t sadden Amy’s pleasure.

---

### JO:

Yes I wouldn’t want anything spoiled for Amy.

---

### BETH:

I’m very selfish, but… I’m glad you are not going quite yet. I love you too much to let you go.

---

### JO:

And I will always choose my Beth over all of Europe. Except France. The cheese!

---

### AMY:

Wait Europe?! Who’se going to Europe?

---

### MARMEE:

Well, my dear, it seems that… you are.

---

### AMY:

Me? Is this a trick? Are you teasing me, Jo?

---

### JO:

(bitter) No I am not.

### BETH:

It’s true, Amy! It’s you!

---

### MARMEE:

Aunt March just invited you to be her companion this summer.

---

### AMY:

PACK MY PENCILS I’M GOING TO FRANCE!!!!!!!

---

### AMY:

And it isn’t a mere pleasure trip to me, girls.

---

It will decide my career, for if I have any genius, I shall find it out in Rome, and will do something to prove it.

---

### JO:

Or you’ll marry some rich man and sit in the lap of luxury all your days.

---

### AMY:

If I can’t be an artist myself, but I wish to be.

---

### JO:

Well. If you wish it you’ll have it, unlike some of us…

---

### AMY:

What?

### BETH:

Jo.

---

### JO:

Nothing.

---

### AMY:

Oh Jo. I’m sorry, I didn’t realize. Would you like to go?

---

### JO:

Nono. I hate French and it seems they hate me.

---

### AMY:

Oh. Well please don’t be angry with me. And in a year or two I’ll send for you,

---

and we’ll carry out all the plans and adventures we’ve made so many times.

---

### JO:

Thank you. I’ll remind you of your promise one day. But for now… enjoy every minute.

---

### AMY:

I will I will I will! The art! The fashion!

---

### AMY & JO:

The cheeeeeese!

---

### MARMEE:

I am sorry. And I wonder - besides Europe - what you wish for, my girl?

---

### JO:

Something new. I feel restless and anxious. I’d like to hop a little way and try my wings.

---

### MARMEE:

And where will you hop?

---

### JO:

To… New York? I think?

---

Didn’t Mrs. Kirke write to you for some respectable young person to teach her children?

---

### MARMEE:

You’d want to go out to service in that great boarding house? What about your writing?

---

### JO:

All the better for the change, I think. I shall see and hear new things, get new ideas.

---

### MARMEE:

I have no doubt of it,

---

but… Jo, you have to tell me truly. Are these your only reasons for leaving?

---

### JO:

I’m afraid Laurie is getting too fond of me.

---

### MARMEE:

Then you don’t care for him in the way it is evident he cares for you?

---

### JO:

… No. I think?

---

I love the dear boy, as I always have, but anything more is out of the question.

---

### MARMEE:

Well I’m glad of that.

---

### JO:

You are?

---

### MARMEE:

Oh yes, I don’t think you are suited to one another. As friends you are but married?

---

You are too much alike and too fond of freedom,

---

not to mention both of your tempers and strong wills.

---

### JO:

That’s just the feeling I had, but I know he cares for me desperately,

---

but I couldn’t fall in love with him merely out of gratitude?

---

### MARMEE:

No No No and a true and good friend would never ask it of you.

---

But it will require you telling him as much. That you must do. And soon.

---

### JO:

… Soon.

---

### LAURIE:

You’re going to New York? City? Alright, when are we leaving?

---

### JO:

NoNoNo, this is about my autonomy.

---

The teaching will render me independent, and I’ll write, and the new society will be so inspiring,

---

and the truth is that I am eager to be gone,

---

home is growing too narrow for my nature, restless and adventurous as it is.

---

### LAURIE:

I know what it is. And of course I am happy for your adventure.

---

Just come home. I’ll wait. Because it won’t do a bit of good, Jo.

---

My eye is on you. No one else but-

---

### JO:

(rapidly) You’re So Funny Laurie Ok Goodbye

---

be good, study hard, don’t get expelled, no billards, do not wait for me, OfIGoThen Byeeeeeeee!

---

### JO:

New York City, November

---

Dear Marmee and Beth,

---

Mrs. Kirke welcomed me so kindly I felt at home at once, even in this big house full of strangers.

---

She gave me a funny little sky parlor with a nice table in a sunny window, so I can write whenever I like.

---

The two little girls are rather spoiled

---

but they took to me after I acted out “The Seven Bad Pigs” and made them laugh.

---

And there seem to be kind people here.

---

Last week I stood waiting for a servant girl to lumber up the long flights, when a gentleman came along -

---

took the heavy load and carried it all the way up for her.

---

Mrs. K. said, “That must have been Professor Bhaer, he’s always doing things of that sort.”

---

She said he was from Berlin, very learned but poor as a church mouse,

---

and gives lessons to support his two orphan nephews.

---

He hosts scholars in the room next to the nursery because the girls love him, so we’ll be close-

---

Near. Nearby. In proximity. He’s almost forty, so it’s no harm, Marmee.

---

[Bhaer sings in the background]

Though yesterday… yesterday I overheard him… singing…

---

It was dreadfully improper to listen in, I couldn’t resist the temptation,

---

and lifting one end of the curtain, I peeped in.

---

Professor Bhaer was there. With the kindest eyes I ever saw.

---

### LAURIE:

The kindest what?

---

### MARMEE:

It’s Jo’s new friend.

### LAURIE:

What kind of friend?

---

### BETH:

A professor.

### LAURIE:

What kind of professor?

---

### BETH:

Hush Laurie. Let us read it!

---

“He was neither rich nor great, young nor handsome, yet he was as warm as a

---

[Beth coughs]

### MARMEE:

as warm as a genial fire.”

---

### MARMEE:

“He was poor, yet always appeared to be giving something away; a stranger, yet everyone was his friend.

---

I try to discover his charm, and I have decided what it is…

---

benevolence. He turned only his sunny side to the world.”

---

### BHAER:

You peep at me, I peep at you.

---

### JO:

Oh my goodness. I’m so sorry.

---

### BHAER:

You are sorry to listen, I am sorry to sing.

---

### JO:

No! Your singing was lovely. I didn’t mean to spy, I was only intrigued.

---

### BHAER:

And I am only Fredriech Bhaer. Professor.

---

### JO:

Jo March. Governess.

---

### BHAER:

Yes my little friends have told me of you and your stories of terrible pigs.

---

### JO:

Have they? I am better with stories than children,

---

but I don’t think I’m altogether a bad influence on them. Yet.

---

### BHAER:

Everyone is someone’s “yet.”

---

### JO:

Anyway, I apologize again, lovely voice you have, goodnight.

---

### BHAER:

Do you know it? The song is based on a poem by Goethe.

---

### JO:

Oh! No I don’t know it, nor do I know German, but it sounded beautifully…

---

sad? Or happy? Or rather both. Like a memory of home.

---

### BHAER:

Yes this! Are you certain you do not know German?

---

### JO:

It is not the sort of thing one forgets learning.

---

### BHAER:

Have you a wish to learn then?

---

### JO:

Oh, well yes but you are too busy and I am too stupid.

---

###

BHAER:Nonsense. One can always make the time for important things.

---

We start with what you just heard.

### JO:

Oh, now, we’re starting now - ?

---

### BHAER:

“Kennst du das Land, wo die Zitronen blühn,Im dunklen Laub die Gold-Orangen glühn,”

---

Do you know the land where lemon trees blossom, where golden oranges glow amid dark leaves.

---

“Ein sanfter Wind vom blauen Himmel weht.Die Myrte still und hoch der Lorbeer steht,”

---

“A gentle wind blows from the blue sky, the myrtle stands silent, the laurel tall”

---

“Kennst du es wohl? Dahin! DahinMöcht’ ich mit dir, o mein Geliebter, ziehen.”

---

Do you know it? There, O there I desire to go with you, my beloved.

---

That’s all for us! Goodnight!

---

### JO:

Goodnight.

---

### JO:

My Precious Bethy,The professor I mentioned before.

---

He and I are friends now… good friends. We often walk together -

---

when we need to go the same way of course -

---

and have been to several lectures on literature and politics and

---

### BHAER:

Have you a copy of the plays of Shakespeare?

---

### JO:

Oh! Well. At home I have one or two but not the whole of them.

---

### BHAER:

Now you do. You say often you wish a library. Here is one which is many books in one.

---

Read him well and he will help you much with your stories,

---

for the study of character in this book will help you to paint it with your pen.

---

### JO:

Oh my goodness. Thank you.

---

This is most wonderful thing that anyone has ever done for me.

---

### BHAER:

A good writer needs a good writer.

---

### JO:

‘From my friend Friedrich Bhaer.’

---

### JO:

Do tell Meg that I am starting to understand the appeal of German… teachers.

---

Sometimes I feel as though, even if my pen lays idle,

---

I might be laying the foundation for the story of… my own life.

---

Mr Bhaer thinks I’m a rather good writer too.

---

I so dearly want to be worthy of his… friendship.

---

But I spoke with the publisher of the Weekly Volcano Mr. Dashwood and he says that

---

“righteousness doesn't sell nowadays” and I suppose he would know. He gave me 25 dollars for my story,

---

and said to make the next ones “short and spicy and never mind the moral.”

---

But then I wonder what my friend would think? Of my writing.

---

I almost wish I hadn’t any conscience, it’s so inconvenient.

---

Read Laurie a bit of my letters won’t you. I will be home in June.

---

Bless you all! Ever your loving Jo.

---

[Music Transition]

---

### BHAER:

You must be happy that you have a home to go back in.

---

### JO:

To. A home to go back to.

---

But yes I do miss it terribly. “Kennst du das Land” as your friend Goethe says.

---

### BHAER:

One day I would like to know it. Where you call home.

---

### JO:

Well then come, come and see us if you ever travel our way! You must!

---

### BHAER:

Do you? Want me to -? Shall I come to your village?

---

### JO:

Concord! Yes, come next month! Laurie graduates then and what fun that will be!

---

### BHAER:

That is your friend, of whom you often speak?

---

### JO:

Yes, my boy Teddy. I’m very proud of him.

---

### BHAER:

“Something in Mr. Bhaer’s face suddenly recalled the fact that she might find Laurie more than a friend,”

---

### JO:

“and because she wished to look as if nothing was the matter, the more she tried not to blush, the redder she grew.”

---

### BHAER:

Well. I wish the friend much success, and you all happiness. God bless you, Miss March.

---

### JO:

Oh. Yes. Goodbye then, Professor Bhaer.

---

### JO:

“But that night…”

### BHAER:

“that night

---

he stood before his fire thinking of Jo.”

---

### JO:

“And early as it was the next morning,

---

### BHAER:

“he was at the station to see her off.”

---

### JO:

“Thanks to him, she began her journey home with his smile,”

---

### BHAER:

“a bunch of violets to keep her company,”

---

### JO:

“and best of all, this happy thought:”

---

### JO:

‘That the winter’s gone, I’ve written no books, and earned no fortune,

---

but I’ve made a friend worth having.’

---

### MEG:

Welcome home, darling Jo!

### BETH:

We’ve missed you!

---

### JO:

“But when Jo came home, she was struck with the change in Beth.

---

No one seemed aware of it -”

---

### BETH:

“for it had come too gradually to startle those who saw her daily,”

---

### JO:

“but to eyes sharpened by absence, it was very plain.

---

A heavy weight fell on Jo’s heart as she saw her sister’s face.”

---

### BETH:

I’m so very glad to have you home.

---

### JO:

No more glad than I am to be back. How are you?

---

### BETH:

… Good.

---

### JO:

… Alright.

---

### BETH:

… Alright.

---

### JO:

Well I’m here now, my dear. I’m here for you.

---

### BETH:

I know.

---

### MEG:

Well John loves jelly, so I made up my mind to be the perfect wife

---

and I spent all day picking the currants and boiling and straining and sugaring

---

and I vowed to do it all on my own and not brother Marmee and do you know what?

---

### JO:

I predict the jelly didn’t gel.

---

### MEG:

The jelly didn’t gel! No matter what I did!

---

I remade it half a dozen times! And the kitchen is a mess

---

and the twins are weeping and then I’m weeping

---

and I feel like a monstrous wife and terrible mother and worse cook and then -

---

### JO:

Oh no.

### MARMEE:

Oh Meg.

---

### BETH:

I’ve heard it already but it is awful -

---

### MEG:

THEN John comes home with a guest.

---

### JO:

Oh no no no

---

### MEG:

And I am so tired with the children and the kitchen and jelly

---

and I say “Do come and help me or I shall die!” And then… he laughed.

---

### JO:

He did not!

### MARMEE:

Oh it just gets worse.

---

### MEG:

LAUGHED. Well I fell apart and sent both of them to Marmee for dinner.

---

### MARMEE:

She did.

### BETH:

They showed up looking a bit confused.

---

### MEG:

And now it’s been days and we haven’t managed a single kind word to each other,

---

and when he comes home I’m shut up tending the children,

---

and I am certain that I will never see my husband again.

---

### MARMEE:

Meg, darling, listen. This is just the time you’re in.

---

Young married people are apt to grow apart at the very moment when they ought to be most together.

---

Don’t shut him out of the nursery, but teach him how to help in it.

---

And don’t shut yourself up because you are a woman,

---

but talk with him, exchange ideas, and help each other. All will be well, my dear.

---

### MEG:

Can you do the jelly next time?

---

### MARMEE:

We’ll do it together.

---

### MEG:

Thank youuuuuu.

---

### LAURIE:

Hello, ladies. I was hoping Jo might join me for a walk this afternoon?

---

### JO:

Uhhh -

### BETH:

Of course she will!

---

### MARMEE:

She was just saying how much she wanted to be outside

---

### LAURIE:

Jo?

---

### JO:

A… walk would be just the thing.

---

### LAURIE:

Good. Very good.

---

### JO:

Teddy.

### LAURIE:

Jo, listen -

---

### JO:

No, Teddy. Please don’t -

### LAURIE:

I will and you must hear me,

---

Jo, it’s no use, we’ve got to have it out and it has got to be now, listen to me -

---

### JO:

No, Teddy, I already know what you’re going to say -

---

### LAURIE:

Jo March I have loved you ever since I’ve known you.

---

Couldn’t help it. And I’ve tried to show it again and again, but you wouldn’t let me.

---

### JO:

Because I wanted to save you this.

---

I never wanted to make you care for me so, and I went away to keep you from it!

---

### LAURIE:

Well brava, it only made me love you all the more!

---

I worked hard to please you, and I gave up billiards and everything you didn’t like,

---

and waited and never complained, because I hoped you’ll love me,

---

though I’m not half good enough for you!

---

### JO:

But you are, you’re a great deal too good for me,

---

and I’m so grateful to you, and so proud and fond of you, and I…

---

### LAURIE:

What? You what?

---

### JO:

I don’t know why I can’t love you as you want me to.

---

I’ve tried, but I can’t change the feeling, and it would be a lie to say I do when I… don’t.

---

### LAURIE:

You… don’t. Really? Truly?

---

### JO:

Really. Truly.

---

### JO:

Teddy, I’m sorry, so desperately sorry,

---

I could kill myself if it would do any good! But I can’t help it.

---

You know it’s impossible for people to make themselves love other people if they don’t.

---

### LAURIE:

They do sometimes.

---

### JO:

Well not that’s the right sort of love, and I’d rather not try it.

---

### LAURIE:

“There was a long pause, while a blackbird sang, and the tall grass rustled.”

---

### JO:

Laurie, I do want to tell you something -

### LAURIE:

Don’t, Jo, I can’t bear it -

---

### JO:

What?

### LAURIE:

Tell me that you love that old man.

---

### JO:

What old man?

---

### LAURIE:

That devilish Professor you were always writing about.

---

If you want Shakespeare I can get you Shakespere! My library will be yours!

---

### JO:

(offended) Teddy.

### LAURIE:

If you say you love him, I swear I’ll do something desperate.

---

### JO:

Oh stop, Teddy, he isn’t devilish, he’s the best friend I’ve got next to you.

---

### LAURIE:

Oh now he’s next to me is he?!

---

### JO:

Don’t fly into a passion! I’m trying to be kind, but I going to get angry if you abuse my Professor.

---

### LAURIE:

Your professor? Yours?! You do love him, I know it.

---

### JO:

No I don’t,

---

I haven’t the least idea of loving him or anybody else!

---

### LAURIE:

But you will after a while, and then what will become of me?

---

### JO:

You’ll love someone else -

---

### LAURIE:

I can’t love anyone else, Jo, never.

---

### JO:

Laurie, stop. I agree with Mother - that you and I are not suited to each other,

---

### LAURIE:

Your mother?!

### JO:

we don’t agree and we never shall,

---

### JO:

so we’ll be good friends all our lives, if you will just be reasonable -

---

### LAURIE:

I don’t want to be reasonable, I want you, but you haven’t got any heart!

---

### JO:

I wish I hadn’t. You’ll see that I’m right and thank me for it -

---

### LAURIE:

I’ll be hanged if I do!

### JO:

TEDDY, STOP THIS RIGHT NOW.

---

You’ll find some lovely accomplished girl, who will adore you, and make a fine mistress for your fine house.

---

I wouldn’t. I’m homely and awkward and odd, and you’d be ashamed of me,

---

and we would quarrel—we can’t help it even now!

---

—and I wouldn’t like elegant society and you would, and you’d hate my scribbling

---

and I couldn’t get on without it, and we would be unhappy,

---

and wish we hadn’t done it, and everything would be horrid.

---

### LAURIE:

Anything more?

### JO:

No.

---

Except -

### LAURIE:

(hopeful)What.

---

### JO:

Except that I don’t believe I shall ever marry. Anyone.

---

I’m happy as I am, and love my liberty too well to give it up for any mortal man.

---

### LAURIE:

I’m crushed that you think of me as mortal.

---

### JO:

I’m being quite serious!

### LAURIE:

So am I.

---

And you think you can’t marry anyone now, but there’ll come a time when you will care for somebody,

---

and you’ll love him tremendously and I shall have to stand by and see it.

---

### JO:

ALRIGHT I’VE DONE MY BEST BUT YOU WON’T BE REASONABLE,

---

AND IT’S SELFISH OF YOU TO KEEP TEASING FOR SOMETHING I CAN’T GIVE,

---

I SHALL ALWAYS BE FOND OF YOU, AS A FRIEND,

---

BUT I’LL NEVER MARRY YOU AND THE SOONER YOU BELIEVE IT THE BETTER FOR BOTH OF US!

---

### LAURIE:

“That speech was like gunpowder.“

### JO:

Where are you going?

---

### LAURIE:

To the devil!

---

### LAURIE:

Can’t you, Jo?

---

### JO:

I wish I could.

---

### LAURIE:

It’s all right, never mind.

---

### JO:

“But. It wasn’t all right. And Jo did mind.

---

For she felt as if she had stabbed her dearest friend,

---

and when he left her without a look behind, she knew that the boy Laurie would never come again.”

---

### LAURIE:

“Because he didn’t go to the devil. He went to Europe.”

---

### JO:

Laurie… Laurie…

---

### AMY:

Laurie? Laurie! Theodore Laurence, is it really you?

---

### LAURIE:

Amy? What on earth are you doing in - where am I?

---

### AMY:

Nice.

---

### LAURIE:

Nice. Yes. Here I am in Nice. And here you are. And how… lovely.

---

### AMY:

Indeed, what a wonder to find you.

---

And how is your grandfather? When did you come?

---

### LAURIE:

He’s very well—last night – long trip. You look different.

---

### AMY:

I am different! A year over here and I’m a new woman!

---

Oh I have so much to tell you, I don’t know where to begin!

---

Aunt March keeps me busy with painting and drawing lessons, sketching great works of art,

---

meeting so many people, so many parties, oh

---

and Fred Vaughn will likely propose, but I don’t know -

---

### LAURIE:

Propose?

### AMY:

Yes.

---

### LAURIE:

To you?

### AMY:

Yes.

---

### LAURIE:

To marry?

### AMY:

Yes, Laurie.

---

Nevermind, the most important matter is news of Beth.

---

Mother says that she is very poorly, and I think I ought to go home,

---

but they all say ‘stay,’ what do you think?

---

### LAURIE:

I think that it is a great comfort to them to know that you are well

---

and happy, and enjoying so much, my dear.

---

### AMY:

“He smiled and Amy’s heart was lightened,”

---

### LAURIE:

“for the way he said”

### AMY:

“‘my dear’,”

---

### LAURIE:

“seemed to assure her that if any trouble did come,”

---

### AMY:

“she would not be alone in a strange land.”

---

### LAURIE:

“And neither would he.”

---

[Music Transition]

---

[Beth plays a trill on the piano]

### JO:

That sounds so much like your birds out there.

---

They love you so.

---

### BETH:

It’s how I tell them how much I love them back.

---

[Beth plays the trill again]
Now you can tell them too.

---

[Beth plays the trill again]
Mother said the birds reminded her of me, but I see all of us in them.

---

You are the gull, strong and wild, fond of the storm,

---

flying far out to sea, and happy all alone.

---

Meg is the turtledove, beautiful and happy cooing at home,

---

and Amy is like the lark, trying to get up among the clouds.

---

I hope I shall see her again, but she seems so far away.

---

### JO:

Of course you will! Amy will be back in the spring.

---

I’m going to have you well and rosy by that time.

---

### BETH:

Jo. Don’t…

---

I don’t want you to… hope any more. It won’t do any good.

---

### JO:

Hope is always good! Bethy, come now, don’t think that way -

---

### BETH:

Jo, I’m saying that it isn’t hard to think of. Or to bear.

---

I’ve known it for a good while and now I’m used to it.

---

### JO:

Beth, please stop this no -

### BETH:

Listen to me,

---

we’ll have such happy times while we can, I don’t suffer much, and I think the tide will go out easily.

---

### JO:

No, Beth, the tide? You must get well.

---

### BETH:

I want to so much, of course I do.

---

But every day I lose a little. When the tide turns it goes slowly, but it can’t be stopped.

---

### JO:

It shall be stopped.

---

I’ll work and pray and fight against it. It can’t be too late, it’s not too late.

---

God won’t be so cruel as to take you from me.

---

### BETH:

“Beth did not rebuke Jo with saintly speeches,

---

only loved her better for her passionate affection.

---

She could not say, “I’m glad to go,” for life was very sweet for her.

---

She could only hold fast to her sister.”

---

### JO:

“Jo never left her for even an hour.”

---

[Beth plays again, it is remarkably beautiful]

---

### BETH:

You must take my place, and be everything to Father and Mother when I’m gone.

---

They will turn to you, don’t fail them,

---

and if it’s hard to work alone,

---

remember that I don’t forget you

---

for love is the only thing that we can carry with us when we go,

---

and it makes the end…

---

easy.

---

### JO:

I’ll try. I will.

[Beth playing slows]

---

### MEG:

“So the spring days came and went,”

---

### MARMEE:

“the sky grew clearer,”

---

### JO:

“the earth greener, “

---

### BETH:

“and the birds came back to say goodbye…”

---

[Beth stops playing at last]

---

### JO:

“You see. Seldom except in books do the dying utter memorable words.”

---

### BETH:

“As Beth had hoped, the ‘tide went out easily.’”

---

---

### JO:

“When morning came, for the first time in many months the fire was out.

---

And the room was terribly still.”

[A bird chirps]

---

“But the spring sunshine streamed in like a benediction.”

[Jo plays the trill Beth taught her]

---

### MARMEE:

“Dark days”

### JO:

“Ceaseless longing.”

---

### MEG:

“Quiet house.”

---

### MARMEE:

“Often Jo awoke at night,”

### JO:

“thinking Beth called her. But no.”

---

### MEG:

“Now, if she had been the heroine of a moral storybook,”

---

### MARMEE:

“she ought to have become quite saintly.”

---

### JO:

“But Jo wasn’t a heroine,”

---

### MEG:

“she was only a struggling human girl like so many others.”

---

### MARMEE:

Why don’t you write, Jo? That always makes you happy?

---

### JO:

I’ve no heart to write, and if I had, nobody cares.

---

### MARMEE:

We do. Write something for us, and never mind the rest of the world.

---

### MEG:

“For once Jo listened to her mother the first time.”

---

### JO:

“And wrote for and about her family of little women.”

---

### MARMEE:

“And she was so happy that even when Amy and Laurie wrote of their engagement -”

---

### JO:

I'm Sorry What?

### MARMEE:

Well yes,

---

Amy and Laurie just wrote that they intend to marry -

---

### JO:

Amy and Laurie?

### MARMEE:

Yes, dear

---

### JO:

Teddy and Amy?

### MEG:

Yes, Jo

---

### JO:

Sorry, did you say engaged?!

### MARMEE:

It seems so, though I suspected as much.

---

### JO:

You suspected? You never said.

---

Why did you never say “Jo, your best friend is going to marry your little sister?”

---

### MARMEE:

Because Mothers have sharp eyes and discrete tongues when they have girls to manage.

---

And I was afraid it might pain you to hear it.

---

### JO:

(lying, sort of, very confused)I am not pained! I am baffled!

---

Alright - Well - This is… this is fine, this is good. It is better this way.

---

I refused him, of course. So I’m glad that Amy learned to - to love - him.

---

Him? Really? Laurie?

---

### MARMEE:

The ring would indicate as much. And truthfully, I think they might be a good pair.

---

### JO:

Well I would hope so now that they are paired.

---

It’s just that… just that… now I find myself so… so lonely.

---

I wonder… If Teddy had tried again I just might have said yes.

---

### MARMEE:

Jo, no -

### JO:

Not because I love him that way

---

but because I care more to be loved.

---

Suddenly. Or I am starting to understand the point of it.

---

### MARMEE:

Of what?

---

### JO:

Husbands?

---

### MARMEE:

Yes well. One day you will be as happy as Amy, who writes that she never knew

---

“how like heaven this world could be when two people love and live for each - “

---

### JO:

(interrupting her) That’s Fantastic So Happy For Them, I’m Gonna Go I Need To Write Something Tragic.

---

### MARMEE:

“And Jo closed the letter as one might shut the covers of a lovely romance, which holds the reader fast till the end,”

---

### JO:

“and one finds oneself alone in the real world again.”

---

### MEG:

“A restless spirit possessed her.”

---

### JO:

“For weeks.”

---

### MARMEE:

“Amy’s happiness woke the hungry longing for someone to ‘love with heart and soul.”

---

### JO:

An old maid, that’s what I’m to be.

---

A literary spinster, with a pen for a spouse, a family of stories,

---

and a morsel of fame, perhaps.

---

You know, old maids are very comfortable when they get used to it.

---

### MARMEE:

“Jo’s unquiet wanderings always ended with her clutching a book.”

### MEG:

Shakespeare, of course.

---

## JO:

“Which is when out slipped a little message written in the Professor’s hand from some time ago.”

---

### MARMEE:

“Which said only this… “

---

### BHAER:

“Wait for me, my friend. I may be a little late, but I shall surely come.”

---

[Jo Sobs]

---

### MARMEE:

“Was it all loneliness? “

---

### MEG:

“Or was it the waking up of a sentiment which had bided its time as patiently as its inspirer?”

---

### JO:

“Who shall say?”

---

### LAURIE:

I will.

---

### JO:

Oh my, Teddy! Teddy?!

### LAURIE:

Here’s my Jo in the flesh!

---

### JO:

What are you doing here, I thought you were in Europe?

---

### LAURIE:

We were, now we’re not, now we’re here! You’re… glad to see me, then?

---

### JO:

Glad!? Yes, of course! I’m so delighted. Where’s Amy?

---

### LAURIE:

Your mother has got her down at Meg’s.

---

We stopped there on the way and there was no getting my wife out of their clutches.

---

### JO:

Your what? Laurie -

### LAURIE:

Now I’ve done it.

---

### JO:

You’ve gone and got married!

### LAURIE:

Very much so, thank you.

---

### JO:

Well what dreadful thing will you do next?

---

### LAURIE:

A characteristic, but not exactly complimentary congratulation.

---

Don’t I look like a married man and the head of a family?

---

### JO:

Not a bit, and you never will.

---

When, where, how? Tell me everything.

---

### LAURIE:

Six weeks ago at the American consul’s in Paris, a very quiet wedding of course,

---

for even in our happiness we didn’t forget dear little Beth.

---

I’m so sorry we left you to bear it all alone.

---

### JO:

Well. The thought of you and Amy, safe and…

---

happy made everything easier to bear.

---

### LAURIE:

Jo, I want to say one thing, and then we’ll put it by forever.

---

### JO:

You needn’t, Laurie, really -

### LAURIE:

One thing.

---

As I told you in my letter I never shall… stop loving you,

---

but the love is altered. Amy and you changed places in my heart, that’s all.

---

I think it would have come about naturally if I had waited, as you tried to make me,

---

but I never could be patient, and I was a boy then, headstrong and making a fool of myself.

---

But when I saw her in France, everything seemed to clear up all at once,

---

and you both got into your right places.

---

### JO:

I believe it. I see the change in you, and you’ll find it in me too.

---

We will be brother and sister, to love and help one another all our lives, won’t we?

---

### LAURIE:

“He did not say a word,”

### JO:

“but took the hand she offered him,”

---

### LAURIE:

“and laid his face down on it for a minute.”

---

### AMY:

Where is she? Where’s my dear Jo?

---

### JO:

Now if she abuses you, come to me and I’ll defend you.

---

### JO:

Amy is married!

### AMY:

My darling Jo! Mrs. Laurence You’re not mad?

---

### LAURIE:

“How they did talk.”

---

### AMY:

“First one,”

### MEG:

“then the other,”

---

### JO:

“then all burst out together—”

### MARMEE:

“trying to tell the history of three years in half an hour.”

---

### MEG:

“Jo watched the pair,”

---

### AMY:

“Laurie and Amy!”

---

### LAURIE:

“Amy and Laurie.”

---

### JO:

“And thought: How well they look together.”

---

### MEG:

You look like you could use something sweet.

---

### JO:

The jelly gelled, did it?

### MEG:

The jelly gelled.

---

Just took a bit of time… and clarity.

---

### MARMEE:

Jo, would you mind?

### JO:

Of course, of course. Coming!

---

### BHAER:

“And there stood a tall bearded gentleman,”

---

### JO:

“beaming at her from the darkness like a midnight sun.”

---

### BHAER:

Miss March, good evening.

### JO:

Mr. … Bhaer?

---

### BHAER:

Yes, but you have a party, I am so sorry, excuse my intrusion -

---

### JO:

NoNoNo, I am so glad to see you!

---

We only have family, My sister and best friend have just come home, and we are all very happy.

---

Come in, and make us moreso!

---

Everyone, this is my friend from New York, Mr. Professor Friedrich Bhaer!

---

### MARMEE:

“Jo said, with a face and tone of such irrepressible pride that she might as well have blown a trumpet.”

---

### AMY:

Welcome, hello!

### MARMEE:

We are so grateful to have you.

---

### BHAER:

Thank you, thank you - all.

---

### LAURIE:

Hello. Professor.

### BHAER:

Well one of many. In the area. I would think.

---

### JO:

“Laurie’s behavior had a faint twinge of jealousy - “

---

### LAURIE:

“Suspicion”

### AMY:

Seems like jealousy

---

### LAURIE:

It is brotherly circumspection and you’re welcome.

---

### AMY:

Uh huh, drop it.

### LAURIE:

My wife and I are very glad to meet you, sir.

---

### BHAER:

Oh, your -? Very good. And thank you and your wife, very much indeed.

---

### MARMEE:

What do you think?

### MEG:

He’s perfect for her.

---

### MARMEE:

Does she see it?

### MEG:

Absolutely not.

---

### JO:

I wish there was music tonight. We are all together again and we should be singing.

---

### MARMEE:

“They were - of course - not all together.”

---

### MEG:

“But Beth’s beloved instrument, seldom touched now, seemed to say,”

---

### VOICE:

“Be happy. I am here.”

---

### LAURIE:

Play something, Amy. Let them hear how much you have improved!

---

### AMY:

Not now, dear. I can’t show off tonight.

### JO:

Love does work miracles.

---

### BHAER:

You will sing with me then, my friend? We go excellently well together.

---

### MARMEE & MEG:

Excellently well together!

---

### AMY:

“This was a pleasing fiction for Jo had no more idea of music than a grasshopper.”

---

### JO:

“So he sang in German to the whole room

---

lingering on the final refrain that she remembered translated to: ”

---

### BHAER:

“There, oh there, might I with thee, O, my beloved, go.”

---

### BHAER:

I shall gladly come again, if I may. A little business will keep me here some days.

---

### JO:

Then. Yes. Come again.

---

### LAURIE:

That man intends to marry our Jo!

---

### AMY:

I hope so, don’t you?

---

### LAURIE:

I do wish he was a little younger and a good deal richer.

---

### AMY:

Now, Laurie, women should never marry for money -
[Laurie burst out laughing]

---

### AMY:

What?! Don’t laugh at me, I forgot you were rich when I said ‘Yes’.

---

I’d have married you without a penny!

### LAURIE:

I'm glad you did

---

### JO:

“That night Jo wondered what the business was that brought Mr. Bhaer to Concord.”

---

### BHAER:

“If she had seen his face when, safe in his room,

---

he looked at the picture of a severe young lady gazing into futurity,

---

it might have thrown some light upon the subject,

---

especially when he kissed the picture in the dark.”

---

### MARMEE:

“By the second week, everyone knew perfectly well what was going on,

---

yet everyone tried to look as if they were stone-blind to it.”

---

### MEG:

“For a fortnight, the Professor came and went with lover-like regularity.”

---

### JO:

“They walked together every day, across the meadows and down the roads of Concord.”

---

### BHAER:

“They talked of literature and learning,”

### JO:

“Family and the future.”

---

### BHAER:

“And then - “

### JO:

“And then - “

---

### AMY:

“And then he stayed away for three whole days!”

---

### JO:

It’s nothing to me, of course,

---

but I should think he would have at least bid us goodbye like a gentleman.

---

### MARMEE:

You’d better take the umbrella, dear. It looks like rain.

---

### MEG:

And you have on your new bonnet.

---

### MARMEE:

If you happen to meet Mr. Bhaer, bring him home to tea. I quite long to see the dear man.

---

### JO:

Oh I’m quite sure he’s gone now. As am I. Goodbye.

---

### JO:

“When she got to town and had her arms full with the shopping She remembered the umbrella she had forgotten.”

---

[Thunder cracks]

---

### JO:

No. Jo. You shall not go there to borrow an umbrella, or find out where he is, from his friends.

---

You shall trudge away, and do your errands in the rain,

---

and if you catch your death and ruin your bonnet, it’s no more than you deserve.

---

### BHAER:

I had to know the strong-minded lady who goes so bravely and so fast through so much mud.

---

What are you doing in town, my friend? And with no umbrella.

---

### JO:

Shopping. Obviously.

---

### BHAER:

May I take your packages for you?

---

### JO:

Oh. Well, thank you.

### BHAER:

And you are headed back?

---

### JO:

Yes but I can walk. I’m used to… trudging.

### BHAER:

So am I.

---

### JO:

We thought you had gone.

---

### BHAER:

I have… not.

---

Did you believe that I should go with no farewell to those who have been so kind to me?

---

### JO:

I knew you were busy, but we rather… missed you, Father and Mother especially.

---

### BHAER:

And you?

### JO:

…I’m always glad to see a friend, sir.

---

### BHAER:

“ the frosty monosyllable at the end chilled the Professor, for his smile vanished.”

---

### JO:

“In her anxiety to keep her voice calm, Jo sounded rather too cool

---

but she was unskilled in such things.”

---

### BHAER:

Ah. Well. I will come one more time before I go. To thank your Father and Mother.

---

### JO:

You are going, then?

---

### BHAER:

My friends have found me a place in a college where I will teach as I did at home.

---

### JO:

Oh! How splendid it will be to have you teaching, and be able to see you often!

---

### BHAER:

Not so often. The place is in the West.

---

### JO:

New York?

---

### BHAER:

California.

---

### JO:

Oh. That is… so very West.

---

### BHAER:

“Mr. Bhaer could read several languages, but not women.”

---

### JO:

“He was going away, which meant that only cared for her as a friend,

---

which meant it was all a mistake, all of it, and the sooner it was over the better.”

---

### BHAER:

“Jo blinked hard - “

---

### JO:

“because she would have died rather than openly wipe her eyes.”

---

### BHAER:

“But he suddenly saw everything.”

Heart’s dearest, why do you cry?

---

### JO:

“Now, if Jo had not been new to this sort of thing she would have said she wasn’t crying,

---

but she was an undignified creature and so she sobbed - “ Because you are going away.

---

### BHAER:

Ach, mein Gott, that is so good, Jo! I have nothing but much love to give you,

---

I came to see if you could care for it, and I waited to be sure that I was something more than a friend,

---

### JO:

As did I! I waited for you!

### BHAER:

You did? So I am more to you?

---

### JO:

Yes!

---

### BHAER:

Can you make a little placein your heart for me?

---

### JO:

Yes!

---

### JO:

“She looked far from lovely, with her skirts deplorable, rubber boots splashed, bonnet ruined.”

---

### BHAER:

“Fortunately, Mr. Bhaer considered her the most beautiful woman living.”

---

### BHAER:

I have… nothing to give but a full heart and these empty hands.

---

### JO:

Not empty now.

---

### AMY:

“and she kissed her Friedrich -

### MEG:

“under the umbrella!”

---

### JO:

“And turning from the night and storm and loneliness”

---

### BHAER:

“to the household light and warmth and peace”

---

### MARMEE:

“waiting to receive them.”

### JO:

Welcome home!

---

### LAURIE:

“Jo said “

### JO:

“and led her love in.”

---

### AMY:

“Led her love in.

### MEG:

“Led her love in.”

---

### BHAER:

“Let her love in.”

---

### MARMEE:

“Let her love in “

---

### MEG:

“The end…”

---

### AMY:

“The end…“

---

### LAURIE:

“The… “

### JO / LOUISA:

End.

---

### BETH:

Well done.

### LOUISA / JO:

You think?

---

### BETH:

Well the book hasn’t gone out of print since 1868, so… yes. People love it. Mostly Laurie.

---

### LOUISA / JO:

They’re not mad that Jo didn’t end up with him?

---

### BETH:

Oh they are very mad.

---

### AMY:

But they forgive you with that umbrella bit at the end with the Professor?!. Ughhhh, I love that part.

---

### MEG:

So do I. Very romantic, Lu.

---

### LOUISA / JO:

Stop. It’s not a romance!

### BETH:

Yes it issss

---

### MARMEE:

It is. And “the triumph of the century” according to your publisher.

---

### BETH:

And while Lu’s sister Beth never got to read the book that immortalized her,

---

she has no doubt that her sister wrote her well.

---

### MARMEE:

And when Lu’s mother dies a decade after her daughter’s book swept the world,

---

she is known as the inspiration for the kindest mother in western literature.

---

### MEG:

When Lu’s sister Anna loses her husband, she and her children come to live with Lu

---

and the book pays to support them for the rest of their lives.

---

### AMY:

When Lu’s youngest sister May, a tremendous artist in her own right, a painter, in fact…

---

when May dies far too young, childbirth, her big sister’s book supports her little girl,

---

who comes to live with her very famous aunt. After whom she is named.

---

### BETH:

Well done.

---

### MEG:

Well done.

---

### AMY:

Well done.

---

### MARMEE:

Well done, my girl.

---

### BETH:

Read the last bit again, won’t you Lu?

---

### LOUISA / JO:

Oh course, my loves.

---

My wild, strange, hilarious, brave, wonderful women.

---

“‘Welcome home!’ Jo said and led her love in, and shut the door.”

---

The End
