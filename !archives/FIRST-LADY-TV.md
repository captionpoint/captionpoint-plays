## MOLLY:
Hello everybody. Oy, you'll have to excuse me. I'm so busy. Everybody is so busy. 

---

There's so much going on.

---

## MOLLY:
Tomorrow is the Fourth of July so everybody is getting ready. 

---

You'd think, maybe, because it's a holiday, people would take it easy, but for the Fourth of July holiday, 

---

there's parades and picnics and celebrations for the freedoms we have in our country.

---

## MOLLY:
Because, you know, the Founding Fathers came to this country for freedom just like so many families came after them. 

---

So many families. You know, our family and the O'Reillys on the second floor and the Capezios on the fifth floor. 

---

Everyone came for freedom.

---

## MOLLY:
Now everybody is an American and every American can do what they want. 

---

Some Americans want caffeine in their coffee, and some Americans don't want caffeine in their coffee.

---

## MOLLY:
And if you're like me and you don't want caffeine in your coffee, thank goodness, there's Sanka coffee 

---

because Sanka has ninety-seven percent of the caffeine taken out and they leave in the sleep.

---

## MOLLY:
The Fourth of July fireworks may keep you awake with all the noise and the lights but what won't keep you awake is Sanka Coffee. 

---

And, you know you can get it instant or regular and it's the only instant in the whole market.

---

## MOLLY:
In the whole market. And a couple of teaspoons and one/two/three with a little boiling water you have a cup of coffee.

---

It's delicious. It's economical. So what if it's a penny more. What is a penny? 

---

A drop in the ocean.

---

## MOLLY:
Like the ocean where the Founding Fathers sailed over to come to America. 

---

I can only imagine how rocky was the boat on the ocean, how much they tossed and they turned and if you feel that way like I do sometimes, 

---

you'll drink Sanka, you'll feel better. Trust me.

---

## MOLLY:
Now, you'll have to excuse me because in a minute Sammy and Rosalie will be home 

---

and Jake will be home from work, so I have to get ready. 

---

Excuse me.

---

## MOLLY:
David, thank you for helping me with the decorations.

---

## DAVID:
I’m helping. I’m helping. What am I going to be? Not helping?

---

## MOLLY:
A couple more streamers, think, and then we’ll do the bunting.

---

## DAVID:
Bunting? We’re playing baseball?

---

## MOLLY:
No, David. This is bunting. Bunting is what you hang around the doorway and the windows.

---

## DAVID:
I only know bunting from baseball.

---

## SAMMY:
Hello, Ma.

---

## MOLLY:
Hello, Sammy, darling.

---

## SAMMY:
Hi, Uncle David.

---

## DAVID:
Hello, Sammy.

---

## SAMMY:
Here are the blueberries you wanted.

---

## MOLLY:
Thank you, Sammy.

---

## MOLLY:
And the strawberries?

---

## SAMMY:
Oh, gee. I forgot the strawberries.

---

## MOLLY:
Sammy, please. Go back to the store. Ask Mr. Steinberg for a pound of strawberries. 

---

## SAMMY:
Okay, Ma. Why do you need both blueberries and strawberries?

---

## MOLLY:
For the Fourth of July tomorrow, I want for dinner to make good American food. 

---

So I’m going to make red, white, and blue blintzes.

---

## SAMMY:
Okay, Ma.

---

## MOLLY:
David, you think this is enough decorations?

---

## DAVID:
I think it’s enough.

---

## MOLLY:
Look at me. I’m a Dandy Yankee Doodle.

---

## ROSALIE:
Hello, Ma, Darling.

---

## MOLLY:
Hello, Darling.

---

## ROSALIE:
Hello, Uncle David.

---

## DAVID:
Hello, Rosalie.

---

## ROSALIE:
Oh, Ma. The decorations look great.

---

## MOLLY:
Oh, thank you. Thank you. Uncle David helped me.

---

## DAVID:
I helped.

---

## ROSALIE:
Ma. Guess what?

---

## MOLLY:
What?

---

## ROSALIE:
I saw a sign at the American Legion Hall. 

---

There’s a contest for someone to write the best essay about one of the founding fathers.

---

## MOLLY:
One of the founding fathers? That’s very interesting.

---

## ROSALIE:
Whoever writes the best essay wins fifty dollars.

---

## MOLLY:
Fifty dollars? Oh, my. Fifty dollars, did you say?

---

## ROSALIE:
Do you think I could write an essay, Ma?

---

## MOLLY:
An essay? Of, course, Rosalie, Darling.

---

## ROSALIE:
I’m going to get started on it right away. 

---

Do you think Sammy will let me use his encyclopedia?

---

## MOLLY:
You’ll ask him. When he comes back from the store, you’ll ask him.

---

## SAMMY:
Here are the strawberries, Ma.

---

## MOLLY:
Oh, thank you, Sammy.

---

## ROSALIE:
Sammy, can I use your encyclopedia?

---

## SAMMY:
Sure. I guess. What for?

---

## MOLLY:
She’s writing an essay.

---

## SAMMY:
An essay? It’s the Fourth of July. There’s no school.

---

## ROSALIE:
I’m going to write an essay about one of the founding fathers and win fifty dollars.

---

## SAMMY:
Fifty dollars?! Gee.

---

## MOLLY:
How about that, Sammy? So you’ll help your sister? 

---

## SAMMY: 
It’s a holiday!

---

## MOLLY:
Tomorrow, it’s a holiday. Tonight, you can help your sister.

---

## SAMMY:
There’s a dance at the school gym tonight. I have to practice my dancing.

---

## ROSALIE:
I can help you with your dancing.

---

## MOLLY:
So there you go.


---


You'll help him with the dancing.


---


You'll help her with the essay.

---

## SAMMY:

Okay.

---

## ROSALIE:

Okay.

---

## MOLLY:
David, you’ll come to the kitchen and help me with the blintzes. 

---

## DAVID:
I’ll help you with the blintzes.

---

## ROSALIE:
I know why you’re going to the dance tonight.

---

## SAMMY:
You do? 

---

## ROSALIE:
Because Carol Ann Stepansky’s going to be there. I know you like her.

---

## SAMMY:
Can you help me?

---

## ROSALIE:
Sure. Stand in front of me.

---

## ROSALIE:
Stand straight. Come on. No slumping. Shoulders back. 

---

Left hand out so she can rest her hand in yours. 

---

Put your right hand right here.

---

## SAMMY:
Gee!

---

## ROSALIE:
Now, follow me. With your left foot, step forward... 

---

Bring your right foot up and to the side... That’s it... 

---

Then bring your left foot together with the right... 

---

Good... Now, take a step back with the right...

---

Then your left leg to the side... 

---

And bring your feet together... Again. Forward... 

---

Side... Together... Back... Side... Together... 

---

Got it?

---

## SAMMY:
I don’t know.

---

## ROSALIE:
Let’s try it with music.

---

## ROSALIE:
Forward... Side... Together... Back... Side... Together... 

---

Forward... Side... Together... Back... Side... Together.

---

## SAMMY:
What about this?

---

## MOLLY:
Oh!

---
template: noise
There is a knock at the door.

---
template: noise
The knock gets louder.

---

## MOLLY:
Oh! Oh! Someone’s knocking. Rosalie, please. Turn off the music.

---

## MOLLY:
Jake.

---

## MOLLY:
Oh, Jake.

---

## JAKE:
How long does a person have to knock on a door? I couldn’t reach my keys. 

---

I had to kick the door with my foot.

---

## MOLLY:
Jake. Come in.

---

## ROSALIE:
Hi, Pa.

---

## SAMMY:
Hi, Pa.

---

## JAKE:
Would somebody help me, please?

---

## GERTRUDE: 
Wait a minute.

---

## PHILIP:
What?

---

## GERTRUDE:
Wait. Hold out the dresses.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Walt.

---

## WALTER:
Hold, please.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Phil should be holding more dresses. We need more dresses. 

---

## WALTER:
Yes, Mrs. Berg.

---

## PHILIP:
Why do I need more dresses?

---

## GERTRUDE:
You need more dresses.

---

## PHILIP:
Why do I need more dresses?

---

## GERTRUDE:
It’s funnier if you have more dresses.

---

## PHILIP:
It doesn’t make sense.

---

## GERTRUDE:
It doesn’t have to make sense.

---

## PHILIP:
I only have one day off. Why would I bring home so many dresses?

---

## GERTRUDE:
You’re going to explain it in minute. You’re anxious. You’re upset.

---

## PHILIP:
Yes.

---

## GERTRUDE:
You’re a man short in the shop so you’re anxious and upset.

---

## PHILIP:
Yes.

---

## GERTRUDE:
So you’re not thinking clearly. You’re going to bring home as many dresses as you can carry. 

---

All right?

---

## PHILIP:
All right.

---

## GERTRUDE:
All right.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Walter. We need more dresses.

---

## PHILIP:
Wait a minute. What if I bring in just one dress? 

---

A special dress? I could bring it in like this. 

---

Like I’m carrying Cordelia. 

---

I could even go Howl! Howl!

---

## GERTRUDE:
Who knows “howl, howl, howl?”

---

## PHILIP:
I do.

---

## GERTRUDE:
You do. The Goldbergs don’t know from “howl, howl, howl.”  We need more dresses.

---

## WALTER:
Any particular style?

---

## GERTRUDE:
Bring an assortment.

---

## WALTER:
Different colors? Different fabrics?

---

## GERTRUDE:
Yes. The more, the better.

---

## WALTER:
How many do you want? Ten? Twenty?

---

## GERTRUDE:
The more, the better.

---

## WALTER:
All right.

---

Take five, everyone.

---

## ELI:
Do I have time for a smoke?

---

## WALTER:
Take seven, everyone.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Phil.

---

## ARLENE:
Mrs. Berg?

---

## GERTRUDE:
Yes, Arlene.

---

## ARLENE:
Have you had a chance to...?

---

## GERTRUDE:
Had a chance to?

---

## GERTRUDE:
What?

---

## ARLENE:
Have you read what I wrote?

---

## GERTRUDE:
I haven’t. I’m sorry.

---

## PHILIP:
What are you writing?

---

## ARLENE:
The George Washington essay. I asked Mrs. Berg if I could write it.  

---

I so appreciate this.

---

## PHILIP:
What’s wrong with...?

---

## ARLENE:
I don’t feel it’s how Arlene would write it.

---

## PHILIP:
You don’t feel...?

---

## ARLENE:
I left it for you.

---

## GERTRUDE:
I’m sorry. There’s a lot going on.

---

## ARLENE:
If you would just take a look at it.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Yes. Yes. I will.When we get to it.

---

You and Larry should work on the dancing.

---

## ARLENE:
I don’t need to work on the dancing.

---

## GERTRUDE:
It’s going too fast. The “forward/side/together.” You can slow it down. 

---

We’ve got time.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Larry. Work on the dancing.

---

## ARLENE:
Will you please...?

---

## GERTRUDE:
Yes. Go.

---

## LARRY:
Mrs. Berg.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Yes, Larry. What?

---

## LARRY:
I do know how to dance.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Okay.

---

## LARRY:
If you ever want me to dance, do know how to dance.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Go on.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Phil.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Are you all right?

---

## PHILIP:
No. Are you all right?

---

## GERTRUDE:
No.

---

## PHILIP:
I don’t have to tell you I’m wondering if you know what you’re going to do.

---

## GERTRUDE:
I know.

---

## PHILIP:
You know what you’re going to do?

---

## GERTRUDE:
I know you don’t have to tell me.

---

## PHILIP:
How much time have you got?

---

## GERTRUDE:
I told them would tell them after the show.

---

## PHILIP:
The first show or after we do it for the west coast?

---

## GERTRUDE:
After the west coast.

---

## PHILIP:
I feel like a man on Death Row. I’m sitting here hoping I’m going to get a reprieve from the Governor.

---

## GERTRUDE:
You might. I’m expecting a phone call. I hope I get a phone call.

---

## PHILIP:
From who?

---

## GERTRUDE:
From God.

---

## PHILIP:
You’re on good speaking terms?

---

## GERTRUDE:
I left a message. I’m hoping he’ll return my call.

---

## WALTER:
We have the dresses, Mrs. Berg.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Oh. Good. Thank you.

---

## WALTER:
I’ll get Eli.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Walt.

---

## WALTER:
Yes?

---

## GERTRUDE:
I may get a phone call. Let me know right away. 

---

If I get a phone call, stop the rehearsal.

---

## WALTER: 
All right. I thought they were waiting for you to call them.

---

## GERTRUDE:
I hope to get this call before I make that call.

---

## WALTER:
I don’t know how you do it.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Believe me. I could do without it.

---

## WALTER:
At least they’re letting you make the choice. I assume you’ve heard about Jean Muir. 

---

## GERTRUDE:
Jean Muir?

---

## PHILIP:
What about Jean Muir?

---

## WALTER:
She got fired from “The Aldrich Family.”

---

## GERTRUDE:
What?

---

## PHILIP:
Oh, my god.

---

## GERTRUDE:
What happened?

---

## WALTER:
The network let her go.

---

## PHILIP:
Oh, god.

## GERTRUDE:
Oh, no.

---

## GERTRUDE:
When?

---

## WALTER:
Yesterday.

---

## PHILIP:
Because she’s in “Red Channels?”

---

## WALTER:
Officially, because she’s a “controversial personality.”

---

## GERTRUDE:
Oh, Jean. She must be devastated. I should call her.

---

## WALTER:
Uh...I wouldn’t advise that.

---

## GERTRUDE:
You wouldn’t...?

---

## WALTER:
Well, I mean, you do what you think is best, of course. 

---

But, right now  you have enough to deal with being associated with this one.

---

## PHILIP:
Because I’m a “controversial personality.”

---

## WALTER:
Yes, you are.

---

## PHILIP:
Wait a minute. Look. “The Aldrich Family” is NBC. We’re CBS. 

---

CBS is not going to tell Gertrude Berg what to do. 

---

## WALTER:
The networks will do what the sponsors tell them to do.

---

## PHILIP:
Who’s the sponsor for “The Aldrich Family?”

---

## WALTER:
General Foods.

---

## PHILIP & GERTRUDE:
General Foods.

---

## PHILIP:
What, they’re not selling enough cereal?

---

## WALTER:
Cereal...Sanka.... Frozen vegetables... No, they’re everywhere.

---

## PHILIP:
They’re afraid people are going to stop buying vegetables?

---

## WALTER:
Yes, they are, in fact. Thanks to our friend in Syracuse. 

---

Everybody up and down Madison Avenue has a copy of “Red Channels.” 

---

It’s like “Strangers on the Train.” Everybody’s reading it.

---

## PHILIP:
But we’re still number one, aren’t we?

---

## GERTRUDE:
Number one in our time slot. Nationally, we’re number two.

---

## PHILIP:
Who’s number one?

---

## GERTRUDE:
Milton Berle.

---

## PHILIP:
Milton Berle.

---

## WALTER:
Fuck Milton Berle.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Language.

---

## PHILIP:
Then why don’t they leave us alone?

---

## WALTER:
They’re afraid, man. Everybody’s afraid these days.

---

## PHILIP:
All they care about is making money.

---

## WALTER:
That’s right. And if supporting the blacklist is going to make them money, that’s what they’re going to do.

---

## PHILIP:
They’re not going to cancel this show.

---

## WALTER:
Not if the controversial personality is removed. 

---

“The Aldrich Family” is going on without Jean Muir. Removing just one person from “The Goldbergs -

---

## GERTRUDE:
Phil is not just one person.

---

## WALTER:
I know. I know. But the reality is, either you put one person out of work, or you put all of us out of work.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Why is it up to me?

---

## WALTER:
Because you created the show? Because you own the show? Because you are the show.

---

## PHILIP:
And no one is going to take it away from you.

---

## WALTER:
That, we don’t know.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Walter. What would you do?

---

## WALTER:
You’re asking me?

---

## GERTRUDE:
What would you do if you were me?

---

## WALTER:
One time, I was pinned down in a foxhole. My unit was waiting for me to tell them what to do. 

---

I said to myself, “Well, the next thing I do is either going to be very brave or very crazy.”

---

## GERTRUDE:
And which did you choose?

---

## WALTER:
I don’t remember. I’m here, so I guess I made the right choice. 

---

But all I was doing was battling Nazis. Are you going to take on the sponsors? And the network?

---

And the United States government?

---

## GERTRUDE:
I have until midnight tonight to decide.

---

## WALTER:
Well, shi...

Oot.

---

## WALTER:
Phil, you know I’ve always liked you.

---

## PHILIP:
It’s what gives me strength in times of trouble.

---

## WALTER:
I know it’s tough.

---

## PHILIP:
She’s going to take care of it.

---

Molly takes care of everything.

---

## WALTER:
Do the others know?

---

## GERTRUDE:
No. Do you think should tell them?

---

## WALTER:
I don’t know. Does the turkey want to know that tomorrow is Thanksgiving?

---

## GERTRUDE:
I don’t know.

---

## WALTER:
Well, we should finish rehearsal. I mean, we are doing a show tonight, right?

---

## GERTRUDE:
Yes.

---

## WALTER:
Do you need a minute?

---

## PHILIP:
No, I don’t need a minute. Forty years, I’m a professional actor. 

---

When I break the leg, any personal problems are put aside. Go back to your booth. 

---

We have a show to do.

---

## WALTER:
Okay then.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Walter. If get a phone call, stop. Stop everything. No matter what’s going on.

---

## WALTER:
Got it.

---

## ELI:
Are we rehearsing or what?

---

## GERTRUDE:
We have more dresses?

---

## ELI:
Yes. Yes. You got ton of dresses out here.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Let me see.

---

## PHILIP:
Where are the dresses? Give me the dresses.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Here. Come here.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Okay. That’s it.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Okay, Walt. Take it from when open the door.

---

## GERTRUDE:
On your toes, Darlings!

---

## WALTER:
And... Action.

---

## MOLLY:
Jake.

---

## MOLLY:
Oh, Jake.

---

## JAKE:

---

I had to kick the door with my foot.

---

## PHILIP:
Before or after would somebody help me please?

---

## GERTRUDE:
Before. Go again.

---

## JAKE:

---

The worst day I’ve ever had.

---

## DAVID:
You want should get you bicarbonate?

---

## JAKE:
Yes, David. Thank you. Thank you. I can feel it in my stomach I’m so upset.

---

## MOLLY:
Rosalie, darling. Set the table for dinner.

---

## ROSALIE:
Yes, Ma.

---

## MOLLY:
So tell me, Jake. Why do you come home with dresses?

---

## JAKE:
I have orders to fill. Tomorrow is a holiday. The shop is closed. 

---

But I have orders to fill. I have to finish the dresses myself.

---

## DAVID:
Here’s your bicarbonate.

---

## JAKE:
Thank you, David.

---

## MOLLY:
From one holiday, you fall so behind?

---

## JAKE:
We fell behind today. In the shop.

## MOLLY:

## JAKE:
Mr. Silverman.

---

## MOLLY:
Mr. Silverman?

---

## JAKE:
Mr. Silverman.

---

## MOLLY:
You’ve told me he’s one of your best men.

---

## JAKE:
He is.

---

## MOLLY:
So why did you fire him?

---

## JAKE:
When one of your workers He drops character.

---

## PHILIP:
I just got it. You wrote an episode about having to fire someone.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Yes, I did.

---

## PHILIP:
You think that’s funny?

---

## GERTRUDE:
It just came to me. 28. 10.

---

## PHILIP:
Very funny.

---

## JAKE:
When one of your workers...In front of your own eyes... 

---

Steals from you, you have to fire him.

---

## MOLLY:
You saw him with your own eyes?

---

## JAKE:
My secretary did.

---

## MOLLY:
You saw him with your secretary’s own eyes?

---

## JAKE:
She saw him. Walking out the front door. She called me. 

---

I got to him as he was driving away.

---

## MOLLY:
You called him -

---

## JAKE:
I called him. told him he’s fired.

---

## MOLLY:
There must be some reason.

---

## JAKE:
No! There is no reason for stealing.

---

## ROSALIE:
Table’s all set, Ma.

---

## MOLLY:
Thank you, Darling.

---

So, Jake...Did you tell your partner?

---

## JAKE:
Mendel is out of town. He’s already at Pincus Pines for the holiday.

---

## ROSALIE:
I wish we could go to Pincus Pines.

---

## JAKE:
Not everyone gets a holiday, young lady. 

---

Some people have to work so that we have a place to live and you and your brother can afford to go to college.

---

Molly, I’m going to have to work on these dresses tomorrow. I may need your help.

---

## MOLLY:
Of course.

---

## JAKE:
And you also, David.

---

## DAVID:
Me, also. I’m an also.

---

## JAKE:
Oh, I’m so upset. don’t know what I’m going to do.

---

## MOLLY:
You’ll come to the table and have dinner. That’s what you’re going to do.  Come on, everyone. Let’s go to the table.

---

## MOLLY:
David, will you help me?

---

## DAVID:
I’ll help you.

---

## ROSALIE:
Sammy, will you help me with my essay after dinner? 

---

## ROSALIE:
Oh, Pa. The American Legion is having a contest for the best essay about one of our Founding Fathers. 

---

I’m going to enter.

---

## JAKE:
That’s wonderful.

---

## ROSALIE:
I could win fifty dollars.

---

## JAKE:
Fifty dollars? That could help pay for your college.

---

## ROSALIE:
I’m going to use Sammy’s encyclopedia.

---

## JAKE:
Sammy, you’ll help your sister write the essay.

---

## SAMMY:
I’m going out with friends. It’s holiday.

---

## JAKE:
Tomorrow’s a holiday. Tonight you can stay in and help your sister.

---

## SAMMY:
Aw, gee.

---

## JAKE:
Don’t say “gee.” “Gee” is a boy’s word. Someday, you’re going to be a college graduate. 

---

College graduates don’t say “gee.”

---

## SAMMY:
Okay, Pa.

---

## MOLLY:
Rosalie, did you decide who you’re going to write about in your essay? 

---

## ROSALIE:
I’m going to write about George Washington. Because you’ve always had his picture on the wall.

---

## MOLLY:
He’s always been my favorite.

---

## DAVID:
You know who was the greatest Founding Father?

---

## ROSALIE:
Who, Uncle David?

---

## DAVID:
Your Papa Max. Mine and Molly’s father.

---

## ROSALIE:
Papa Max wasn’t a Founding Father.

---

## DAVID:
Sure, he was founding. He came on a boat, he saw the Statue of Liberty, and he said, “Oh, look, America!” He found it.

---

## MOLLY:
He’s got a point.

---

## ROSALIE:
Okay, Uncle David. Papa Max found America.

---

## DAVID:
Lucky for us.

---

The telephone rings.

---

## MOLLY:
I’ll get it.

---

## MOLLY:
Hello?... Yes, this is the Goldberg residence. To whom am I talking to?... 

---

Mr. Silverman?... Oh, yes. Mr. Silverman. Yes .... Hold on.

---


Jake. It’s Mr. Silverman. He wants to talk to you.

---

## JAKE:
I don’t want to talk to him.

---

## MOLLY:
Maybe he has something to say that will help.

---

## JAKE:
Nothing he has to say is going to change my position.

---

## MOLLY:
Mr. Silverman. I’m sorry. He doesn’t want to talk to you....

---

Yes, I know. Yes .... Hold on.  Jake, he says you have always had a good relationship.

---

## JAKE:
Not any more. Our relationship is null and void.

---

## MOLLY:
Mr. Silverman. I’m sorry. He says your relationship is null and also it’s void .... 

---

I’m sorry. Maybe another time.....Yes, thank you. 

---

You have a nice holiday, too. 

---

Although I don’t know how you have a nice holiday when you don’t have a job....All right. Goodbye.

---

## MOLLY:
Jake, Darling, how is your dinner?

---

## JAKE:
I don’t even know what I’m eating. I’m so upset. I think we should all get to work.

---

## MOLLY:
Oh, this is going to be some holiday.

---

## ELI:
Who’s getting fired?

---

## GERTRUDE:
Not now.

---

## ELI:
Who’s getting fired?

---

## GERTRUDE:
Not now.

---

## ELI:
Just tell me. Give me a name.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Oh, you want me to name names?

---

## ELI:
No, I don’t want you to -

---

How many names are we talking about?

---

## GERTRUDE:
Walt?

---

## WALTER:
Hold, please.

---

## GERTRUDE:
I want to take a pause.

---

## WALTER:
Yes, Mrs. Berg.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Okay. You’re right. should do this.

---

## ELI:
Do what?

---

## GERTRUDE:
Phil? Larry? Arlene? Come out here, Darlings.

---

## ARLENE:
I’m changing.

---

## ARLENE:
I’m never going to make this change.

---

## GERTRUDE:
I told you to wear one dress on top of another.

---

## ARLENE:
And I told you when I wear one dress on top of another, my agent says it makes me look fat!

---

## GERTRUDE:
Don’t change. Just come out here.

---

## ELI:
What’s going on?

---

## GERTRUDE:
Everybody sit.

---

## GERTRUDE:
All right. I was trying to put this off, but I can't put it off. 

---

I have been informed by our network that the sponsors of our show 

---

are concerned about the attitudes of their customers toward their products.

---

## GERTRUDE:
To ward off any unfavorable disposition toward their products, 

---

they wish to have any controversial personalities in any television shows that they sponsor...

---

removed.

---

## ELI:
Oh, for... So it’s Phil.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Yes.

---

## PHILIP:
Me. I’m a controversial personality.

---

## ELI:
I thought this was handled.

---

## GERTRUDE:
I’ve been handling it. For nine months. But this “Red Channels...”

---

## ELI:
Well, you’re not going to fire Phil.

---

## WALTER:
If she doesn’t, they’ll cancel the show.

---

## ELI:
They’re not going to cancel the show. This is Gertrude Berg. The second most popular woman in America.

---

## ELI:
Eleanor Roosevelt.

---

## ELI:

Gertrude Berg.

---

## WALTER:
There are other considerations.

---

## ELI:
Nobody tells Gertrude Berg what to do.

---

## GERTRUDE:
There’s a man.

---

## ELI:
What man?

---

## ARLENE:
What man?

---

## GERTRUDE:
A man named Lawrence Johnson. Up in Syracuse, New York. He owns grocery stores.

---

## ELI:
Grocery stores.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Mr. Johnson is a big fan of the House Un-American Activities Committee. 

---

He's been handing out copies of Red Channels in his grocery stores. He's put up signs.

---

## GERTRUDE:
They say, "Do you want any part of the purchase price of any products advertised on CBS to be used to pay for Communist sympathizers?"

---

## ELI:
Oh, for -

---

## PHILIP:
From one grocer can be out of work? You’re going to let them do that?

---

## GERTRUDE:
It’s not just one grocer. It’s many letters from many housewives.

---

## ELI:
What about Frank Stanton? assume the President of CBS has some feelings about this.

---

## GERTRUDE:
He’s as afraid of General Foods as General Foods is afraid of Lawrence Johnson.

---

## ELI:
Then go to Bill Paley. He loves you.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Doesn’t matter.

---

## ELI:
You were his biggest hit on radio for twenty years and now you’re his most popular show on television. 

---

That doesn’t matter?

---

## WALTER:
Not with this.

---

## GERTRUDE:
He’s afraid.

---

## ELI:
The founder and chairman of CBS is afraid?

---

## PHILIP:
Now, he’s the chairman of CBS. At heart, he’s still a Jew from Ukraine with a cigar company.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Everyone is afraid.

---

## ELI:
Everyone?

---

## WALTER:
It's all over the network. I know from our casting director. 

---

If we need other actors for the show, she gets lists of submissions from agents.

---

## WALTER:
Whoever gets a no doesn't even get an audition. The sponsors don't want to get more letters. 

---

I don't blame them.

---

## PHILIP:
I didn’t ask to be in Red Channels.

---

## WALTER:
And didn’t ask to direct a show that has an actor who’s listed in Red Channels.

---

## PHILIP:
That’s not who I am. 38. 10.

---

## WALTER:
That’s who they think you are.

---

## PHILIP:
I was also voted Best Dad of the Year by the Boy Scouts of America. Why doesn’t anybody talk about that?

---

## LARRY:
Excuse me.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Yes, Larry.

---

## LARRY:
May I ask a question?

---

## GERTRUDE:
Of course.

---

## LARRY:
What is Red Channels?

---

## ELI:
You don’t know what Red Channels is?

---

## LARRY:
I don’t really follow politics.

---

## ELI:
You want to explain it to him?

---

## PHILIP:
I don’t want to explain it to him.

---

## ELI:
Can I explain it to him? 

---

## GERTRUDE:
Yes.

---

## ELI:
You’ve heard of Communism?

---

## LARRY:
Yes.

---

## ELI:
You’ve heard of the Blacklist.

---

## LARRY:
Sure. That’s where actors who are communists -

---

## PHILIP & ELI:
Accused.

---

## PHILIP:
Of being communists.

---

## LARRY:
Accused of being communists aren’t allowed to be in movies.

---

## ELI:
Right. Well, there are these three guys, see, ex-FBI agents, 

---

and they were sitting around with nothing to do and they decided so many people in Hollywood were blacklisted, 

---

gee, now there's this new thing called television.

---

## ELI:
Why don't we put together a list and see if we can't get some television people blacklisted. 

---

So a few months ago they published this little booklet that has the names of 151 people in it and they called it Red Channels.

---

## WALTER:
You may think this is a joke.

---

## ELI:
I don’t think it’s a joke. I know some of those people.

---

## ELI:
You can’t. 

---

## WALTER:
Mrs. Berg. No one will blame you. He’s listed in Red Channels. You did what you have to do.

---

## ELI:
But she doesn’t have to do it.

---

## WALTER:
You don’t have to say anything about Red Channels. Say it’s personal reasons. 

---

Or artistic differences. And you recast. Sometimes actors get replaced. It’s just business.

---

## ELI:
And who are you going to get to replace him?

---

## WALTER:
To be on The Goldbergs? There are plenty of actors who would jump at the chance.

---

## ELI:
Well, it would have to be somebody good.

---

## WALTER:
Sure.

---

## ELI:
Fatherly type. Can handle comedy.

---

## WALTER:
Right.

---

## ELI:
And not “controversial.”

---

## WALTER:
Goes without saying.

---

## ELI:
I know. How about Jack Gilford?

---

## PHILIP:
No. He’s also in Red Channels. 

---

## ELI:
Oh, that’s right. Let me think. How about Luther Adler?

---

## PHILIP:
He’s also in Red Channels.

---

## ELI:
Zero Mostel?

---

## PHILIP:
Also.

---

## ELI:
Lee J. Cobb?

---

## PHILIP:
Also.

---

## ELI:
Sam Jaffe?

---

## PHILIP:
Also.

---

## ELI:
Sam Wanamaker.

---

## PHILIP:
Also.

---

## ELI:
Morris Carnovsky.

---

## PHILIP:
Also.

---

## ELI:
Edward G. Robinson.

---

## PHILIP:
Also.

---

## ELI:
You got a real problem on your hands.

---

## LARRY:
Is there anyone on the list who isn’t Jewish?

---

## ELI:
Ummmm...

---

## PHILIP:
Lena Horne.

---

## LARRY:
Oh, I love Lena Horne.

---

## ELI:
Too bad you’re not friends with Ed Sullivan.

---

## PHILIP:

Why Ed Sullivan?

---

## ELI:
I heard he wanted Lena Horne on "Toast of the Town." He went over the sponsor's head. 

---

He went over J. Edgar Hoover's head. He got to Cardinal Spellman.

---

## ELI:
And Cardinal Spellman... Did whatever the goyim do... And Lena Horne gets to be on "Toast of the Town."

---



Do you know Ed Sullivan?

---

## GERTRUDE:
No.

---

## ELI:
Who do you know?

---

## GERTRUDE:
I know Milton Berle.

---

## ELI:
Too Jewish. Anyone else?

---

## GERTRUDE:
Not like Ed Sullivan.

---

## ELI:
Well, come on, people. There must be something we can do to help Phil.

---

## ARLENE:
He could confess.

---

## ELI:
I’m sorry, what?

---

## ARLENE:
Confess that he’s a communist and go before the committee and promise not to ever be involved in subversive activities.

---

## ELI:
Who are you? Dick Nixon?

---

## PHILIP:
Subversive activities? Look at the subversive activities they have listed under my name. 

---

I was on the End Jim Crow in Baseball Committee.

---

## ELI:
How dare you, Sir!

---

## PHILIP:
I like baseball and think Negroes should be allowed to play baseball.

---

## ELI:
Outrageous!

---

## PHILIP:
I'm not a fan of Franco so I joined a committee to aid Spanish democracy. 

---

I signed a petition against Martin Dies when the Dies Committee was going after the Federal Theatre Project.

---

## ARLENE:
Well, those all sound like pretty subversive activities to me.

---

## PHILIP:
You can think what you’d like.

---

## ARLENE:
And my daddy always says, “Where there’s smoke, there’s fire.”

---

## ELI:

Then I would say to your daddy  “Er hot nisht ale mebl in der dakh”

---

## GERTRUDE:

What does that mean?

---

## ELI:
You don’t know?

---

## GERTRUDE:
No.

---

## ELI:
You don’t speak Yiddish?

---

## GERTRUDE:
No, I don’t.

---

## ELI:
You’re the most famous Jew in the country and you don’t speak Yiddish?

---

## GERTRUDE:
I didn’t go to school that day.

---

## ELI:
“Er hot nisht ale mebl in der dakh” means  “There’s no furniture in his attic.”

---

## ARLENE:
Well, I never! 

---

## GERTRUDE:
Eli!

---

## PHILIP:
Eli!

---

## ELI:
That’s just the kind of attitude... People talk about Communism, they have no idea what Communism is.

---

## ARLENE:
I know they’re trying to infiltrate our country to destroy our Democratic way of life.

---

## ELI:
My point exactly.

---

## ARLENE:
I don’t have to be a Marxist to know what Communism is about.

---

## ELI:
At least you know what Marxism is.

---

## ARLENE:
I’m not an ignorant person.

Like some people I know.

---

## GERTRUDE:

Stop it! I can’t believe this.

---

## PHILIP:
No, no. It’s all right.

---

I do admit to being a Marxist.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Phil.

---

## WALTER:
What?

---

## ARLENE:
Ah-hah! You see? If you confess -

---

## PHILIP:
I was in the movie of “Room Service” with Groucho, Harpo, and Chico Marx. I love them.

---

## LARRY:
Really? Wow.

---

## ARLENE:
Well, I don’t think that’s funny.

---

## WALTER:
Look... I have an idea. May I suggest an idea?

---

## GERTRUDE:
Sure, Walter. What?

---

## WALTER:
How about...

You two go to Syracuse.

---

## PHILIP:
Syracuse?

---

## WALTER:
To the grocery store. Take the fight to them. 

---

How excited would the people in Syracuse be to meet the Goldbergs?

---

## PHILIP:
No.

---

## WALTER:
You bring your Emmy.

You bring your Boy Scout thing.

---

## PHILIP:
No.

---

## WALTER:
In ten minutes, you’ll wash away any negative publicity that’s out there.
---

## PHILIP:
No!

---

## ELI:
Walt. You can’t give these people your attention.

---

## PHILIP:
You talk to them, it legitimizes them.

---

## ELI:
You end up giving them the spotlight.

---

## WALTER:
Mrs. Berg?

---

## GERTRUDE:
It’s not a viable option.

---

## WALTER:
Just a thought. Here’s another one you’re not going to like... 

---

Sign the loyalty pledge. 

---

## PHILIP: 
No!

---

## ELI:
Oh, for—

---

## ARLENE: 
Why is that such a bad idea?

---

## ELI:
You sign a loyalty pledge and they use that as evidence of your guilty conscience. 

---

## ARLENE: 
I’d sign it.

---

## ELI:
Of course you would.

---

## ARLENE:
I don’t have a guilty conscience.

---

## PHILIP:
I have done nothing wrong!

---

## WALTER:
We’re just trying to help.

---

## ELI:
Who?

---

Him? That’s not the kind of help he needs.

---

## PHILIP:
All right, Eli. Enough. You’re talking about me in the third person and I’m standing right here.

---

Enough already.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Please, darlings. Please. Let’s get back to work.

---

## ELI:
Back to work?

---

## ARLENE:
What are you going to do?

---

## GERTRUDE:
When know, you’ll know. What I know for sure is we have a show to do tonight. Come on.

---

## WALTER:
Where do you want to take it from?

---

## GERTRUDE:
Let’s go back to the table so Arlene can practice her change.

---

## WALTER:
Right. Places, please.

---

## LARRY:
Mrs. Berg?

---

## GERTRUDE:
What is it, Larry, darling?

---

## LARRY:
Well, I don’t want to say anything to hurt anybody’s feelings, but...

---

## GERTRUDE:
Yes?

---

## LARRY:
You are going to fire him, right?

---

## GERTRUDE:
You want me to fire Phil?

---

## LARRY:
I don’t want to lose my job.

---

## GERTRUDE:
If you lose this job, you’ll get another job.

---

## LARRY:
No. I don’t think so.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Why not?

---

## LARRY:
I’m not a good actor.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Yes, you are.

---

## LARRY:
No. I’m not. If I were, you’d give me more to do. Every show, I come in. I go out. 

---

Bring in the blueberries, go get the strawberries. Bring in the strawberries...

---

## GERTRUDE:
All right. I’ll give you more to do.

---

## LARRY:
No, it’s fine. You and Phil, you’re great actors.

---

## GERTRUDE:
You could take lessons.

---

## LARRY:
I did. I’m not good. I know you hired me because of my looks. 

---

My mom started taking me out for modeling jobs from the time I was four years old.

---

## GERTRUDE:
I’ll give you more to do. Now, please.


---


Let’s go, Walt.

---

## WALTER:
Places, please.

---

## GERTRUDE:
On your toes, Darlings.

---

## WALTER:
And... Action.

---

## MOLLY:
Jake, Darling, how is your dinner?

---

## JAKE:
I don’t even know what I’m eating. I’m so upset. I think we should all get to work. 

---

## MOLLY: 
Oh, this is going to be some holiday.

---
---

## DAVID:
It’s good you told Jake to go to the parade with Rosie and Sammy. 

---

## MOLLY:
You think so? I think so.

---

## DAVID:
I think so, too.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Why didn’t you go to the parade?

---

## DAVID:
Parade’s make me nervous. I’m always afraid I’ll get lost. 

---

## GERTRUDE:
Get lost in a parade? But everyone is going the same way. 

---

## DAVID:
I know. I just have no sense of direction.

---

## MOLLY:
Hello Sammy, Darling.

Sammy, Darling. Where is your sister?

---

## ARLENE:
Almost ready!

---

## GERTRUDE: 
All right.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Walt.

---

## WALTER:
Hold, please.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Let’s, um...

---

## ARLENE:
I’m ready!

---

## GERTRUDE:
All right! Give me a second!

---

## GERTRUDE:
Let’s, um...

---



Let’s add some lines before “It’s good you told Jake to go to the parade.”

---

## ELI:
All right.

---

## GERTRUDE:
I’ll say, um...“Everybody gets a day off for the holiday.” 

---

Then give me something about Solly’s a doctor. He doesn’t get a day off.

---

## ELI:
Oh, nice. I haven’t mentioned Solly in awhile.

---

## GERTRUDE:
You’ll have ten more seconds!

---

## ARLENE:
Thank you!

---

## GERTRUDE:
Do you need to rehearse the change again?

---

## ARLENE:
No. I’ll make it. Thank you.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Walt, let’s take it from the top of the scene.

---

## WALTER:
Yes, Mrs. Berg. Places, please.

---

## GERTRUDE:
On your toes, Darlings.

---

## WALTER:
And... Action.

---

## MOLLY:
Oh, I love a holiday when everyone can take off from work and families can be together.

---

## DAVID:
Everyone except maybe my son, Solly, the doctor.

---

## MOLLY:
Well, yes. You’re right. A doctor might have to work if someone gets sick.

---

## DAVID:
Germs don’t take holidays.

---

## DAVID:
It’s a good thing you told Jake to go to the parade with Rosie and Sammy.
---

## MOLLY:
You think so? I think so.

---

## DAVID:
I think so, too.

---

## MOLLY:
Why didn’t you go to the parade?

---

## DAVID:
Parade’s make me nervous. I’m always afraid I’ll get lost.

---

## MOLLY:
Get lost in a parade? But everyone is going the same way.

---

## DAVID:
I know. I just have no sense of direction.

---

## ROSALIE:
We’re home! Hi, Ma.

---

## SAMMY:
Hi, Ma.

---

## MOLLY:
Hello! Hello!

---

## ROSALIE:
Hi, Uncle David.

---

## DAVID:
Hello.

---

## SAMMY:
Hi, Uncle David.

---

## DAVID:
Hello, also.

---

## GERTRUDE:
It looks like you had a good time.

---

## SAMMY:
That was a great parade, Ma.

---

## MOLLY:
Where’s your father?

---

## ROSALIE:
Oh, he’s coming. He fell behind. I think he’s still in a pretty bad mood.

---

## MOLLY:
Well, when he comes home, I want you to read your essay to him. Maybe that will cheer him up.

---

## ROSALIE:
Sure. All right. I’ll go get it.

---

## MOLLY:
Sammy, please. Go downstairs. See if you can find your father.

---

## SAMMY:
Okay, Ma.

---

## JAKE:
Well... That was fun.

---

## MOLLY:
Jake? You enjoyed the parade?

---

## JAKE:
I had a delightful time.

---

## MOLLY:
Oh, good. Good.

---

## MOLLY:
See how it’s good to take a break from work? 

---

## JAKE:
Mendel’s not the only one who knows how to have a good time. 

---

## MOLLY:
That’s right.

---

## JAKE:
Now let’s go have dinner.

---

## MOLLY:
All right.

---

## JAKE:
I still have work to do.

---

## MOLLY:
David, will you get the blintzes?

---

## DAVID:
I’ll get the blintzes.

---

## ROSALIE:
I’ll help you.

---

## MOLLY:
Jake, you’ll eat something. You’ll feel better. Then I’ll help you with the dresses.

---

## MOLLY:
Everyone enjoy your red, white, and blue blintzes.

---

## MOLLY:
Rosalie, darling. While we’re eating, you can read to us your essay about George Washington.

---

## ROSALIE:
Oh, Ma. I’m embarrassed.

---

## JAKE:
Don’t be embarrassed. I want to hear what you wrote.

---

## ROSALIE:
Okay.

---

## ROSALIE:
My favorite Founding Father is George Washington. He is my favorite founding father because he was the first president of the United States and he set the standard for how to be a great president that continues to this day.

---

## ROSALIE:
Like all Americans, George Washington was a child of immigrants. 

---

His great-grandfather, John Washington, came to America from England in 1657. 

---

George Washington was born on February 22, 1732.

---

## ROSALIE:
His parents couldn't afford a formal education for George, but he studied hard and taught himself math, logistics, and map reading. 

---

George married Martha Dandridge in 1759 and, together, they made their home at Mt. Vernon.

---

## ROSALIE:
They made it one of the finest estates in the colonies where they grew wheat, rye, barley, oats, and corn.

---

## ELI:
Oh! Corn!

---

## MOLLY:
Shhh!

---

## ROSALIE:
After "the shot heard 'round the world," the Continental Congress appointed George to be the commander of the Continental Army. 

---

His troops were often outmanned and outgunned, but George's abilities to lead and command his troops led to the victory of the American colonies.

---

## ROSALIE:
After the Revolutionary War, George was unanimously elected by the delegates of the Constitutional Convention to be the first president of the United States.

---

## ROSALIE:
During his two terms in office, George set several important precedents for the presidency. 

---

He created the first presidential cabinet to prove that he would lead with others and not act like a king.

---

## ROSALIE:
And after voluntarily stepping down, George established the tradition of a peaceful transfer of power.

---

## ROSALIE:
George Washington was a great writer and is remembered for many of his speeches - 

---

## ARLENE:
Walt?

---

## ARLENE:
Can I read what I wrote? You don’t even know what I’ve got. 

---

## ARLENE:
Walt?

---

## ARLENE: 
I would just like the opportunity 

---

## ARLENE:
Walt?

---

## ARLENE:
Please.

---

## GERTRUDE: 
Walt.

---

## WALTER:
Hold, please.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Arlene has written her own -

---

## ELI:
Arlene has written?

---

## GERTRUDE:
Her own version of the essay. I’m sorry I didn’t have time to read it.  Please.

---

## ROSALIE:
My favorite Founding Father is George Washington. 

---

He is my favorite founding father because, like our own President Truman, 

---

he believed that the United States is the greatest country in the history of the world 

---

and that Democracy is the greatest system of government.

---

## PHILIP:
What?

---

## ROSALIE:
George Washington was born on February 22, 1732. His parents couldn't afford a formal education for George, 

---

but George studied hard and taught himself math, logistics, and map reading.

---

## ROSALIE:
These skills would serve him well when it came time for him to lead a small, 

---

inexperienced army against a mean world power.

---

## ELI:
Oh! Corn!

---

## ROSALIE:
After "the shot heard 'round the world," the Continental Congress appointed George to be the commander of the Continental Army. 

---

His skills as a commander and his vision of making America the greatest nation on Earth led to his many victories in battle.

---

## ROSALIE:
After the Revolutionary War, George was unanimously elected to be the first president of the United States. 

---

Even though he was no longer on the battlefield, he continued to serve his country against all enemies, foreign and domestic.

---

## ROSALIE:
Just like President Truman, today, is fighting the Communists at home and abroad.

---

## PHILIP:
Arlene...
---

## ELI:
Gert?

---

## ROSALIE:
George was a great writer and is remembered for many of his speeches and letters. 

---

My favorite quote is from his address to Congress in 1793.

---

“If we desire to avoid insult, we must be able to repel it. 

---

If we desire to secure peace, it must be known that we are at all times ready for war.”

---

## ELI:
Oh, come on!

---

## GERTRUDE:
Calm down.

---

## PHILIP:
What are you trying to do?

---

## ARLENE:
I’m trying .... To make a point.

---

## PHILIP:
About war? You think war is a good thing?

---

## ARLENE:
I think we should support our president.

---

## ELI:
You think it’s great that Truman is starting a war in Korea?

---

## ARLENE:
I think it’s great that Truman is fighting the communists.

---

## PHILIP:
And if young men die?

---

## ARLENE:
If that’s what it takes.

---

## ELI:
If that’s what it takes. How would you feel if Larry got drafted?

---

## ARLENE:

If that’s what happens - 

---

## LARRY:
Oh. No. I have a heart thing. I’m 4-F, so... No.

---

## ELI:
You’re not going to let her...

---

## GERTRUDE:
Arlene. I gave you the opportunity to read what you wrote. Are you happy?

---

## ARLENE:
I’ll be happy if you let me read it on air.

---

## GERTRUDE:
You’ll read what I wrote.

---

## ARLENE:
Maybe if I read what I wrote, people will say the Goldbergs are supporting America instead of trying to tear it down.

---

## PHILIP & ELI:
No one is -

---

## PHILIP:
Trying to tear it down!

---

## GERTRUDE:
You will read what I wrote.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Walt?

---

## WALTER:
Let’s take it from the top of the essay.

---

## ROSALIE:
My favorite founding father -

---

## GERTRUDE:
Cut to the end.

---

## WALTER:
Cut to the end.

---

## ROSALIE:
George was a great writer and is remembered for many of his speeches and letters. My favorite quote -

---

## ROSALIE:
My favorite quote is from his famous letter to the Hebrew Congregation in Newport, Rhode Island.

---

“May the children of the stock of Abraham, who dwell in this land, 

---

continue to merit and enjoy the free will of the other inhabitants, and there shall be none to make him afraid.” The end.

---

## MOLLY:
That’s beautiful, Rosalie, darling.

---

## JAKE:
Beautiful. I’m very proud of you, Rosalie. 

---

## ROSALIE: 
Thanks, Ma. Thanks, Pa.

---

## DAVID:
I didn’t know George Washington was such a nice fella.

---

The telephone rings.

---

## MOLLY:
I’ll get it. Who could be calling? I can’t imagine.

---

## MOLLY:
Hello?....Yes. Who is this? .... 

---

Oh, Mr. Mendel! Why, what a coincidental coincidence. Jake was just talking about you. 

---

How are you, Mr. Mendel?

---

 .... Oh! You’re at Pincus Pines. I hope you and Mrs. Mendel are having a lovely time there ... 

---

What’s that? You want to talk to Jake? Well, of course. Hold onto the phone for just a moment.

---

Jake, darling. It’s Mr. Mendel calling all the way from Pincus Pines. Quick. Quick. It’s very long distance.

---

## JAKE:
Hello, Mendel? 

---

... Yes, what is it? Is everything okay?

---

## WALTER:
Hold, please.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Can’t we finish? We’re almost at the end.

---

## WALTER:
Union rules. We have to break.

---

## WALTER:
Please remember to fill out your orders for dinner.

---

## ELI:
Could you bring mine, please?

---

## GERTRUDE:
What time is it?

---

## WALTER:
Four thirty.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Nothing from the switchboard?

---

## WALTER:
No.

---

## ARLENE:
Did you say four thirty?

---

## WALTER:
Yes.

---

## ARLENE:
I have a phone call to make. Can I use the backstage phone?

---

## WALTER & GERTRUDE:
No!

---

## ARLENE:
Fine.

---

## ELI:
I’ll just have my usual. Pastrami on rye, cole slaw, chocolate rugelach, and a cream soda.

---

## WALTER:
How can you eat like that?

---

## ELI:
I’m a growing boy.

---

## PHILIP:
Walt. Can’t we... Can we take a vote and if everyone agrees, we can skip the break?

---

## ELI:
Skip the break?

---

## WALTER:
I’d have to check with the union steward. But that’s you.

---

## PHILIP:
I don’t want to just sit around.

---

## WALTER:
Mrs. Berg?

---

## GERTRUDE:
I need a break.

---

## WALTER:
We’re on a break.

---

## ELI:
Skip the break? That’s funny, coming from you.

---

## ELI:
You young people don’t know this. We get breaks like this because of him.

---

## LARRY:
Really?

---

## ELI:
He was one of the founders of Actors Equity. 

---

It’s because of him that actors get rehearsal pay and breaks and limits on how many hours they can be in rehearsal.

---



Tell them the ventilation story.

---

## PHILIP:
I don’t want to tell the ventilation story.

---

## ELI:
Can I tell them the ventilation story?

---

## GERTRUDE:
Tell them the ventilation story.

---

## ELI:
Phil was directing a show on Broadway. The cast is sitting in chairs while Phil is giving notes, pacing back and forth. 

---

Somebody, probably everybody, notices that Phil's fly is open.

---

## ELI:
Finally, somebody says, "Hey, Phil, your fly is open." 

---

And without missing a beat, Phil says, "I'm protesting the management's lack of air cooling! It's for ventilation!"

---

## ELI:
When radio started, he and George Heller set up the American Federation of Radio Artists. 

---

Now, you’re on television. Thanks to him, there’s the Television Authority. 

---

You happy with how much you’re getting paid?

---

## ARLENE:
Yes.

---

## LARRY:
Oh, gosh. Yes.

---

## ELI:
That’s thanks to him. You know how the network makes kinescopes of all the shows we do? 

---

If they ever air one of those kinescopes, you’ll get paid for that. Thanks to him.

---

## ARLENE:
The network might broadcast a show we’ve already done?

---

## ELI:
They might.

---

## ARLENE:
Why would anybody want to see the same show twice?

---

## ELI:
Haven’t you ever gone to a movie you liked for a second time?

---

## ARLENE:
No. Why would I want to see something when I know how it’s going to end?

---

## LARRY:
I saw “On the Town” twice.

---

## ELI:
There you go.

---

## LARRY:
I love that movie.

---

## PHILIP:
We still need to combine the Radio Artists with the Television Authority.

---

## ELI:
You keep working on that.
He will not rest until he has everyone mad at him.

---

## PHILIP:
That’s my plan.

---

## ELI:
That's why the committee's after you. They want to bust the unions. 

---

So they say the Communists are running the unions.

---

## ELI:
He will not rest until he has everyone mad at him. Oymigod!

---

## GERTRUDE:
Yes, Lar You don’t have to raise your hand.

---

## LARRY:
May I ask a question?

---

## GERTRUDE:
Yes. What?

---

## LARRY:
When did Communism become a bad thing? Are the Communists running the unions? 

---

## GERTRUDE: 
No, Larry.

---

## PHILIP:
You don’t have to worry.

---

## ELI:
Very good question. You know, there was a time when Communism was quite popular in this country.

---

## GERTRUDE:
During the Depression.

---

## ELI:
During the Depression, Capitalism was the problem in this country. 

---

The Fascists were taking over Europe. Communism was what all the hep cats were into. Particularly, the artists.

---

## ELI:
I would have given anything to be in the Group Theater. Waiting for Lefty. Men in White.

---

## PHILIP:
The Marxists wrote all the best plays.

---

## ELI:
“Strike! Strike!”

---

## PHILIP:
The most important man in the world lived in Russia.

---

## WALTER:
Stalin?

---

## PHILIP:
No. Stanislavsky.
---

## WALTER:
Was he a Communist?

---

## PHILIP:
I don’t believe so. But he was definitely a Russian.

---

## WALTER:
Well, I got nothing against Russians in general.

---

## ELI:
They used to be our allies.

---

## WALTER:
I fought shoulder to shoulder with Russians when we took Berlin.

---

## ELI:
Wait. You were in the Battle of Berlin?

---

## WALTER:
Yeah. Were you?

---

## ELI:
Me? No. I was in the South Pacific entertaining the troops with the U.S.O.

---

## WALTER:
Hey, we were all fighting the fascists. I did it one way. 

---

You did it yours. Everybody counts.

---

## ELI:
You were in Berlin.

---

## WALTER:
Yep.

---

## ELI:
But after the war.

---

## PHILIP:
The Truman Doctrine. 

---

## ELI:
You got yourself a Cold War and the Red Scare begins.

---

## PHILIP:
Anything. Any past activity of yours that they can use against you... They will.

---

## ELI:
Which is why Phil’s name shows up in Red Channels. Because he went to a rally. Because he signed a petition.

---

## LARRY:
That’s all it takes?

---

## ELI:
There’s a listing in Red Channels for Uta Hagen because she signed a greeting card to the Moscow Art Theatre.

---



But you. You’re the trifecta. You’re a rabble-rouser. 

---

You’re an actor on a hit TV show. And you’re a Jew.

---

## PHILIP:
Lucky me.

---

## ELI:
Just because he cares about how people in this country are being treated, 

---

they Joe McCarthy think he’s out there yelling, “Workers of the World Unite!”

---

## ARLENE:
Please! Don’t even say that.

---

## ELI:
Oh, Miss McQuade. It has come to our attention that you have been seen in the company of suspected Communist sympathizers.

---

## ARLENE:
No, I haven’t.

---

## PHILIP:
Eli.

---

## ELI:
Do you know any members of the Communist Party? Will you give us their names?

---

## ARLENE:
I don’t -

---

## ELI:
You work in television. You must know some fellow travelers. 

---

Will you give us their names?

---

## ARLENE:
I don’t know -

---

## ELI:
Are you now or have you ever been a member of the Communist Party?

---

## ARLENE:
No!

---

## GERTRUDE:
Eli, stop!

---

## ELI:
I just want her to understand.

---

## ARLENE:
I understand that if people think that one of us is a Communist, they might think all of us are Communists. 

---

I can’t have that.

---

## ELI:
Why would anyone call you a Commie? You haven’t done anything wrong.

---

## ARLENE:
It doesn’t matter if you’ve done anything wrong. 

---

They can call you a Communist and ruin your career for no reason at all.

---

## ELI:
No! Really? Oymygod, that’s terrible.

---

## ARLENE:
It’s not funny! I have my career to think about.

---

## ELI:
We all have careers.

---

## ARLENE:
Not just on this show. I have plans.

---

## GERTRUDE:
What plans?

---

## ARLENE:
I wasn’t going to tell you because nothing’s definite yet. 

---

My daddy and my agent and I are talking about a new plan for me.

---

## GERTRUDE:
To do what?

---

## ARLENE:
What do you think?

---

I want to do what you do. Have my own show. Write. Produce. Star in it. 

---

## GERTRUDE:
You’re giving me this now?

---

## ARLENE:
It’s not definite.

---

## GERTRUDE:
You’re contracted to the end of the season.

---

## ARLENE:
I know.

---

If we get to the end of the season.

---

## ELI:
Oh, come on! 

---

## ARLENE:
What? I’m just being honest. If people think we have Communists on the show, we’re going to get canceled.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Not if we stick together.

---

## ARLENE:
Then we’re saying that Communism is okay!

---

## PHILIP:
No one is saying Communism is okay!

---

## ARLENE:
Okay, look. I have an idea.

---

## GERTRUDE:
You have an idea?

---

## ARLENE:
I have an idea.

You could write Jake out of the show for awhile.

---

## ELI:
There’s never been an episode of The Goldbergs without Jake in it.

---

## ARLENE:
Just temporary. He could go to Pincus Pines for a rest.

---

## PHILIP:
You’re going to tell her what to write?

---

## ARLENE:
I’m just trying to be helpful. And I think it’s awful to put Mrs. Berg in this terrible position. It’s selfish. 

---

Now it’s either him or us and I think he should stop being selfish and do the right thing.

---

## PHILIP:
And what would be the right thing?

---

## ARLENE:
I don’t know.

---



If he wants to stay on the show, he has to do whatever you do to prove that you’re a patriotic American.

---

## ELI:
You don’t think he’s a patriotic American.

---

## ARLENE:
It doesn’t matter what I think. The men on the House UnAmerican Activities Committee don’t think so.

---

## ELI:
And that’s good enough for you.

---

## ARLENE:
Yes, it is. They have promised to uphold the Constitution and protect our country from all hostile enemies to our freedom.

---

## ELI:
They are patriotic Americans.

---

## ARLENE:
Yes, they are.

---

## ELI:
And you admire them.

---

## ARLENE:
Yes, I do.

---

## ELI:
Because they’re good, patriotic Americans. And they’ll fight the commies wherever they find them.

---

## ARLENE:
Yes.

---

## ELI:
Great.

---

## ELI:

Tell her about Peekskill.

---

## PHILIP:
Peekskill? Why would I want to -

---

## ELI:
Come on. I think it would be very illuminating for Arlene, here, 

---

to learn about the patriotic Americans of Peekskill. Tell her about Peekskill.

---

## PHILIP:
Peekskill. It’s up in Westchester County. A lot of activists go up there in the summers. 

---

The communists. The socialists.

---

## ELI:
It’s like the Borscht Belt for lefties.

---



Go on.

---

## PHILIP:
You're talking about 1949. It was just last summer, August. We were raising funds for the Civil Rights Congress. 

---

There was a concert. The headliner was Paul Robeson.

---

## ARLENE:
He’s a Communist.

---

## ELI:
Shut. Up.

---

## PHILIP:
Day of the concert, they were setting up a stage. Some of the local boys showed up. 

---

Made it clear they didn’t want that crowd in their park.

---

## ELI:
Because they’re good patriotic Americans.

---

## PHILIP:
They broke up the stage and the chairs that had been set up. 

---

A few of them built a fire to toss in books and brochures about civil rights.

---

## PHILIP:
A few of them set up a cross and burned Robeson in effigy. Yelling, "Hang Paul Robeson."

---

## LARRY:
Didn’t anybody call the police?

---

## PHILIP:
Sure. They were there. Watched the whole thing. No arrests were made. 

---

They blamed the organizers of the event for all the trouble.

---

## PHILIP:
They told everybody to go home. The mob went home. We went home. The concert was canceled.

---

## LARRY:
Well, they had to. Right.

---

## PHILIP:
Sure. But they rescheduled the concert for the following week.

---

## ELI:
You don’t tell Paul Robeson what to do.

---

## PHILIP:
He went on the radio and he said, “This is America. I have a right to sing. I’m going to sing.”

---

## ELI:
Damn right.

---

## PHILIP:
So word spread. The next week, thousands of people showed up.

---

## ELI:
Ten, fifteen thousand.

---

## PHILIP:
Came up from New York. Caravans of cars. Some people chartered buses. 

---

Pete Seeger opened the concert.

---

## PHILIP:
He sang, "If I Had a Hammer" and We. Shall. Not. Be.

---

## PHILIP & ELI:
We shall not be moved

---

## PHILIP:
And then Robeson came on.

---

## ELI:
Now it gets interesting.

---

## PHILIP:
There were rumors that they were snipers in the trees so a group of people held hands 

---

and formed a circle around Robeson to protect him.

---

## PHILIP:
But you could see him anyway because Robeson is always the tallest person wherever he is.

---

## ELI:
He’s huge.

---

## PHILIP:
He sang some spirituals and he sang “Old Man River” with the lyrics the way he had rewritten them.

---

I won’t stop fightin’... Until I’m dyin.

---

Then, in Yiddish, he sang “Song of the Warsaw Ghetto.”

---

## LARRY:
What does it mean?

---

## ELI:
It’s the song of the Warsaw Ghetto. Everyone is really defiant and then they all get killed.

---

## PHILIP:
Anyway.

---

## ELI:
Anyway.

---

## PHILIP:
It was a beautiful afternoon of music. Then, when everyone goes to leave, we see the police had blocked off all the exits but one. 

---

All the cars and buses had to go out one road.

---

## PHILIP:
And the local boys. They were ready for us. They got help from the local American Legion and the VFW. They threw rocks.

---

## PHILIP:
With bats and clubs, they attacked the cars and buses. 

---

Dragged people out through the windows. They yelled, "Go home, Commies!... "We're Hitler's boys -"

---

## ELI:
“We’re Hitler’s boys -”

---

## PHILIP:
“And we’ll finish the job!”

---

## ELI:
“And we’ll finish the job!”

---

## PHILIP:
“Jews will not replace us!”

---

## ELI:
“Jews will not replace us.”

---

## PHILIP:
To the Negroes it looked like it was a lynching. To the Jews it looked like a pogrom.

---

## LARRY:
Where were the police?

---

## PHILIP:
Oh, they were there. They were there to protect the rights of free speech for the people throwing the rocks.

---

## ELI:
Pete Seeger was in a car with his wife and two boys. Every window was smashed. 

---

They’re lucky they got out of there alive.

---

## LARRY:
Was anybody killed?

---

## PHILIP:
Killed? No. Some broken bones. Fractured skulls. Mostly cuts and bruises.

---

## LARRY:
Wasn’t anyone arrested?

---

## ELI:
Arrested? No.

---

## PHILIP:
The Governor Dewey held an investigation and determined that the Communists were responsible for the riots.

---

## ELI:
Robeson lost a lot of concert bookings.

---

## PHILIP:
The U.S. State Department revoked his passport.

---

## ELI:
Courtesy of the good, patriotic Americans.

---



## ELI:
And those are the patriotic Americans that are on your Un-American Activities committees.

---

## PHILIP:
They're a bunch of Nazi Bundist, anti-Semitic, anti-Labor, anti-Negro, America Firsters and I will not lie down to them!

---

## WALTER:
Mrs. Berg?

---

## WALTER:
We, umm... Break’s over. We’re actually over the, um... 

---

What do you want to do?

---

## GERTRUDE:
Just... Just...

---

Phil...

---

## PHILIP:
What?

---

## GERTRUDE:
There’s no rush. Nobody minds.

---



Right?

---

## ELI:
No. Not at all.

---

## PHILIP:
Minds what?

---

## GERTRUDE:
If you want to take some time.

---

## PHILIP:
Time for what? Let’s go! Forty years, I’m a professional actor.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Okay.

---

## PHILIP:
Let’s get to work!

---

## ELI:
Let’s get to work.

---

## WALTER:
We are back, Ladies and Gentlemen. Places, please.

---

## GERTRUDE:
From the end of the phone call.

---



On your toes, Darlings.

---

## WALTER:

And... Action.

---

## MOLLY:
Jake, darling. It’s Mr. Mendel. Calling all the way from Pincus Pines. Quick. Quick. It’s very long distance.

---

## JAKE:
Hello, Mendel?... Yes, what is it? Is everything okay?

---

## WALTER:
Hold, please.

---

## GERTRUDE:
What?!

---

## WALTER:
Mrs. Berg, you asked me to stop if the switchboard rang.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Oh! Yes, yes.

---

## WALTER:
I can have them transfer it down to you.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Yes. Yes. Thank you.

---



I’m sorry, darlings. I just need a few minutes. Eli, go have a smoke. Arlene. Larry. Go with him.

---

## LARRY:
I don’t smoke.

---

## GERTRUDE:
It’s time you did. Go.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Phil.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Hello?... Yes, this is Mrs. Gertrude Berg... Yes. I’ll hold for Cardinal Spellman.

---

## PHILIP:
Cardinal...?

---

## GERTRUDE:
Hello? Oh, my. Hello... 

---

I'm so honored and I am almost speechless that you would call me Mr., I mean, Cardinal, 

---

I mean, I'm sorry I don't know what to call you... 

---

Eminence. Well, yes, Your Eminence. Of course, because you are so eminent. Everybody knows that.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Well, thank you. Thank you for returning my call. I really didn't know… 

---

You… Really? You've watched my show? Well I'm very flattered… 

---That's very kind of you to say... 

---

And you've enjoyed it… No, that is true. You don't have to be Jewish. 

---That's absolutely true.

---

## GERTRUDE:
May I tell you? One time, I received a letter from a Mother Superior … 

---

Yes. From a convent. I'm sorry I don't remember which one. 

---

But this Mother Superior wrote in 

---

because she wanted to know if I could send her synopses of six weeks worth of programs because, you see, 

---

the nuns in her convent had given up The Goldbergs for Lent 

---

and they wanted to know what had happened… 

---

Yes. True story.

---

## GERTRUDE:
So why did I call? Well, Your Eminence, I'll tell you why I called. 

---

You and I are very different people. We come from very different backgrounds. 

---

But I think you and I are in the same business. The people business. We help people to get along.

---

## GERTRUDE:
You and the church. Me, for twenty years on the radio and already a year and a half on television. 

---

We spread the same message. That people should love each other and we should all get along. 

---

Is it all right for me to say that?

---

... All right, then.

---

## GERTRUDE:
But not all people are getting along these days. And I can only do what I do. 

---

You are so much more important than I am. You are so much more influential than I am. 

---

You can talk to people that I can't get to.

---

## GERTRUDE:
So I'm asking you, Your Eminence, to do me a great favor. 

---

I'm asking you to talk to the right people and to use your influence 

---

and to end this terrible blacklisting business against my costar, Mr. Philip Loeb and, honestly, 

---

to end it for everyone who has been damaged by it.

---

## GERTRUDE:
You're laughing. Why are you laughing?

---

... This is not Molly Goldberg talking. This is Gertrude Berg. Did you think… 

---

I was being completely serious… 

---

Molly Goldberg is a character.

---

## GERTRUDE:
If Molly Goldberg was talking to you right now, it would be very different… 

---

How different?… 

---

It's a different voice… Yes. Completely... 

---

You want to hear that voice? Sir, Your Eminence, with all due respect that … 

---

I'd really rather not...

---

## GERTRUDE:
All right, well... 

---

Let me think. If Mrs. Goldberg was talking to you, she'd say something like…

---

## GERTRUDE:
Oh, yoo-hoo! Cardinal Spellman! Would you believe it, you're my first cardinal. 

---

So let me ask you a question. Is it hard to become a cardinal? 

---

What are you before you're a cardinal? A pigeon?...

---

## GERTRUDE:
So I know you're so busy. Everybody's so busy these days. 

---

I hope, like me, you'll drink Sanka because they take all the caffeine out and they leave the sleep in… 

---

But please Mr. Cardinal Spellman. I'm asking you, please. Enough with the blacklist. 

---

Don't you think?

---

## GERTRUDE:
Enough. Let's get rid of it and, maybe, we could get something else. 

---

Maybe we could have a whitelist? Or a blue list with white trim around the edges? 

---

What do you think?

---

## GERTRUDE:
Is that enough?... 

---

Thank you. Now, Your Eminence, do you think… I'm sorry, what did you just say?

---

... Do I like being Jewish? I suppose so. I mean, I'm Jewish. Whether I like it or not. 

---

That's who I am.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Have I ever thought about Catholicism? You mean converting?

---

... No, I can't say I have...

---

## GERTRUDE:
Your Eminence, I would respectfully say, "No, thank you" to that. I am who I am. 

---

I can't change that. Nothing could change that. Even if you yourself declared it.

---

## GERTRUDE:
I mean, what would be the point? You can call a cow a chicken, but it's not going to lay any eggs… 

---

No, I don't think there is anything else… 

---

I'm sorry to have taken up your time… 

---

Well, you're very kind... No, thank you... Goodbye.

---

## GERTRUDE:
I’m so sorry.

---

## PHILIP:
Shhhh.

---

## GERTRUDE:
I couldn’t do it. I’m such an idiot. I thought I could do it.

---

## PHILIP:
You tried.

---

## GERTRUDE:
I guess I can’t fix everything.

---

## PHILIP:
You tried. At least, you tried.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Oh... I don’t want to lose you.

---

## PHILIP:
Then don’t.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Let’s go back.

---

## PHILIP:
You’re not going to lose me, right?

---

## GERTRUDE:
We’ll talk later.

---

## PHILIP:
Gert...

---

## GERTRUDE:
We have to do the show.

---

## GERTRUDE: 
Walt? Let’s go back.

---

## WALTER:
Yes, Mrs. Berg. Call in the actors, please.

---

## PHILIP:
Gert, don’t leave me hanging here.

---

## GERTRUDE:
I have to think. We’ll talk later.

---

## PHILIP:
There’s nothing to talk about. My life is in your hands.

---

## GERTRUDE:
I’m just one person, all right? I can’t take care of everyone.

---

## PHILIP:
You don’t have to.

---

## GERTRUDE:
I have this show. I have everyone connected to it.

---

## PHILIP:
You’re going to be fine. You’re living up on Park Avenue.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Don’t throw that at me. I earned that apartment.

---

## PHILIP:
And if anyone was threatening it, I would lay down my life for you.

---

## GERTRUDE:
I know that.

---

## PHILIP:
So what are we doing here?

---

## GERTRUDE:
We have a show to do.

---

## PHILIP:
I know we have a show to do! I lose this, I got nothing.
---

## WALTER:
Places, please.

---

## PHILIP:
What are you going to do?

---

## GERTRUDE:
Please. Let’s finish the show. I don’t know what else I can do. 

---

## WALTER:
Places, please.

---

## WALTER:
Mrs. Berg?

---

## GERTRUDE:
Yes. From the phone call. On your toes, Darlings.

---

## WALTER:
And... Action.

---

## MOLLY:
Jake, darling. It’s Mr. Mendel calling all the way from Pincus Pines. Quick. Quick. It’s very long distance.

---

## MOLLY:
Jake. It’s Mr. Mendel...

---

## MOLLY:
Jake.

---

## MOLLY:
Jake.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Phil?

---

## WALTER:
Hold, please.

---

## PHILIP:
What am I doing here?!

---

## GERTRUDE:
Phil...

---

## PHILIP:
Just fire me already! Get it over with! 

---

You’ll save your show, I’ll throw myself under a bus, and everybody’ll be okay.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Don’t talk like that. Come here. Sit down.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Get him some water.

---

## GERTRUDE:
What do you want to do?

---

## PHILIP:
I want to work! What do you mean what do I want to do? I just want to work!

---

## GERTRUDE:
All right... All right. 

---

..We’ll figure it out.

---

## PHILIP:
We can’t figure it out. What am I going to do?

---

## GERTRUDE:
I don’t know. We’ll figure it out.

---

## WALTER:
Is there somebody I can call?

---

## PHILIP:
No. There’s nobody to call.

---

## ELI:
Phil. Here.

---

## WALTER:
Mrs. Berg. May I make a suggestion?

---

## GERTRUDE:
What?

---

## WALTER:
Maybe we should cancel tonight’s broadcast. Say there were technical difficulties. 

---

## GERTRUDE: 
We’ve never done that.

---

## WALTER:
We could put on one of the kinescopes.

---

## PHILIP:
You’d like that, wouldn’t you? 

---

Then you could tell Stanton that it was my fault the show was canceled and he can fire me for breach of contract.

---

## ELI:
Nobody’s going to get fired. Right, Gert?

---

## LARRY:
Mrs. Berg.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Yes, Larry.

---

## LARRY:
I changed my mind. I don’t want you to fire Phil.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Thank you for saying that, Larry.

---

## ARLENE:
Well, fine. Now we’ll all get fired.

---

## LARRY:
What do you care? You’re going to get your own show anyway.

---

## ARLENE:
And you’re not going to be on it.

---

## LARRY:
Who cares? I don’t want to be on it.

---

## ARLENE:
Good! Because you can’t act anyway.

---

## WALTER:
Can we get back to rehearsing?

---

## ELI:
There are other things besides rehearsing.

---

## WALTER:
Not on CBS at nine o’clock.

---

## LARRY:
I can act.

---

## ARLENE:
And you can’t dance.

---

## LARRY:
I can’t dance?! I can’t dance?!

---

## ELI:
You can’t just be about the job.

---

## WALTER:
Hey, I got a family to support.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Stop it!

---

## LARRY:
I won the All-Borough Swing Dancing Championship -

---

## GERTRUDE:
Stop it!

---

## LARRY:
- three years in a row!

---

## GERTRUDE:
Larry!

---

## GERTRUDE:
I never saw such a thing like this. Hollering? Fighting? Not in my family.

---

## ARLENE:
We’re not your family.

---

## GERTRUDE:
This is my family more than my own family is my family. I spend more time with this family than with my own family. 

---

I prefer to be with this family more than with my own family.

---



Why wouldn’t I? In this family, I get to write what everybody gets to say.

---



I don’t like confrontation. I don’t like controversy. I like things to be average. 

---

How I convinced Mr. Paley to put on a show with a family of Jews in it, I said, “It’s an average family.” 

---

Every show, there’s a little conflict. A little tension. Maybe a little wisdom. But no fighting.

---

## ELI:
Nobody wants fighting.

---

## GERTRUDE:
All right.

---

## ELI:
But And I think I speak for all of us - We do want to know what the hell you’re going to do.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Language.

---

## ELI:
Sorry.
As pertains to our current situation, we would all very much like to know, what are your thoughts?

---

## GERTRUDE:
What are my thoughts? I’ll tell you my thoughts. Eli... 

---

I’ll say this in a way that you’ll understand it... You’re a pain in my tuchas.

---

## ELI:
Okay.

---

## GERTRUDE:
And I wouldn’t have it any other way.

---

## ELI:
Okay.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Larry. You are a good dancer.

---

## LARRY:
Thank you.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Tell him he’s a good dancer.

---

## ARLENE:
You’re a good dancer.

---

## LARRY:
Thank you.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Arlene, if you aren’t happy here, I will let you out of your contract.

---

## ARLENE:
I just don’t want anyone calling me a Communist.

---

## GERTRUDE:
You want to do what I do? You want to have your own show? 

---

Then, as an artist, as a celebrity, as a woman, you have to be prepared to be called all kinds of things. 

---

You understand?

---

## ARLENE:
Yes.

---

## GERTRUDE:
And when you have your own show... 

---

You can’t tell anyone who works for you what to think, what to believe, what to read, what to wear, what kind of toothpaste to use. 

---

When you have your own show... 

---

Even if you write every word and star in every episode, you have to remember... 

---

It’s not about you. All that matters is we show gratitude for what we have and take care of everyone else. 

---

All right?

---

## ARLENE:

All right.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Occasionally, you have to make hard decisions.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Phil. You are a great actor. You’re such a great actor that you make me look like a great actor.

---

## PHILIP:
You are a great actor.

---

## GERTRUDE:
But you are more than an actor. You are a mensch. And you inspire me.  

---

I will not lie down for them either. I will not fire you.

---

## GERTRUDE:
I mean, how would it look if you weren’t on the show? 

---

People would think Molly and Jake got a divorce. It’s not possible.

---

## PHILIP:
It’s impossible.

---

## GERTRUDE:
So is that brave or crazy?

---

## WALTER:
I guess we’ll find out.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Are we ready for tonight?

---

## WALTER:
We should finish the run-through so I can get all the camera cues down.

---

## GERTRUDE:
All right, darlings. Let’s take it from where we left off.

---

## GERTRUDE:
On your toes, Darlings.

---

## WALTER:
And... Action.

---

## MOLLY:
Jake, darling. It’s Mr. Mendel. Calling all the way from Pincus Pines. Quick. Quick. 

---

It’s very long distance.

---

## PHILIP:
Thank you.

---

## JAKE:
Hello, Mendel?... Yes, what is it? 

---

Is everything okay?... Silverman? 

---

I don’t want to talk about Silverman. He took what didn’t belong to him and that’s that 

---

.... What?.. You told him to take the dresses? Why? ... To bring them to you to Pincus Pines to sell to some of the guests up there?... 

---

Well, why didn’t you tell me? 

---

....You forgot? You were in a hurry to get to Pincus Pines? Communication! Communication, Mendel! 

---

How many times do I have to tell you? ... No, of course. 

---

Of course he can come back to work. He’s one of our best workers.... 

---

All right, Mendel. Let this be a lesson to you ... 

---

All right, to me, too. All right.... I’ll see you tomorrow .. 

---

Yes. Goodbye.

---

## JAKE:
Molly, did you hear that?

---

## MOLLY:
I heard.

---

## JAKE:
I feel so badly that I accused Mr. Silverman for something he didn’t do.

---

## MOLLY:
Thank goodness, you can make it right.

---

## JAKE:
Oh, Molly.

---



Molly... How did Mendel know to call me from Pincus Pines?

---

## MOLLY:
I don’t know. Maybe he’s got Extra Sensory Perspiration.

---

## JAKE:
Or maybe a person called him so he knew what was going on?

---

## MOLLY:
You can’t blame a person for calling another person if it’s going to help another person.

---

## JAKE:
Oh, Molly. Molly takes care of everything.

---

## JAKE:
Maybe should I make you a partner.

---

## MOLLY:
You can’t make me a partner. We’re already partners.

---

## JAKE:
You’re right about that.

---

## MOLLY:
So I hope you all had a nice holiday and enjoyed the parades and the food and the fireworks. 

---

And when I say fireworks, you know what I mean, there are all kinds of fireworks.

---

## MOLLY:
The fireworks in the sky and the fireworks you got, maybe, in your own home.

---

## MOLLY:
And for when it starts to feel a little hectic, that's why I always have Sanka in the house. 

---

Regular or instant. Because Sanka has ninety-seven percent of the caffeine taken out and they leave in the sleep.

---

## MOLLY:
And you know what else Sanka is good for?... Sanka...

---

## GERTRUDE:
Sanka can cancel your TV show. Oh, yes. That's right. 

---

This is America so Sanka has the freedom to cancel your TV show.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Then you have the freedom to take your show to another network and find another sponsor. 

---

That sponsor has the freedom to tell you to replace one of your actors.

---

## GERTRUDE:
So you have the freedom to replace one of your actors. 

---

And the actor you replaced can't get any other work so that actor has the freedom... 

---

That actor has the freedom... To check into a hotel and take his own life.

---

## GERTRUDE:
And your show goes on until it's cancelled by the sponsor who has the freedom to cancel it. 

---

And you go on... You go on... Because this is America. And everyone has freedom... Freedom...

---

THE END
