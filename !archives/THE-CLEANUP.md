## RYAN:
And…we’re back.

---

## JULIE:
Welcome friends old and new to TLC Toy Cleaning Committee.

---

## RYAN:
The hands down funnest committee.

---

## JULIE:
You get to leave the house.

---

After dark.

---

## RYAN:
And you don’t have to do any fundraising.

---

## JULIE:
At least not while you’re cleaning.

---

## RYAN: 
I’m Ryan—Ryder’s dad.

---

## JULIE: 
I’m Julie—Jacob’s mom.

---

## RYAN: 
And this is what? Our fifth year—

---

## JULIE:
Sixth.

---

Non-consecutive—

---

## RYAN:
—Since we co-founded The Learning Co-Op.

---

Our older kids grew up here.

---

## JULIE:
They’re still nostalgic—

---

## RYAN:
For that TLC magic.

---

## JULIE: 
So let’s make it sparkle.

---

Grab some gloves.

---

## RYAN:
Enjoy an IPA.

---

Stole it from work.

---

## JULIE:
And cheers to the ’21-22 school year.

---

It’s…a relief to be back in the building.

---

## RYAN:
Let the cleanup begin.

---

## LOGAN: 
Here try this one.

---

## NICOLE:
Perfect.

---

I’m Nicole.

---

## LOGAN: 
Logan—Liesel’s dad.

---

## NICOLE:
My son is Eli.

---

Plus I have a baby at home, baby Emma.

---

## LOGAN: 
I’m eying that massive dollhouse.

---

Do we need to clean all of it.

---

Even the—

---

## JULIE:
Yes.

---

## NICOLE:
How d’you even play with this? Just arrange stuff? Gimme a blanket fort.

---

## LOGAN: 
We did a lot of blanket forts.

---

## NICOLE:
I still haven’t crawled out of mine.

---

Of course we’ll need those blankets back for fall.

---

Though tomorrow it’s supposed to warm up.

---

## LOGAN: 
Stop.

---

## NICOLE:
What?

---

## LOGAN:
Nicole.

---

You’re the only vaguely promising conversation partner in this room.

---

## NICOLE:
Vaguely? Gee thanks.

---

## LOGAN: 
Three hour shifts times 33 Sundays makes 99 hours of sanitizing.

---

Let’s not torture each other with mind-numbing weather chat.

---

## NICOLE:
What would you rather discuss?

---

## LOGAN:
Real stuff.

---

Substantive stuff.

---

## NICOLE:
After you.

---

## LOGAN:
Okay.

---

Well I used to work in building operations at a big downtown hotel.

---

Then the shutdown happened.

---

Got laid off.

---

Now I dabble in home repair, at which I’m moderately competent, and for which I undercharge out of guilt.

---

My soon-to-be-ex-wife is an ER doc.

---

So I have Liesel mornings, plus three or four nights a week.

---

So I’m full time parenting.

---

## NICOLE:
Sorry.

---

No.

---

Like I’m sure you’re awesome dad, but what you’re describing is not full time parenting.

---

I nurse five times a day, down from twelve.

---

I haven’t slept a full night in my bed or spent more than three hours apart from my baby since she was born.

---

This is my first time leaving the house after 6pm since March of last year.

---

## LOGAN:
And you came here?!

---

## NICOLE:
There’s nowhere else! Not for us, at least.

---

Not yet.

---

Driving here I experienced pure, unadulterated elation.

---

Boarding a jet to Europe at the end of a heist movie—that’s how it felt to be driving my banged-up Subaru full of Cheerio dust to this dilapidated church to clean doll furniture.

---

This is my first time leaving my husband with both children—ever.

---

## LOGAN:
Seriously? What the hell is wrong with him? 

---

## NICOLE:
And Eli…after five days of school, he's become a new kid.

---

The crying jags stopped.

---

He sleeps with his shoes on.

---

He hasn’t seen kids his age since the shutdown, which is thrilling.

---

## LOGAN:
And you get to do this, equally thrilling thing.

---

## NICOLE:
Beats sitting home looking at disaster photos.

---

Fires, mudslides, hurricanes.

---

## LOGAN:
Yeah.

---

I can’t watch the news anymore.

---

## NICOLE: 
Yeah.

---

No.

---

I’m a claims adjuster.

---

I’m describing my actual job.

---

Haggling with disaster victims as they sift through the ashes for heirlooms. Except, turns out tasks requiring hours of mental focus don’t mesh with soothing a screaming infant.

---

And, since securing multiple daycare slots is like hitting the Powerball, mothering is now my full-time job.

---

## LOGAN: 
What I should’ve said is co-parent.

---

I’m the one with the flexible—

---

## NICOLE:
Yeah, dude.

---

I get it.

---

And, I’m sorry about—

---

## LOGAN:
My divorce? Yeah, well, it’s going around.

---

## NICOLE:
Must be something in the air.

---

## LOGAN:
Honestly, I’m just here to kill time till my ex leaves for work.

---

We parent in shifts to avoid each other.

---

## NICOLE:
How long can you keep that up? 

---

## LOGAN:
I’ve adopted a “just for now” mindset.

---

## NICOLE:
That’s dangerous.

---

Cause when you make an unsustainable compromise two weeks of disruption become two years of survival mode.

---

I’m done with “for now.” I’m ready for next.

---

## LOGAN:
Yeah.

---

So what’s next for you?

---

## NICOLE:
Is it weird that I envy this mama triceratops? Where’s my Victorian clawfoot soaking tub?

---

## LOGAN:
I’ve got that exact tub at my cabin in Michigan.

---

Minus the dinosaurs.

---

I salvage antique fixtures from construction sites.

---

## NICOLE:
Of course you do.

---

## LOGAN: 
Hinges.

---

Doorknobs.

---

Faucets.

---

## NICOLE:
Oh, great.

---

## LOGAN:
What?

---

## NICOLE:
My milk let-down.

---

For a second I felt so free until: biology.

---

## LOGAN:
D’you need a place to pump? I have a key to the office.

---

## NICOLE:
I didn’t bring the gear.

---

But it’s fine.

---

Achy breasts are a small price to pay for my first in-person adult conversation in months.

---

## LOGAN:
You’re married, though?

---

## NICOLE:
Yeah, but for a long time our interactions haven’t exactly been… 

---

## LOGAN:
What?

---

## NICOLE:
Substantive.

---

## JULIE:
There you are.

---

## NICOLE:
Julie, hi.

---

Sorry I’m late.

---

I had to park kind of far.

---

## JULIE:
Snack starts in four minutes so we need to start prepping.

---

Not on the counters.

---

Not on the counters.

---

## NICOLE:
Sorry.

---

## JULIE:
Hands please.

---

The other sink.

---

It’s just the health department—

---

## NICOLE:
Right.

---

## JULIE:
We can’t take any chances.

---

## NICOLE:
Got it, really it’s fine.

---

I got four boxes of woven wheat crackers.

---

They didn’t have the sea-salt so I had to get cracked pepper.

---

I hope that’s not a problem.

---

## JULIE:
We’ll see.

---

## NICOLE:
For the beans.

---

I just—I got the giant can.

---

## JULIE:
Perfect.

---

## NICOLE:
And the kids they really—?

---

## JULIE:
Love it.

---

It’s the perfect high protein finger food.

---

## NICOLE:
Cool.

---

So is there a can opener—?

---

## JULIE:
Twenty kids, four to a table.

---

We used to do five plates of crackers and serve them each a spoonful of chickpeas 

---

but now we have to do individual servings so that’s twenty bowls—start with three crackers per bowl.

---

## NICOLE:
Okay—

---

## JULIE:
Gloves!

---

## NICOLE:
Right.

---

Sorry!

---

## JULIE:
It’s just that the teachers get a bathroom break when we bring out the snack.

---

They’re counting on us to take over at 10:05.

---

Right now it’s story time.

---

After that they line up for hand washing and proceed to their snack spots.

---

## NICOLE:
I peeked in when I got here.

---

It’s nice and peaceful in there.

---

## JULIE:
I wish I could be in there—I mean I am in there.

---

But, you know, as a kid.

---

## NICOLE: 
Really?

---

## JULIE:
Adults catering to your every need.

---

Not a care in the world.

---

## NICOLE:
I guess.

---

But the lack of control.

---

The helplessness.

---

The constant confusion.

---

## JULIE: 
Sure, but does that ever really go away? 

---

## NICOLE:
I mean, some of it.

---

## JULIE:
Wow.

---

These are peppery.

---

## NICOLE:
They were the only—

---

## JULIE:
You know I may have some plain woven wheats in that cabinet behind you.

---

## NICOLE:
Would you like me to—?

---

## JULIE:
I just worry these are so strong.

---

## NICOLE:
My kid likes pepper.

---

## JULIE:
So do mine.

---

But not every preschooler has such a sophisticated palette.

---

## NICOLE:
Next time I’m assigned kiwis.

---

Two dozen kiwis.

---

## JULIE:
Uh huh.

---

## NICOLE:
I was thinking.

---

How will I know if they’re ripe?

---

## JULIE: 
Story’s over.

---

Time to get out there.

---

## NICOLE:
Logan, hi.

---

## JULIE:
Go!

---

## LOGAN:
Well I snaked that toilet in the bathroom.

---

Found like four Shopkins down there.

---

## JULIE:
Did you tell the building it’s handled?

---

## LOGAN:
I texted them.

---

## JULIE:
The more we can fix ourselves.

---

## LOGAN:
You should’ve called this place DIY.

---

I bought you a mop.

---

By the way.

---

The old mop’s disgusting.

---

Putrid and moldy.

---

I threw it out.

---

## JULIE:
It wasn’t ours.

---

## LOGAN:
Good.

---

Well.

---

The church got an upgrade.

---

## JULIE:
What? Why are you looking at me like that?

---

## LOGAN:
Because you’ve got that fake, like, phony demeanor about you.

---

## JULIE:
How am I being fake right now? 

---

## LOGAN:
Julie.

---

I’ve known you ten years.

---

I know when you’re being fake.

---

## JULIE:
I’m not being fake; I’m being pleasant.

---

## LOGAN:
Mike won’t return my calls.

---

Did you tell him he couldn’t be friends with me?

---

## JULIE:
I think everyone’s trying to stay neutral.

---

If it helps, Mike still likes you better.

---

## LOGAN:
But do you like me better? Cause if you guys broke up, I’d choose you over him, frankly.

---

Granted, he has mellowed out since his accident; of course maybe that was the painkillers.

---

Or the hot physical therapist.

---

## JULIE:
Actually, that’s called emotional growth.

---

Our marriage is stronger than ever.

---

## LOGAN:
Yeah.

---

I thought that too, before you advised my wife to dump me.

---

## JULIE:
I made one innocent observation.

---

I didn’t know there was a whole…backstory.

---

## LOGAN:
Well what did you think was gonna happen?

---

## JULIE:
A discussion.

---

## LOGAN:
Cause you assume everyone’s like you.

---

## JULIE:
Like me how?

---

## LOGAN:
Rational.

---

Now if you’ll excuse me, I gotta go shower at the gym, cause I’m not allowed in the apartment when Katie’s home.

---

Hope I don’t catch anything.

---

## JULIE:
Logan, I’m sorry things are weird with our families right now.

---

But please know how grateful I am for your help.

---

## LOGAN:
I’m here solely to give my child a bit of normalcy.

---

If there were any better options, believe me we’d avail ourselves.

---

Enjoy the mop.



---

## LOGAN:
Need a hand?

---

## NICOLE:
I can’t get this dang thing to refold.

---

## LOGAN:
You’ve gotta step on the brake first.

---

## NICOLE:
I tried that.

---

## LOGAN:
Oh, I see these just need to be tightened a little.

---

And, ah, here’s our problem, this one is missing a screw.

---

I bet I’ve got one that’ll fit.
Nope, nope, yup.

---

Alright.

---

Good as new.

---

And see this button, it’s kind of hidden,  you have to know how to feel for it.

---

One hand up here, the other down here.

---

## NICOLE:
Why couldn’t I do that? I watched like three videos.

---

## LOGAN:
This scrap of fleece was caught in the hinge.

---

It’s clear now.

---

See.

---

Good as new.

---

## NICOLE:
My husband gave up.

---

He said it was toast.

---

## LOGAN:
What! No, this is a Cybex Priam.

---

The Bentley of strollers.

---

All-Wheel Suspension.

---

 Removable bumper bar.

---

 Lockable swivel wheels.

---

Rose gold frame.

---

## NICOLE:
I found it in the alley with a “free” sign.

---

## LOGAN:
It’s astounding what people discard.

---

Down at Galt Baby, you’re talking nine hundred, easy.

---

You have good taste, Nicole.

---

## NICOLE:
Only in strollers.

---

## LOGAN:
How was snack duty?

---

## NICOLE:
I bought the wrong crackers.

---

## LOGAN:
Don’t sweat it.

---

I was once told to bring jicama? But I didn’t realize it was supposed to be cut like a carrot stick.

---

I just brought three giant unpeeled jicama roots.

---

And Julie’s like, “What d’you expect me to do with these?”

---

## NICOLE:
“Snack starts in three minutes.”

---

## LOGAN: 
I had to carve them with a dull pairing knife.

---

Mangled the whole job.

---

Snack time ended.

---

The kids didn’t have anything to scoop up their mushed avocados with lime.

---

They were just licking it off of the plates.

---

Goo everywhere.

---

Epic snack fail.

---

## NICOLE:
Julie’s a little intense.

---

## LOGAN:
No comment.

---

## NICOLE:
Sorry, I should’ve realized.

---

You’re friends.

---

God I have terrible social skills.

---

## LOGAN:
Me, Julie and Ryan were all in a pod together, along with our spouses and our seven combined kids.

---

We live on the same block so…

---

## NICOLE:
Man, I wish I’d been in a pod.

---

## LOGAN:
No you don’t.

---

## NICOLE:
Dinner parties, playdates, watching each other’s kids while you work.

---

## LOGAN:
That.

---

Is how it was billed to me


---

## RYAN:
We finally make it to the park.

---

The party’s over.

---

The cupcakes were gone.

---

Ryder had a ginormous meltdown.

---

And I’m like, “Well, maybe if you hadn’t thrown your shoes out of the stroller—” 

---

## LOGAN:
Half of parenting’s just looking for shoes.

---

## RYAN: 
And the other half is chanting, “Put on your shoes.

---

Put on your shoes.

---

Put on your flipping— 

---

## LOGAN:
Why are you taking off your socks! It took forty minutes to put on those socks.

---

## RYAN: 
We’ve bought every obscure brand of sensory sock for Ryder.

---

He can’t tolerate any of them.

---

His SPD is so severe.

---

The OT says he’d do better in a full day preschool.

---

And TLC can be so chaotic.

---

## LOGAN:
Tell me about it.

---

## RYAN:
Play-based was great for our older kids.

---

It’s just not a fit for Ryder.

---

We applied a couple of places.

---

Don’t tell Julie.

---

She’d make it about her.

---

## LOGAN:
So then make it about you.

---

Tell her you have to go back to work.

---

Which is true.

---

## RYAN: 
So I shouldn’t confess how I’m dying to break out of this hell-loop of mandatory classroom rotations?

---

## LOGAN:
Yeah, I heard there was some drama between our kids on Friday.

---

## RYAN:
You mean when your kid started something with my kid?

---

## LOGAN:
Hey, that’s not how she said it went down.

---

## RYAN:
What went down was Ryder’s block tower, after Liesel came over and smashed it.

---

He’d spent all morning on that thing.

---

It was as tall as the art shelf.

---

He’s Louis Sullivan up on that chair—about to place the final block—Liesel saunters over, out of nowhere, and BAM! 

---

He leaps up into the air trying to catch the damn thing, falls, hits his head on a table.

---

The teacher goes running for an ice pack.

---

He’s crying.

---

Snot everywhere.

---

## LOGAN:
Yeah, but he built it with her blocks.

---

## RYAN:
They're community blocks.

---

## LOGAN:
He took apart her finished thing.

---

She had a whole city going on.

---

It’s common courtesy if somebody’s using something you don’t just walk off with it.

---

## RYAN:
Could you maybe just get her to apologize? He’s pretty upset.

---

## LOGAN:
No.

---

You build your tower with my blocks.

---

I knock down your tower and take back my blocks.

---

Know what that’s called? Natural consequences.
But speaking of being upset—

---

## RYAN: 
What?

---

## LOGAN:
Andrew is straight-up avoiding me.

---

## RYAN:
I don’t think he’s actively—

---

## LOGAN:
No.

---

Cause see now I have evidence.

---

## RYAN:
Evidence?

---

## LOGAN:
When he put an end to our long runs on Sunday.

---

He’s all, “I really prefer to go solo.” 

---

Told me he’s working on his “race pace." 

---

Then this morning I caught him with Katie—he was clearly curtailing his cadence.

---

## RYAN:
Well maybe she’s more cordial company.

---

## LOGAN:
Ah ha! So you’re admitting he’s taking her side.

---

Which is bullshit cause we were friends first.

---

He and I were the original friends.

---

Before any of the rest of us knew each other.

---

He threw the party where I met Katie.

---

And if I hadn’t gotten together with Katie none of us would’ve ever met Julie, and she would’ve never met Mike.

---

So actually, if you think about it in order of friendship seniority.

---

It goes: Me and Andrew.

---

Julie and Katie.

---

Me and Mike.

---

You and Andrew.

---

You and Me.

---

Me and Katie.

---

Us and Julie.

---

Mike and Julie.

---

And you’re telling me Andrew’s picking Katie cause she’s “cordial!” We grew up like cousins.

---

And raising our kids the same, until—

---

## RYAN:
Hey, whatever caused all this tension predates your divorce.

---

## LOGAN:
Well whatever it is I sure wish he’d say it to my face.

---

## RYAN:
Do you though? Do you really?





---

## NICOLE:
(Sings.)
♪ Clean-up, clean-up. ♪

---

♪ Every-body every-where. ♪

---

♪ Clean-up, clean-up. ♪

---

## NICOLE & LOGAN:
♪ Everybody do their share. ♪

---

## NICOLE:
I used to take the train every day.

---

## LOGAN: 
Yup.

---

Can’t say I miss it.

---

## NICOLE:
I do.

---

My life felt so full back then.

---

I had work friends and gym friends, and just like, regular friend-friends.

---

Slaying the whole working mama thing: pumping on my lunch break, strategic use of flex time.

---

And every weekend I’d take Eli to museums, concerts, the aquarium.

---

Concerts at the aquarium.

---

## LOGAN:
I wore Liesel in the Bjorn at Riot Fest when she was eight months old.

---

I got her those little baby earmuffs.

---

She’s been going to shows her whole life.

---

That might be the one thing I miss about the before-times.

---

## NICOLE:
For real? Cause I miss literally everything.

---

Kissing hello.

---

After work drinks at a crowded downtown bar.

---

6am spin class.

---

I miss all our friends who left the city and never came back.

---

But mostly, I miss who I got to be.

---

And, well.

---

There’s been a lot of conflict.

---

Especially once I stopped working.

---

## LOGAN:
What’s he do? Your husband?

---

## NICOLE:
Mortgage broker.

---

## LOGAN:
Ah.

---

## NICOLE:
His job is convincing people home’s a safe place for their money.

---

Mine taught me we’re one storm away from a reboot.

---

## LOGAN:
Reboots don’t have to be bad.

---

Case in point: I’m renovating a hundred year old lake-house my aunt passed down to me.

---

She’s alive, just couldn’t afford to own it.

---

And it was damaged—yes, in a storm.

---

A pipe burst, flooded the whole place.

---

Mold.

---

Broken windows.

---

Raccoons living in there.

---

I had to rip it all down to the studs.

---

Hauled out like eight dumpsters of debris.

---

And once it was standing empty, know what came into focus?

---

## NICOLE:
What?

---

## LOGAN:
My “next.”

---


Sitting on the front porch on a frosty morning with the steam wafting off of your coffee mug, watching the geese on the water.

---

Here’s that soaking tub.

---

I’m installing it this weekend.

---

First thing on my list.

---

## NICOLE:
No, no, no.

---

First thing on your list should be that branch.

---

## LOGAN:
What branch?

---

## NICOLE:
The one dangling over your power line.

---

See.

---

Like I always told my clients: never invest in the inside ’til you’ve mitigated risk on the outside.

---

Wind, water, ice.

---

It’s amazing what folks overlook.

---

Frayed wires.

---

Cracked foundations.

---

Improperly vented gas appliances.

---

Typically.

---

Our ruin.

---

Is in plain sight.

---

## RYAN:
We got a spot at Green Bean.

---

## JULIE:
Dammit.

---

This printer.

---

## RYAN:
A waitlist spot.

---

## JULIE:
There’s like ten jobs stuck in the queue—does nobody even—

---

## RYAN:
They called yesterday.

---

Full day preschool, meals included.

---

## JULIE:
I’m just gonna have to unplug it.

---

Ten, nine, eight, seven…

---

## RYAN:
Julie are you hearing me?

---

## JULIE:
Yeah.

---

I heard you.

---

Say you’re walking away from TLC.

---

Dumping me—weeks into the school year.

---

I thought we were partners, Ryan.

---

## RYAN:
I need full time work.

---

I can’t do it without full time daycare.

---

## JULIE:
We have eighty-six families depending on this school to exist until May.

---

## RYAN:
Then those people need to step the fuck up.

---

‘Cause I can’t work thousands of hours a year as an unpaid administrator so my four year-old can finger paint.

---

## JULIE:
Which is why I want to transition us into a real school.

---

With a capital campaign, and a building.

---

## RYAN:
And you, stretching yourself like Elastigirl, trying to bridge every gap in the tracks.

---

Come on, do you really wanna spend your life running this place? Who is it for?

---

## JULIE:
For the community.

---

To prove there’s a third path.

---

## RYAN: 
Well, my family can’t afford it anymore.

---

Neither can yours by the way.

---

Our kids needs are changing.

---

I need to respond with what’s best for them now—Violet’s begging to join a travel soccer team.

---

I can’t be in two places at once.

---

## JULIE:
Fine.

---

You don’t have to volunteer.

---

Except, obviously, the gala.

---

## RYAN:
No gala.

---

## JULIE:
But you’re the charming one.

---

I can’t host that auction alone.

---

## RYAN:
Julie, I consider you family.

---

But if we’re gonna remain friends, I have to make a clean break from the co-op.

---

I tried boundaries, they just didn’t work.

---

## JULIE:
But you’re staying on the board, right? You can’t quit.

---

You’re treasurer.


---

## RYAN:
I need you to be treasurer.

---

## LOGAN:
Fuck no.

---

## RYAN:
Look.

---

I already set up the spreadsheets for fall semester tuition.

---

Just pay the bills, track donations, do a quick update at board meetings.

---

Second semester invoices get mailed in January.

---

Contract renewal letters go out in March.

---

## LOGAN:
So you’re saying it’s a hundred things.

---

On top of the maintenance, the snack duty, and the endless requests for yarn.

---

## RYAN:
If you hate it so much why are you still on the board?

---

## LOGAN: 
I owed Julie a favor.

---

And, and, Liesel loves her friends.

---

After the year she just had, being back in the classroom.

---

It’s a gift.

---

## RYAN:
A gift from me: TLC co-founder.

---

So really—the least you could do—

---

## LOGAN:
The wheels on the bus go round and round, round and round, round and round.

---

The wheels on the bus go round and round, all through the town.

---

## RYAN:
That’s how they torture bad parents in hell.

---

## LOGAN:
Are we good for Saturday?

---

## RYAN:
Dunno.

---

I’ll probably be bogged down doing treasurer stuff.

---

## LOGAN:
Come on.

---

## RYAN:
Maybe we should just take a breather.

---

Not like you’re counting on the income.

---

## LOGAN:
Fine.

---

Fuck you.

---

I’ll be treasurer.

---

## RYAN:
Great.

---

Here’s the login info.

---

## LOGAN:
Seriously? Our bank password is “ForgingFriendshipsABC.”  

---

I wonder who erected that impenetrable bulwark.

---

## RYAN:
Be nice to her when I’m gone.

---

## LOGAN:
Is that another job you’re foisting onto me?

---

## RYAN:
No, that’s just manners.

---

## LOGAN:
Who’s gonna do the gala?

---

## RYAN:
Fuck if I know.

---

I asked Cindy, Kristen, the other Kristen.

---

The other Cindy.

---

## LOGAN:
Cause no one wants to go begging for donations.

---

Those women have jobs.

---

## RYAN:
I’m ecstatic to rejoin the ranks of the fully employed.

---

## LOGAN:
Wish I had the option, ‘cept my former boss won’t rehire me.

---

## RYAN:
We have a new buyer.

---

## LOGAN:
Well that’s something.

---

Vetted?

---

## RYAN:
A friend of a friend, with friends.

---

But it’s gonna mean more volume.

---

## LOGAN:
Okay.

---

I can do four outta seven for sure.

---

The rest we’ll see.

---

I may have to borrow your truck.

---

## NICOLE:
What’re you guys whispering about back here?

---

## RYAN:
Dad stuff.

---

## LOGAN:
Stroller repair.

---

## RYAN:
Splinter removal.

---

## LOGAN:
Paw Patrol.

---

## RYAN:
IPA? 

---

## NICOLE:
Still nursing.

---

Maybe next time.

---

## LOGAN:
Sadly, there won’t be a—

---

## RYAN:
Thanks.

---

For washing those napkins.

---

I know it wasn’t technically your week.

---

## NICOLE:
No problem.

---

Feels good to be making a contribution.

---

## RYAN:
Doesn’t it though? And speaking of contributions.

---

## LOGAN:
Ryan, no.

---

## RYAN:
We could really use some help planning this year’s Gala Auction.

---

## LOGAN:
Do not drag her into this—

---

## NICOLE:
What? Why not—

---

## LOGAN:
Because it’s—

---

## RYAN:
Easy.

---

Honest.

---

I’ve laid all the groundwork.

---

It’s really about, just, securing auction items—

---

## LOGAN:
Soliciting awkward favors—

---

## RYAN:
Coaxing parents—

---

## LOGAN:
The rich parents—

---

## RYAN:
—to package little luxuries.

---

Florida vacation rentals.

---

Backstage passes to Lolla.

---

## LOGAN:
Lay off, Ryan.

---

She doesn’t wanna do it.

---

## NICOLE:
I haven’t said that.

---

## RYAN:
Like there was this waterpark thing.

---

Private party at a brewery—that’s the brewery where I work, I’ll do that again.

---

Be a dead body on Chicago P.D.

---

## NICOLE:
For real?

---

## RYAN:
That surprisingly went for a lot.

---

Lemme tell you about the boot trick.

---

## LOGAN:
Don’t be a sucker, Nicole.

---

## RYAN:
At pick-up when everyone’s kneeling on the floor near the cubbies.

---

Grab the boots.

---

Her child’s boots.

---

Hand her the coat.

---

Put the boots on her kid, slowly, as you make the ask.

---

Her hands are full; she has to wait for you to finish.

---

You helped her.

---

Now she wants to help you.

---

Heuristic of reciprocity.

---

## LOGAN:
Mind games.

---

## NICOLE: 
Well, it would give me a reason to introduce myself to other parents.

---

## RYAN:
It’s the ideal ice breaker.

---

## LOGAN:
It’s countless hours of work.

---

## NICOLE:
Well, I’ve gotta earn my keep, right? We only pay 50 percent tuition—

---

## RYAN:
There’s no fine print on the sliding scale.

---

We founded this school cause half our friends work in the service industry.

---

They couldn’t afford the fancy daycares—

---

## NICOLE:
Ohmygod, like Green Bean.

---

## RYAN:
For example.

---

## LOGAN:
Pfff.

---

## NICOLE:
That place costs more than my college.

---

## RYAN:
Well, thank you, for taking this on—Madame Co-chair.

---

## NICOLE:
Wow.

---

I’m co-chair! Who’s the other—

---

## RYAN:
Julie.

---

## NICOLE:
Oh.

---

## RYAN:
And, of course, you’re excused from toy cleaning.

---

Instant promotion.

---

## NICOLE: 
But I love cleaning toys.

---

Or at least—

---

## RYAN:
The social aspect?

---

## LOGAN:
Goodnight, Ryan.

---

## RYAN:
Keep those files safe.

---

## LOGAN:
No promises.

---

Way to cut and run, by the way.

---

Real classy.

---

## RYAN:
Hey.

---

Whenever you're in trouble, just yelp for help!”

---

## NICOLE:
Did he name his son after the Paw Patrol character?

---

## LOGAN:
Ryder? No.

---

It’s from Brideshead Revisited.

---

That’s Andrew’s favorite book.

---

## NICOLE:
What’s it about?

---

## LOGAN:
False friends.

---

## NICOLE:
Chrysanthemums, comets, and dragon eggs?

---

## LOGAN: 
Hey.

---

Are you reading my super secret shopping list?

---

## NICOLE:
With burning curiosity.

---

## LOGAN:
A man’s gotta provide.

---

## NICOLE:
Relax, no judgment.

---

I just can’t believe I’m too old to even have heard of the club drugs.

---

Am I gonna have to just? Read about them? In The Atlantic? Like somebody’s mom?!

---

## LOGAN:
Come on.

---

No, it’s nothing like that.

---

It’s fireworks.

---

I bring ‘em back from Michigan; he sells ‘em.

---

Only the quality stuff.

---

## NICOLE:
That’s still illegal though.

---

## LOGAN:
Eh.

---

Wanna set some off?

---

## NICOLE:
Where?

---

## LOGAN:
I know how to get on the roof.

---

## LOGAN: 
Hey.

---

## NICOLE:
I was hoping I’d catch you.

---

## LOGAN:
Are you the last one?

---

## NICOLE:
Our ranks are dwindling.

---

We started with what, nine toy cleaners, tonight we got four.

---

## LOGAN:
Soon it’ll just be us.

---

## NICOLE: 
I wouldn’t object.

---

You’re the reason I keep showing up.

---

## LOGAN:
It’s not your commitment to cleanliness? Fidelity to the co-op?

---

## NICOLE:
Truthfully.

---

I’m not feeling real committed to much anything lately.

---

## LOGAN:
Ah.

---

Well, you wanna go somewhere and talk about it?

---

## NICOLE:
Yeah, no.

---

I have like maybe twelve minutes.

---

## LOGAN:
Any way I can be of service?

---

## NICOLE:
Perhaps.

---

## NICOLE:
Just careful, my boobs are super tender.

---

## LOGAN:
Better?

---

## NICOLE:
Perfect.

---

## LOGAN:
You have a fantastic body.

---

## NICOLE:
And you’re a really good kisser.

---

## LOGAN:
Yeah? 

---


[phone rings]

---

## LOGAN:
Shit.

---

It’s Julie, one second.

---

’Sup?

---

## JULIE:
Are you still in the office?

---

## LOGAN:
Yeah.

---

## JULIE: 
I was talking to Cindy on snack duty today.

---

She was saying she just, you know, she went back to work full time at her old firm—

---

## LOGAN:
Yeah, I already asked.

---

She’s not the kind of lawyer I need.

---

## JULIE:
Right.

---

Sorry.

---

I’m not recommending her.

---

She was saying something about being back at the top of the sliding scale.

---

We billed her full tuition, right?

---

## LOGAN:
I’d have to look that up.

---

But yeah, I mean whatever she says.

---

## JULIE:
Okay, it’s just.

---

On your spreadsheet they’re listed at 75%.

---

## LOGAN:
Could be a cut and paste error.

---

Are you in the doc now? Cause from here it looks like we’re billing them full.

---

And I don’t see you.

---

## JULIE:
Oh, shit.

---

Sorry.

---

I’m looking at 2019.

---

It’s been a long day.

---

I just found the current and—yup it’s up-to-date.

---

My bad.

---

Okay.

---

Well.

---

Thanks for handling all this.

---

You know I don’t like to get nosy with people’s financial situation.

---

## LOGAN:
Yeah.

---

It’s a pretty intimate thing.

---

## JULIE:
Well, goodnight.

---

## LOGAN:
Hey, sorry about that.

---

## NICOLE:
It’s fine.

---

I should’ve realized you have work.

---

## LOGAN:
No, no, no.

---

It’s not that.

---

It’s just.

---

## NICOLE:
What?

---

## LOGAN:
First off, Nicole, please know I find you insanely attractive.

---

Since the day you walked in here I had an immediate crush on you.

---

## NICOLE:
You’re not trying to say something reasonable and mature?

---

## LOGAN:
No.

---

Trust me, I’m neither of those things.

---

I just don’t want, later, for you to be like, “Fuck, that fucking guy.”

---

## NICOLE:
You’re sweet, but don’t all hook ups carry a thirty-three percent risk of that?

---

## LOGAN:
It’s just.

---

I have this crazy shared custody schedule, zero reportable income.

---

I’m prepping to move off the grid.

---

My house is a glorified campground.

---

I don’t even have towels.

---

Not ones fit for a woman—just the unicorn kind with a rainbow mane of glitter yarn.

---

## NICOLE:
Calm down, dude.

---

I’m not asking for towels.

---

I just wanted to make out a little.

---

## LOGAN:
And?

---

## NICOLE:
It was hot.

---

And now I have to rush home to nurse the baby.
You really have a crush on me?

---

## LOGAN:
Massive.

---

I’d just hate to see you sucked into my bonkers lifestyle.

---

## NICOLE:
It’s a trade up from quiet desperation.

---

## LOGAN:
Yeah, the thing is though, I’m not a good guy.

---

## NICOLE:
I feel like a good guy would say that.

---

## LOGAN:
Wouldn’t know cause I’m not one.

---

## NICOLE:
Prove it.

---

## LOGAN:
Okay.

---

## NICOLE:
To be continued?

---

## LOGAN:
You know where to find me.


---

## JULIE:
Did you cut this jicama yourself?

---

## NICOLE:
I used a mandolin.

---

## JULIE:
They’re the ideal shape for dipping.

---

Like adorable translucent French fries.

---

Nicole, you’ve become my star volunteer.

---

## NICOLE:
10:04.

---

Should we get out there?

---

## JULIE:
No rush.

---

We’re gonna let recess go longer because of the snow.

---

## NICOLE:
My kids were so excited.

---

I put Emma in her giant one piece snowsuit and brought her outside.

---

She just sat on a snow mound, squealing with glee.

---

‘Til Eli threw snow in her face and made her cry.
I really wanted my husband to take pictures.

---

I was doing the photobook for Emma’s first year and noticed: I’m not in a single picture with them both.

---

He wouldn’t even come outside.

---

Not even to see Eli’s snowman.

---

## JULIE:
Is he depressed?

---

## NICOLE:
Probably, but hell, so am I, and I still manage to zip up the snowsuits and wrestle on mittens.

---

Then I yesterday I went to the dentist, and I thought I’d perfectly timed it during nap.

---

But when I got home he was furious.

---

Emma refused to go down; screamed through his calls.

---

And I get it, because, that’s the whole reason I had to quit my job.

---

But also, the man has like zero interest in our children.

---

And they know it—they—
Also, I had this fantasy, with Eli in school part time, I’d slowly catch up on all the stuff I haven’t been able to do.

---

Get my driver’s license renewed, see a chiropractor about my weird shoulder pain, get my eyebrows done for the first time in two years.

---

But instead it’s just—relentless.

---

## JULIE:
I’ll take your kids tomorrow.

---

## NICOLE:
Really?

---

## JULIE:
Sure.

---

Jacob’s been begging for a playdate with Eli.

---

And check this out:

---

## NICOLE: 
“My Favorite Thing, by Eli: My favorite thing is school at TLC.

---

My best friend is Jacob.

---

We love trains.

---

We love dinosaurs.

---

We love each other.” 

---

## JULIE:
I met my own lifelong best friend in nursery school.

---

She lives in LA now.

---

But when my husband was in a car accident when our twins were ten weeks old she dropped everything, flew in, 

---

and took over my household for two months.

---

She cooked the meals, did the laundry, rocked the babies.

---

## NICOLE:
That’s a rare friend.

---

## JULIE: 
I just wish she didn’t live so far away.

---

At this age friendship can be—

---

## NICOLE:
Not as simple as mutual fascination with the fauna of the cretaceous period?

---

## JULIE:
Precisely.

---

Anyway, my maternity leave was over.

---

Being there for Mike’s recovery meant taking unpaid leave, meaning we couldn’t afford daycare.

---

So I downshifted at work and started a neighborhood babysitting swap.

---

One afternoon Ryan brought Violet for a playdate.

---

She had one of those chalkboards with alphabet magnets, and the kids were playing school.

---

We turned to each other and asked, “How hard could it be?” 

---

## LOGAN:
Bad judgement looks good on you.

---

## NICOLE:
Oh this? This is sleep.

---

I took a nap before I came here.

---

As for my judgement aren’t you the one who stands to benefit?

---

## LOGAN:
Hey, no scruples.

---

Let’s go.

---

## NICOLE:
Shhh.

---

There’s still like three people in there.

---

## LOGAN:
So we’ll be patient.

---

## NICOLE:
The baby is weaning.

---

## LOGAN:
Oh?

---

## NICOLE:
The past three nights she hasn’t asked for mommy milk.

---

Just wanted her pouches of lentils.

---

## LOGAN:
Wouldn’t be my first choice.

---

## NICOLE:
I’m considering a weekend away.

---

To kind of ease the transition to…nighttime independence.

---

## LOGAN:
Do you have a destination in mind?

---

## NICOLE:
Yeah, actually.

---

I’ve been hearing good things about this place up north.

---

## LOGAN:
Oh yeah?

---

## NICOLE:
In the woods, on a lake.

---

With coffee and geese and a really nice bath.

---

## JULIE:
How did the night weaning go? Did you use those earplugs I got you?

---

## NICOLE:
I knew I’d give in.

---

I had to go off the grid.

---

## JULIE:
Do whatcha gotta do.

---

How’d your husband handle the kids?

---

## NICOLE:
He didn’t.

---

He dumped them on his sister.

---

It was supposed to be Daddy-Emma bonding time.

---

He’s completely disengaged.

---

Compared to some of the dads here who are so involved.

---

I deserve that—they deserve that.

---

## JULIE:
So where’d you go?

---

## NICOLE:
A friend offered their place.

---

## JULIE:
I have a friend is operations manager at a luxury hotel downtown; when I weaned the twins he got me a room and I slept for two days.

---

## NICOLE:
Is that the hotel where Logan used to work?

---

## JULIE:
Yeah, Andrew was his boss.
How’s your shoulder pain?

---

## NICOLE:
Better.

---

Now it’s just brain fog.

---

I can barely remember my name.

---

## JULIE:
I had a work Zoom today.

---

Someone goes, “‘Jacob’s mom’ makes a good point.” That’s what I had typed in the square.

---

## NICOLE:
You’re still working? I didn’t realize.

---

## JULIE:
Just for now.

---

’Til I can transition into a salaried position here.

---

I’m ready to get out of finance.

---

My previous boss—she was a really dishonest person and she kind of stabbed me in the back—I was pregnant at the time, 

---

and she used my pregnancy as an excuse to exclude me from an opportunity that I’d been chasing for a long time.

---

Plus we were friends, I’m still kind of reeling from that.

---

You think you know someone… 
Meanwhile, my husband thinks I’m insane, running this place for free for six years.

---

But we’ve laid the groundwork: we have an alumni base; we have our reputation.

---

We’ll launch our capital campaign.

---

Buy our own building.

---

Expand into elementary.

---

And when I’m standing by the front door on a clear September morning greeting each child by name—

---

when I have a title, and a professional staff, the respect of the parents.

---

That will prove it was totally worth it.

---

## NICOLE:
You called it.

---

Everyone’s stopped showing up.

---

Whoa, whoa, whoa, what’re you doing with that bucket?

---

## LOGAN:
Preparing to clean all these toys by ourselves.

---

## NICOLE:
Can we not? Actually.

---

## LOGAN:
But isn’t it like a health department requirement?

---

## NICOLE: 
Are you a health inspector?

---

## LOGAN:
Ummm…What’re you doing?

---

## NICOLE:
We’ve got green, yellow, blue.

---

And a whole.

---

Lotta.

---

Pink.

---

## LOGAN:
You’re gonna make such a big mess.

---

## NICOLE: 
The kids get to do it.

---

Why not us? I’m thinking one foot pink and one green.

---

## LOGAN:
I guess that’s fine.

---

If you wanna be basic.

---

Me, I’m going with a two-tone color-block technique.

---

Left toes blue, right toes yellow.

---

Right heels blue, left heels yellow, and a bit of an ombre effect at the arch.

---

## NICOLE:
Wait.

---

Let me rescue my sweater.

---

## LOGAN:
You’re like a fecund, florescent Venus.

---

## NICOLE:
I get that a lot.

---

## LOGAN:
I’d like to frame you and mount you on my wall.

---

## NICOLE:
You don’t have walls.

---

## LOGAN:
Move in and I’ll build some.

---

## NICOLE:
Sorry.

---

For real? 

---

## LOGAN:
It just makes logical sense.

---

## NICOLE:
But can we just leapfrog all of the…stages?

---

## LOGAN:
You’re moving out anyway right? 

---

## NICOLE:
Yeah, but—

---

## LOGAN:
Hey, I’m not asking for a commitment.

---

I’m offering an alternative.

---

## NICOLE:
It’s just the timing— 

---

## LOGAN:
Is good.

---

I mean it’s not like your kids are in school yet.

---

## NICOLE:
Except this school.

---

Hello.

---

I’m involved.

---

Plus, I don’t wanna be dependent.

---

## LOGAN:
You’ll contribute.

---

I’ll contribute.

---

## NICOLE:
I don’t want to support you either.

---

## LOGAN:
I’m solvent.

---

And handy.

---

As I hope I’ve sufficiently demonstrated.

---

## NICOLE:
It’s a big transition for the kids.

---

## LOGAN:
To a childhood on the shores of a pristine woodland lake.

---

In the spring we’ll plant a garden.

---

In the summer we’ll fish.

---

In fall we’ll bake pies.

---

## NICOLE:
What I really need is to start working again.

---

## LOGAN:
We’ll convert that old tool shed into an office.

---

Go back whenever you’re ready.

---

I’ll handle the kids.

---

## NICOLE:
I used to feel so energized in the city, but now—all of it just seems so, optional.

---

## LOGAN:
The city will be here.

---

You’ll just be gaining warblers, and starlight, and trees.

---

## NICOLE:
Trees?

---

## LOGAN:
Which I will prune.

---

## NICOLE:
What kind of pies.

---

## LOGAN:
All of them: apple, blueberry, cherry.

---

## NICOLE:
Vented or latticed?

---

## LOGAN:
Vented.

---

Obviously.

---

The top crust is the whole point.

---

## NICOLE:
What a mess!

---

## LOGAN:
Fortunately for you.

---

I’m good with a mop.

---

## JULIE:
Hey mama! I got us a couple of lavender lattes.

---

## NICOLE:
Aww.

---

Thank you.

---

## JULIE:
They have CBD oil.

---

It’s three dollars more, but I was just like—what the hell, it’s Valentine’s day.

---

## NICOLE:
And, I’m officially separated.

---

It was our first conversation in months.

---

## JULIE:
How are you feeling?

---

## NICOLE:
Relieved.

---

He’s not clamoring for custody, opposite, but he did agree to spend more time with the kids—

---

starting with his sister’s wedding in March which also happens to be the weekend of our gala—

---

meaning I’ll be kid free and I can totally focus.

---

I just hate that it’ll be on Zoom.

---

I was hoping they’d have the vax for littles by now.

---

## JULIE:
We’ll make it work.

---

Party of two.

---

## NICOLE:
It’s nice to have something to look forward to.

---

Thanks for this.

---

I feel chiller already.

---

## JULIE:
Well, I figured today might be a tough one.

---

## NICOLE:
Me too, but weirdly, I’m okay.

---

My son gave me a big construction paper heart.

---

## JULIE:
I know.

---

I helped him make it.

---

And the pasta bracelet.

---

## NICOLE:
Which I am proudly wearing right now—turquoise is my favorite.

---

## JULIE:
We weirdly ran out of pink paint.

---

## NICOLE:
Stupid supply chain issues—

---

## JULIE:
Are the mother of invention.

---

Year after year you’re churning out petal pink pasta bracelets.

---

Circumstances change.

---

Boom: a Pantone bridge of painted paccheri.
Why don’t you come over for a girls’ night after your kids are down.

---

We’ll order Thai food and watch Bad Moms. 

---

## NICOLE:
Ooh.

---

I love Bad Moms. And, also.

---

I have some more news.

---

Girls’ night appropriate news.

---

Surprising, maybe—but also, happy.

---

I think.

---

## JULIE:
Sounds intriguing.

---

Oohh, also, you can finally meet Katie.

---

She’s making her chocolate cheese cake.

---

## NICOLE:
Liesel’s mom, Katie?

---

## JULIE:
Yeah.

---

It’s also her first Valentine’s since her separation.

---

She’s excited to meet you.

---

It’s crazy how much you're alike.

---

She got to know your kids at their last few playdates at my house.

---

She taught them to make those paper snowflakes.

---

## NICOLE:
Oh.

---

I didn’t realize.

---

## JULIE: 
Don’t worry.

---

We’re all being careful, but I figured, our kids are all in the same classroom.

---

We can still wear masks if you want.

---

## NICOLE:
No, it’s true.

---

We share exposure.

---

## JULIE:
She’s having a rough time, for obvious reasons.

---

## NICOLE:
I’m sorry to hear that.

---

## JULIE: 
She’s an ER doctor—which took her, you know, like twelve years to get to that point—

---

not to mention having an unexpected baby during her residency.

---

## NICOLE:
Wow, so they weren’t even—?

---

## JULIE:
No.

---

But he was really into it.

---

He needed a purpose.

---

Or a project at least.

---

He's a project guy.

---

So she finaaaally becomes a full fledged doctor, and covid happens.

---

Her mentor dies on a ventilator, weeks before they ship the first shots.

---

She’s bereft.

---

Two months later, she and Logan split up.

---

## NICOLE:
What happened there, exactly?

---

## JULIE:
Well, I really shouldn’t get into it.

---

## NICOLE:
Did they just lose the spark or…?

---

## JULIE:
No.

---

…No.

---

Opposite.

---

It’s clear they’re still…pining.

---

They may even still—well.

---

I shouldn’t speculate.

---

But, no.

---

It was a hundred percent about money.

---

You two should connect.

---

She’s been doing tons of research about financial settlements.

---

## NICOLE:
They don’t have one yet?

---

## JULIE:
(Lowering her voice.)
Well.

---

It’s tricky.

---

She has the bulk of their reported income, but also, she has like two hundred grand in student debt.

---

Logan, on the other hand, has no official income since he got laid off.

---

His handyman stuff, plus, God knows what else, that’s for cash.

---

She has zero idea what he made last year.


---

But, their big asset: His aunt retired and gave them that lake house in Michigan—as a wedding present.

---

It’s marital property.

---

Which he denies.

---

He’s getting all the labor on the remodel in trade.

---

But the land alone is worth three times more than their condo, which he wants her to “buy him out” of, which is bullshit.


---

But she’s stuck—she can’t work without childcare.

---

She does three-twelve hour overnights a week so she can spend her afternoons and weekends with Liesel.

---

He sleeps over and stays until nap.

---

Then he has the audacity to argue for primary custody on the grounds she's at work too much.

---

How gross is that?

---

## NICOLE:
Well there must be more to it than that.

---

## JULIE:
Clearly.

---

Cause every time she tries to kick him out he just gives her those puppy dog eyes and it’s like she forgets he’s being actively shitty.


---

What’s your Thai food order again? Red curry tofu extra spicy?

---

## NICOLE: 
About tonight.

---

I think I’m just gonna stay home.

---

Emma’s molars are coming in and she’s been super clingy at bedtime.

---

## JULIE:
No.

---

You can’t just dangle mysterious news and then bail.

---

Give her some teething tablets.

---

Let me book you a sitter.

---

My treat.

---

Solidarity plus cheesecake!


---

## LOGAN:
Happy Valentine’s Day.

---

## NICOLE:
What are these?

---

## LOGAN:
They’re snowshoes.

---

## NICOLE:
Oh.

---

Thank you?

---

## LOGAN:
I got Eli some too.

---

I was thinking you could bring the kids up for the President’s Day weekend.

---

We’ll explore the woods.

---

Emma can ride on my back.

---

Liesel’s been begging to make s’mores.

---

I can dust off the old guitar.

---

## NICOLE: 
I wish you’d brought this up sooner.

---

Julie’s family invited us skating.

---

## LOGAN:
So you’re choosing a two hour ordeal at the skate ribbon, most of which will be wasted standing in the damn rental line, over three blissful days of family time?

---

[Silence]

---

You do realize she’s grooming you to be her new unpaid second in command.

---

## NICOLE:
Don’t make it sound so sinister.

---

## LOGAN:
All I’m saying is she’s very effective at plugging people into her own personal agenda.

---

I’ve seen her do it before.

---

Hell, she’s done it to me.

---

## NICOLE:
What d’you mean?

---

## LOGAN:
Does she ply you with unsolicited favors? 

---

## NICOLE:
I wouldn’t call that plying.

---

I think it’s called friendship.

---

## LOGAN:
It’s a tactic called favor debt.

---

## NICOLE:
No.

---

If anything she acts like she’s in my debt.

---

## LOGAN:
That’s the tactic.

---

Making you feel like she can’t run the school without you? 

---

## NICOLE:
Well she literally can’t.

---

I’ve been doing a ton.

---

And she’s super grateful.

---

## LOGAN:
Has she tried to get you on the board yet?

---

## NICOLE:
It’s come up.

---

And actually, I’m considering it.

---

## LOGAN:
She needs votes to move forward with her “official head of school” campaign.

---

## NICOLE:
She should be head of school; and it should be a paying position.

---

## LOGAN:
See that’s where it gets messy.

---

How do you know where the friendship ends and the transactional stuff begins? She’ll do anything to retain volunteers.

---

Like there's this psycho thing where she’ll like take photos of people with their kids, 

---

and then later present them as gifts.

---

Do you think she’d keep being your friend if you weren’t so involved with TLC? It’s a friendship of proximity.

---

Do you really want to spend the next three years of your life portioning out fruit slices in exchange for cheap praise? I thought you were ready for next.

---

## NICOLE:
Yeah.

---

Except, I don’t quite know what next even looks like.

---

## LOGAN:
It looks like moving forward.

---

Blending our households.

---

Stabilizing our schedules.

---

I’ll sort out my custody stuff—

---

## NICOLE:
Wait, wait, wait.

---

Are you saying you want us to move in to help with optics in your custody negotiations?

---

## LOGAN:
No.

---

I want you to move in because I have never gotten along so well with another human being in my life.

---

It’s so easy with you, Nicole.

---

## NICOLE:
Or maybe it feels that way, since our relationship’s limited to sex and emotional connection.

---

Minus the stressors.

---

## LOGAN:
Except what are those things if not an antidote to life’s stressors? Have you been feeling better since we started seeing each other? 

---

## NICOLE:
Obviously yes, Logan.

---

I do feel a million times better than I did in September.

---

But also it coincides with a lot of positive developments in my life, including leaving quarantine, 

---

making friends, ending a loveless marriage, sleeping through the night, 

---

bullet journaling, getting a therapist, and cardio-dance class on Zoom.

---

It’s not like, a hundred percent cause: your dick.

---

## LOGAN:
So you’re saying that’s more like eighty percent?

---

## NICOLE:
What ended your marriage, Logan?

---

## LOGAN:
Difference of opinion.

---

## NICOLE:
Did you have sex and emotional connection?

---

## LOGAN:
I mean…it was a fucked up dynamic.

---

## NICOLE:
But you had those things—

---

## LOGAN:
To an extent, sure.

---

## NICOLE:
What happens when we disagree?

---

## LOGAN:
Nicole, did I do something to upset you?

---

## NICOLE:
It’s almost springtime.

---

Do you have an actual plan?

---

## LOGAN:
Yeah.

---

Plant the garden, finish installing those solar panels.

---

Maybe do a little woodworking.

---

## NICOLE:
You’re describing a Sunday afternoon.

---

What’s your plan for settling your divorce.

---

Work.

---

Parenting.

---

Kindergarten.

---

All the big stuff in your very immediate future? You stay over three nights with your ex—

---

## LOGAN:
Babe, I’ve told you, that’s all just for now.

---

## NICOLE:
And what about work? Money? Income?  

---

## LOGAN:
Don’t worry about me.

---

I’m enterprising.


---

## LOGAN:
Thanks for making the trip.

---

## RYAN:
I enjoy a solitary drive.

---

## LOGAN:
Hey, any time you guys wanna bring the kids up for the weekend.

---

## RYAN:
I know.

---

Everything’s just so busy with work since I’m back to full time.

---

## LOGAN:
How’s Ryder liking his new school?

---

## RYAN:
He loves it.

---

Routine’s really good for his sensory stuff.
Well, the house is really coming along.

---

Those wooden beams.

---

## LOGAN:
Original! All I did was expose them.

---

## RYAN:
And the kitchen is stunning.

---

## LOGAN:
Those tiles are all salvaged.

---

## RYAN:
Yeah, but that Viking range.

---

That can’t all be coming from this.

---

## NICOLE: (off)
Logan, do you have any tweezers?

---

Liesel got a big splinter in her…toe.

---

Hey.

---

## RYAN:
Hey.

---

## NICOLE:
You didn’t mention that Ryan was coming.

---

Are you staying for lunch?

---

## RYAN:
Nah, I’m just doing one final pickup.

---

## NICOLE:
Getting out of the explosives game?

---

## LOGAN:
He’s quitting to spend more time with his family.

---

## NICOLE:
Logan, she’s asking for you.

---

## LOGAN:
It’s good to see you, Ryan.

---

Bring the the kids next time.

---

I’ll make pie.

---

## NICOLE:
Hey, umm…could you maybe not…?

---

## RYAN:
I respect your privacy, if not your choices.

---

## NICOLE:
My choices are none of your business.

---

I just want what you already have.

---

My children’s father has been breaking their hearts in slow-motion.

---

Whereas, Logan, in one weekend, taught Eli to tie his shoe, zip his coat, 

---

and flip a pancake—they even played CandyLand—for over an hour.

---

## RYAN:
I have an eight minute CandyLand limit.

---

## NICOLE:
Yeah, it’s next level.

---

Is it messy? Of course.

---

But at least with him I can be authentic.

---

I don't have to pretend like I have it together.

---

And I am just really sick of pretending.

---


## RYAN:
Then stop.

---

Make that choice.

---

## JULIE: 
“Hello TLC Community.

---

Welcome to our 2022 March Virtual Gala.

---

I’m Julie, Jacob’s mom, joined by my new cohost, Nicole, mother of Eli.”

---

## NICOLE:
“Delighted to be here.”

---

## JULIE: 
“We’re gonna kick off tonight’s festivities with a video montage of our littles in action, shot and edited by Mya’s Grandma Sophie.

---

Then we’re going to move on to some TLC themed bingo.”

---

## NICOLE:
“Check your email for your randomized bingo card to play along at home for a chance to win fabulous prizes…”

---

## JULIE:
“Like these fleece blankets embroidered with The Learning Co-Op’s motto: ‘Forging Friendships through Collaborative Play.” 

---

And of course, the auction, which we’re taking high tech this year.

---

Nicole, will you talk us through it?”

---

## NICOLE:
“Happily.

---

So everyone should’ve gotten a link with their tickets to the app where you’ll be able to bid in real time.

---

We’ll be highlighting items throughout the evening.” 

---

I’ll have that all on my tablet by the way.

---

## JULIE:
And then we start the video.

---

Somehow.

---

## NICOLE:
Don’t worry, I have it in my dropbox.

---

## JULIE:
Awesome awesome.

---

Did your ex take the kids to that wedding?

---

## NICOLE:
They left this morning—back Monday.

---

## JULIE:
Wanna grab a kid-free dinner? We could try that new Italian place.

---

## NICOLE:
I kind of feel like a solo drive.

---

Ooh, do you wanna see Eli in his suit?
Wish I hadn’t altered the bridesmaid dress.

---

Check it out.

---

It’s a full on ballgown.

---

## JULIE:
♪ Cinderella dressed in yella went upstairs to kiss a fella… ♪ 

---

## NICOLE:
♪ Made a mistake and kissed a snake… ♪ 

---

## JULIE & NICOLE:
♪ How many doctors did it take? ♪ 

---

## JULIE:
Wear it tomorrow.

---

Let’s go full throttle Princess-core.

---

## NICOLE:
I’ll do it if you do it.

---

## JULIE:
Done.

---

Planning this auction with you has been a dream, Nicole.

---

## NICOLE:
Aww, thank you.

---

## JULIE:
And, I wanted to do a little something to reciprocate.

---

## NICOLE:
Ooh, a present.

---

## JULIE:
So, I hope you don’t mind.

---

But I took these candid photos of you and the kids on the playground.

---

## NICOLE:
Whoa, these look professional.

---

## JULIE:
Cause you’re so radiant.

---

I love this one of Emma on the slide; her precious baby cheeks.

---

And Eli on the swings.

---

Look he’s mid-laugh.

---

The three of you on the see-saw.

---

This one is my favorite.

---

## NICOLE:
Oh, Julie.

---

## JULIE:
So when you come out the other side of this—you and your kids.

---

I just wanted to show you.

---

You got this, mama.

---

## NICOLE:
Based on what, though?

---

## JULIE:
Everything.

---

You’re caring, conscientious, community minded.

---

## NICOLE:
Wait, isn’t how you were described in The Washington Post’s “On Parenting” section—

---

turned pull-quote on the TLC website’s “About” page.

---

## JULIE:
Sure.

---

Maybe that’s where I got it, but you’re doing it.

---

You’re here: Making space for your children to thrive.

---

## NICOLE:
I believe that’s on your brochure.

---

## JULIE:
Yeah.

---

Cause that’s our mission.

---

## NICOLE: 
What if I told you that isn’t my mission? That I’m here for all the wrong reasons? 

---

## JULIE:
You organized the auction.

---

## NICOLE:
As an excuse to get out of the house.

---

## JULIE:
Which you deserve.

---

There is no shame in needing “you time.”

---

## NICOLE:
Of course there’s no shame.

---

I don’t feel the least bit of shame.

---

I love Emma and Eli infinity.

---

But the work of mothering.

---

The stupid, bullshit, unpaid, unnoticed, million-and-one tasks a day.

---

Nobody talks about this—nobody tells you.

---

## JULIE:
Even if they did, would anyone really get it?

---

## NICOLE:
My whole identity just—

---

## JULIE:
Bled off the page like watercolors in the rain? Nicole, that happens to everyone.

---

Every new mother.

---

It’s earth shattering.

---

And it blows.

---

And the first two years, three years, five years are an identity desert.

---

And then…you regroup.

---

## NICOLE:
Have you regrouped? 
Would you still even wanna be friends with me if I wasn’t community minded? 

---

If I drop the performative caring?
At parent-teacher conferences.

---

I sat down at that tiny table in the tiny chair and the teacher read her report about Eli.

---

And I couldn’t even hear what she was saying cause my brain was just like, 

---

“Wait? I’m the parent at this parent-teacher conference? 

---

I’m supposed to expose him to various phonemes—I’ve never heard of a phoneme.”

---

## JULIE:
I have a great app; I’ll text it.

---

## NICOLE:
Of course you do.

---

Even if you didn’t start a preschool, you’d still have that app because you’re one of those moms.

---

## JULIE:
Those moms?

---

## NICOLE:
You know.

---

Your kids are snacking on broccoli and singing in French and all their toys are wooden and their clothes are made of bamboo 

---

and they play the violin and also, somehow, chess, even the four year-old.

---

Meanwhile, my kid’s sticking the bishop up his nose.

---

You have a special shelf just for library books so they don’t get mixed up with the non-library books.

---

Your daily planner looks like a freaking illuminated manuscript.

---

You compost.

---

And your hair smells like goddamned apricots.

---

## JULIE:
I mean, it’s JĀSÖN conditioner from Whole Foods.

---

Anyone can smell this way.

---

## NICOLE:
Sure.

---

Anyone could do any one of those singular things.

---

But the full suite? Everything is just flowing for you.

---

I will always lose the library books.

---

I don’t want to know about phonemes.

---

I don’t want to be conscientious.

---

And I definitely don’t want to do all this by myself.

---

## JULIE:
You won’t have to.

---

## NICOLE:
That’s easy for you to say.

---

## JULIE:
It would be.

---

But I’m actually here.



---

## LOGAN:
Hey, beautiful.

---

## NICOLE: 
Hey.

---

I feel so rested.

---

## LOGAN:
We’ve been sleeping a long time.

---

## NICOLE:
It’s so quiet up here.

---

## LOGAN:
It’s the snow.

---

It snowed all night.

---

Check it out.

---

All the trees are coated in ice.

---

## NICOLE:
What time is it?

---

## LOGAN:
Umm.

---

Two-fifteen.

---

## NICOLE:
What? Why didn’t you wake me up.

---

## LOGAN:
Cause I was sleeping too.

---

## NICOLE:
Wow.

---

It’s like Elsa switched on her freezing magic.

---

My car is just—buried—it’s practically up to the windows.

---

## LOGAN:
Don’t worry.

---

You’ve got plenty of time to get back.

---

## NICOLE:
The roads will be terrible.

---

## LOGAN:
So you’ll go slow.

---

Get your stuff, I’ll dig you out.

---

## NICOLE:
Save it.

---

Go use your big muscles to dig.

---

## LOGAN:
So the bad news: Our cars are frozen in place.

---

The tires are fully encased.

---

## NICOLE:
Well, do something, cause I gotta get back for the gala.

---

## LOGAN:
It’s on Zoom, right? Zoom in.

---

We have WiFi.


---

[frozen branch cracking]

---

[A crash]

---

[electric sizzling]

---

## NICOLE:
You never pruned that goddamned tree?! I caught that in September, it’s March! 

---

## LOGAN:
I was trying to get the house ready for you and the kids.

---

## NICOLE:
It was the one thing I specifically asked you to do.

---

## LOGAN:
On the plus side.

---

This is a golden opportunity to fire up the wood burning stove.

---

Glad I spent all winter chopping.

---

## NICOLE:
Well I spent all winter planning this gala.

---

Which starts in four hours.

---

It’s all on my laptop.

---

## LOGAN:
Julie will manage.

---

To quote the aforementioned queen, “Let it go.”

---

## NICOLE:
Okay, first off: That isn’t the message of Frozen.

---

Opposite.

---

Second, you literally sent an all-school email, as treasurer, on how the co-op relies on the gala to cover year-end expenses.

---

How are you not more concerned?

---

## LOGAN: 
Experience.

---

Somebody always steps in.

---

## NICOLE:
And that someone is gonna be me if we can’t close that gap.

---

## LOGAN:
Babe, I cautioned you, “Don’t get roped in.”

---

## NICOLE:
I am participating in a cooperative effort to educate and socialize our children.

---

## LOGAN:
I think you should text your / regrets—

---

## NICOLE:
Damn it got cold in here fast.

---

## LOGAN:
Draw a hot bath.

---

I’ll make Irish coffee and heat up that venison stew.

---

## NICOLE:
Wow.

---

Your whole life is just one fantasy after another.

---

## LOGAN:
And that’s bad cause—? 

---

## NICOLE: 
We’re the grown-ups.

---

We’re in charge.

---

## LOGAN: 
Come to think of it.

---

There may be a gas powered generator out in the shed.

---

With some luck I could get it up and running.

---

## NICOLE:
Goodbye, Logan.

---

We’re all done.

---

## LOGAN:
Done talking or done…done? Nicole, there’s sixteen inches of snow and we’re 3.

---

8 miles from the highway.

---

## NICOLE:
Good thing you taught me to snowshoe.

---

## LOGAN:
Babe, it’s subzero out there.

---

## NICOLE:
Yeah, but the thing is.

---

I’m feeling very committed right now.


---

## JULIE:
Good evening, and welcome to TLC’s first ever virtual gala.

---

My cohost isn’t here.

---

If anyone’s heard from Nicole, please alert me in the chat.
So, I see there are a LOT of you who tuned in tonight.

---

A lot.

---

Awesome.

---

We have so much good stuff to auction off.

---

And we have a heartwarming video, except I don’t have actually have that file so.

---

Mya’s Grandma if you’re watching maybe you can help me with that.

---

You know what.

---

I’m just gonna dive right in.
And the first item is.

---

…Compost.

---

You know what? Actually.

---

Let’s start with a more exciting one.

---

A 4-night golf getaway at Grand Geneva Resort.

---

What a fantastic item.

---

Okay, since I don’t have the nifty auction software why don’t you text your bids to my phone.

---

I’m putting my number in the chat.

---

And.

---

Let’s start the bidding at $750.

---

Remember this includes golfing.

---

Fun.
Wow.

---

So many of you are texting me.

---

But you’re all texting me $750.

---

Maybe bid more.

---

There we go, a thousand dollars.

---

Okay, eleven hundred.

---

Keep going.
Shoot.

---

So your contacts aren’t saved in my phone so—folks who are bidding— 

---

please put your names in your texts cause I am getting a lot of texts right now.
Wow.

---

Like three of you are named Brian.

---

And everyone’s bidding the same amount, you have to bid up—there we go, $1800 from Brian with the 630 area code.

---

$2200 from Bryan with a “Y.” Okay I think that’s it.

---

Anyone else? Cool.

---

Just sixteen more items to go.

---

Should we maybe take a little bingo break?
I’ve always wanted to use a bingo wheel.

---

This is fun.

---

And the first clue.

---

Are they called clues? I don’t really know.

---

“Have you ever brought kiwis for snack?” If you’ve ever brought kiwis for snack mark your bingo cards.


---

Actually, you know what? Cindy Torres are you watching? 

---

I’m gonna try and make you co-host so you can describe this next item, which is a chance to see fossils with a real life paleontologist.

---

What a cool job.

---

Cindy.

---

## CINDY:
Julie, hi.

---

You’ve got the wrong Cindy, this is Cindy Kim.

---

## JULIE:
Oh, sorry.

---

Maybe this is her in the box that says Izzy’s mom.

---

Cindy?

---

## KRISTEN:
Julie, sorry this is actually Kristen, Izzy P’s mom.

---

Izzy T’s mom is out of town right now; her dad’s having surgery.

---

## CINDY:
Julie, I donated the Mommy Needs a Break Ultimate Self-Care Retreat.

---

I could talk about that.

---

## JULIE:
Yes, please that would be great.

---

## CINDY:
I’m not dressed for Zoom though, I’m watching this from my Peloton.

---

## JULIE:
Hey, I’d be watching this from bed if I wasn’t here hosting.

## CINDY:
So unfortunately, The Tranquility Wellness Center is closed because of Omicron.

---

But you can still experience their world class, expert-guided, self-care retreat at home where you’ll learn how to tap into your limitless spiritual aquifer of inner calm.

---

Oops, gotta go.

---

My child just threw up on the cat.

---

## JULIE:
Wow, a Self-Care retreat that comes to you.

---

Pamper yourself and still not skip cleaning-up vomit.

---

And… Good news, folks.

---

It looks like we do have that heartwarming video after all.

---

[Sentimental music]

---

## NICOLE’S VOICE: 
*“The Learning Co-Op: Forging Friendships through Collaborative Play.*

---

*In these turbulent times we need our community more than ever.”*

---

[door slams]

---

## RYAN:
Where the fuck is she?

---

## JULIE:
Aww.

---

You’re wearing a tux.

---

## RYAN:
I always dress up for the gala.

---

## JULIE:
Six months of planning and she ghosted me?! I’m humiliated in front of everyone I know.

---

There’s a twenty-person text chain mocking me in real time—to which I was ‘accidentally’ added.

---

There are board members on there! 

---

## RYAN:
People are assholes.

---

## JULIE:
I’m done, Ryan.

---

I just wanna to crawl into bed with my husband, stream F-Boy Island, and scarf a whole pyrex of bake-sale brownies—sorry not sorry Cradles to Crayons…

---

I mean, obviously, I’ll write them a check.

---

## RYAN:
Sure.

---

## JULIE:
I’m not heartless.

---

It’s just: why put ourselves through this charade? Can’t we just help each other without the pointless busywork and the endless emails? This whole system is bullshit!

---

## RYAN:
Right? If it’s not the school it’s the church, or the soccer team.

---

And our family is so conspicuous I feel like I have to be a model father at all times.

---

As if the judgement of the world relies on whether I sent those empty egg cartons for the craft project.

---

## JULIE:
And now I’m remembering the dozens of times I asked you for yarn.

---

## RYAN:
Yeah, what’s up with yarn in this place, it’s like the Bermuda Triangle of yarn.

---

## JULIE:
Can we please just go home now?

---

## RYAN:
And let the haters win? Hell no.

---

We’re doing this auction.

---

And it’s gonna be the best year yet.

---

I just need to print out some notes.

---

## RYAN:
Does nobody ever put paper in this thing?

---

## JULIE: 
Hurry we have like three minutes.

---

## RYAN:
Of course there’s old spreadsheets stuck in the queue.
Umm.

---

I’m sorry, Jennifer G.

---

is definitely not paying less than 100%.

---

Girl left a Cybex Priam in the Freebox.

---

## JULIE:
She left a WHAT in the Freebox?

---

## RYAN:
And the Morrisons pay 50% not 25.

---

## JULIE:
Honey, what are you talking about?

---

## RYAN:
What the actual—?

---

## JULIE:
What?

---

## RYAN:
Oh my god…

---

I think…Logan may be stealing from us.

---

From the school.

---

## JULIE:
Wait, what? How would he even?

---

## RYAN:
By underreporting tuition revenue and pocketing the difference.

---

See, if someone is paying 100 percent he bumped them down to 75, someone paying 75 he’s saying they only paid 50.

---

Not every family, just like every third row.

---

## JULIE:
No.

---

He wouldn’t do that—maybe he just scrambled the columns?

---

## RYAN:
Honey, this is a thirty, forty grand discrepancy.

---

## JULIE:
So he’s been in here syphoning off cash?! While, I’m going out-of-pocket on teacher payroll.

---

## RYAN:
You are?

---

## JULIE:
We were behind on our rent to the church.

---

Which you’d know if you hadn’t quit the board.

---

I was counting on tonight.

---

The auction makes 20% of our budget.
And he said I was fake.

---

He said I was a phony.

---

## RYAN:
I should’ve never trusted him.

---

Especially cause right before lockdown Andrew was on the verge of firing Logan.

---

## JULIE:
For what?

---

## RYAN:
Taking kickbacks.

---

## JULIE:
And you put him in charge of our bank account?

---

## RYAN:
It felt different.

---

Anyway, he was spared when the shutdown layoffs happened.

---

He never found out he was caught.

---

## JULIE:
The video’s ending.

---

I can’t be on camera.

---

## RYAN:
Yes, we all noticed.

---

## JULIE:
And Ryan, we can’t take their money.

---

## RYAN:
Way ahead of you.
Good evening fellow parents.

---

I’m Ryan, father of Ryder, Jaiden and Violet.

---

And seeing our children at play serves as a powerful reminder of just how important this school has been to my family over these past six years.

---


Normally this is when I’d ask you to write us a check—but after what we’ve collectively been through this year, 

---

it feels more appropriate to make this evening about honoring the full breadth of your contributions.

---

All the snacks you’ve brought, all the flowers you’ve arranged, all the stories you’ve read.

---

The swings you’ve pushed, the toys you’ve cleaned—shout out to all my toy cleaners—well, most of you.
We, umm.

---

You mean a lot to us.

---

And, sometimes it may not feel like it, but what you’re doing here folks.

---

It’s pretty extraordinary.

---

And if I had a dollar for every friendship forged at TLC I’d send you all to Grand Geneva.

---

Instead, I’ll wish you a relaxing evening, and a restful, uninterrupted, night’s sleep.

---

## JULIE:
You’re the best partner I never deserved.

---

I’m sorry I put the school ahead of your happiness.

---

I didn’t want to believe you were done.

---

## RYAN:
Done with the school.

---

Not done with you.

---

Who helped eradicate the bedbugs you got from that “romantic” antique headboard? That was like twenty-five loads of laundry.

---

## JULIE:
Twenty-seven.

---

## RYAN:
Who drove you at rush hour to the South Wabash impound lot after you brazenly parked at the Container Store only to be busted crossing the street to Nordstrom Rack?

---

## JULIE:
I had one tiny item to return.

---

## RYAN:
And who, just this past Monday, swooped in with emergency Lunchables for the twins, 

---

going so far is to deconstruct the contents into their stainless steel PlanetBoxes so no one need know your highly processed shame? 

---

You’ve been so pissed at me for quitting TLC, but I never for one second stopped being your friend.

---

Neither has Andrew by the way.

---

He sent me to rescue you.

---

I was gonna pour a second Manhattan and let you ride it out.

---

## JULIE:
He was counting on me to ignore it and he was right.

---

I ignored.

---

## RYAN:
We could press charges.

---

## JULIE: 
And ruin a little girl’s life? Liesel’s my goddaughter.

---

## RYAN:
We could sue.

---

## JULIE: 
Bad press and lawyer bills.

---

Every parent in the city gossiping about us.

---

Not him, us.

---

## RYAN:
On the bright side, we wouldn’t be entrusted to so much as guard the juice boxes at any school-sponsored event for the next eighteen years.

---

## JULIE:
Honey, don’t drink that; it’s bubble bath.

---

[door slams]

---

## NICOLE:
Julie? Hello? Are you in here?

---

## JULIE:
Are you kidding me right now?

---

## NICOLE: 
Am I too late? I have the auction stuff.

---

Oh Julie, you do look like a princess.

---

Except.

---

A very sad princess.

---

You won’t believe what I went through to get here.

---

I had to snowshoe my way to the gas station.

---

Hitched a ride to the train.

---

I rode into Union Station, transferred to the Metra, and ran the rest of the way.

---

## JULIE:
Where were you? Why didn’t you call?

---

## NICOLE:
My phone was dead.

---

Then the power went out, and I dropped it in the snow.

---

## JULIE:
What power? What snow? It rained here all night.

---

The snow is all melted.

---

## NICOLE:
Have you both been crying?

---

## RYAN:
We just found out Logan’s been….

---

He’s been…

---

## NICOLE:
Did you tell her?

---

## RYAN:
No.

---

Cause I keep my promises.

---

## JULIE:
Wait—so this whole time—

---

## RYAN:
He’s been embezzling tens of thousands dollars from The Learning Co-Op, LLC.

---

## NICOLE:
No.

---

That’s not.

---

Not Logan.

---

He wouldn’t.

---

## JULIE:
When you went to “the woods” for the weekend—when you bailed on the skating party—when you said you were “taking a drive.”

---

## NICOLE:
Trust me, I wanted to tell you, but I knew you wouldn’t approve.

---

## JULIE:
So you thought it’d be better to lie? How do I know you’re not a conspirator?

---

## NICOLE:
Because I ended it.

---

I chose the school.

---

I chose you.

---

## JULIE:
Well, thanks to him there is no more school.

---

## NICOLE:
Fuck that fucking guy.

---

He built toddler beds for my kids.

---

He put gas in my car.

---

And you’re saying that was with….

---

stolen money?

---

## RYAN:
Maybe stop centering yourself.

---

It’s really unseemly.

---

## JULIE:
Is this what you meant about being “here for the wrong reasons?” 

---

## NICOLE:
Julie, if you could please just consider my situation—

---

## JULIE:
Nicole, I considered your situation the moment we met.

---

At the meet and greet.

---

On the lawn with the cookies.

---

Our boys with their little masks.

---

You broke down.

---

I asked: were you okay? And you said: yeah these are tears of relief.

---


And I told Ryan: see, this is why TLC has to reopen.

---

Parents need us.

---

The schools are staggering along, the daycares that survived cut enrollment.”

---

Six years ago I founded this school at the expense of my own professional advancement, and private priorities, 

---

because I identified a need.
And still people make the cruelest assumptions.

---

They judge me for donating time to the very community they benefit from.

---

They judge me for enforcing health and safety standards I’m legally obligated to uphold.

---

But the worst part? Most of the moms here treat me like—like—like I’m their fucking mother.

---

A nagging, bossy mother! Because in trying to support them, 

---

I embody everything they hate about themselves.
But with you it’s worse.

---

Cause I thought we were actually friends.

---

## RYAN:
I’d ask you to lock up, but what would be the point.



---

## LOGAN:
You here for the Outback?

---

## RYAN:
I trust it’s all thawed.

---

## LOGAN:
Yeah… And the battery’s new.

---

I put air in the tires.

---

Can you please tell her—

---

## RYAN:
Nope.

---

But I bet you can guess what she said about you.

---

## LOGAN:
I’m glad you came.

---

I’ve been missing our friendship.

---

A lot.

---

I hate it got so.

---

Transactional.

---

So when you texted—

---

## RYAN:
Yeah.

---

This isn’t a friendly visit.

---

We just had to confirm you’d be home.

---

## JULIE:
How could you do this to us?

---

## LOGAN:
Wow.

---

Honestly? I didn’t expect you to notice.

---

And what this divorce is costing.

---

## JULIE:
Katie’s been supporting you, while you were stealing from us to play house with Nicole.

---

Preening like you invented fatherhood.

---

You’re not exceptional.

---

You’re an average millennial dad.

---

Whose entire lifestyle, by the way, is enabled by the women around you: the aunt who gave you this property, the wife working nights to spend days with her daughter.

---

## LOGAN:
First of all.

---

If you add up all those hours I put in for <br>nothing—

---

## RYAN:
You think we gave you nothing? Our work is not nothing.

---

Our community’s not nothing.

---

How dare you reduce us to nothing?

---

## LOGAN:
Whatcha gonna do? Scold me? You’d never let this go public, you’re too obsessed with reputation.

---

## JULIE:
Fortunately I won’t have to.

---

## RYAN:
Andrew has evidence you took kickbacks at the hotel.

---

Confrontation just gives him heartburn.

---

But you know doesn’t hate confrontation? The lawyers for the hotel group.

---

## JULIE:
One of whom happens to be Cindy Kim, TLC’s most generous donor.

---

## RYAN:
Does she like being robbed? Should we ask her?  

---

## LOGAN:
Are you gonna tell Katie?
My daughter needs me.

---

I can’t lose her.

---

## JULIE:
You could.

---

But maybe you won’t.

---

## LOGAN:
I don’t have your money.

---

## RYAN: 
Yes, you do.

---

I can see it through those giant picture windows.

---

## JULIE:
It’s like a lumberjack moved into West Elm.

---

## RYAN:
Ochre and teak with an accent of plaid.

---

## JULIE:
That walnut sideboard.

---

## LOGAN:
Which I refinished.

---

By hand.

---

You have to understand.

---

My Aunt was a Level 4 hoarder.

---

This place was a trash heap.

---

I spent two years sanding floors and swapping favors.

---

To build a home where my child could thrive.

---

## RYAN:
Ah, so you’re saying: inspired by love for your kid, you took an empty space and some yard sale furniture, and, 

---

through countless hours of unpaid labor, your own and your neighbors’, transformed it into a haven for growth and learning?

---

## JULIE: 
Katie engaged a listing agent.

---

The contract should be hitting your inbox right about now.

---

[new mail chime on phone]

---

We strongly suggest you comply.

---

## RYAN:
You used our blocks to build your tower.

---

We knock down your tower and take back our blocks.

---

Know what that’s called? Natural consequences.

---

## RYAN:
The babies on the bus cry wha, wha, wha….

---

all through the town.

---

Ooh, vented.



---

## NICOLE:
Thanks for retrieving my vehicle.

---

## RYAN:
Yup.

---

## NICOLE: 
I brought you a latte.

---

## RYAN:
I exclusively drink dark roast.

---

## NICOLE:
My mistake.

---

## RYAN:
I’ll add it to the tally.

---

## NICOLE: 
How is she?

---

## RYAN:
Not great.

---

## NICOLE:
She left me on unread.

---

## RYAN:
Is there something ambiguous about that?

---

## NICOLE:
Untagged me in all of our photos.

---

## RYAN:
Such careful attention to detail.

---

## NICOLE:
Hey, I’m not expecting forgiveness.

---

## RYAN:
Good, you’re being realistic.

---

## NICOLE:
I’d just like a chance to atone.

---

## RYAN:
So you’d like her to soothe you? With her emotional labor? 

---

## NICOLE: 
It’s not like that.

---

## RYAN:
Okay.

---

## NICOLE:
It’s not though.

---

## RYAN:
Whatever you say.
Kids! It was five minutes ten minutes ago.

---


It’s 50 degrees and my child’s running around barefoot.
Ryder, honey? What happened to <br>your—? 

---

## NICOLE:
Boots? 

---

## RYAN:
And yet I continue revealing my secrets.

---

## NICOLE:
While I suffer for withholding mine.

---

## RYAN:
So be honest.

---

## NICOLE:
Okay.

---

Well, for starters, I’ve been a bad friend.

---

## RYAN:
And?

---

## NICOLE:
Julie was there for me at a tremendously difficult time.

---

Not just for me, it was a difficult time for both of us.

---

But I wasn’t sure if it was real or if it was just—

---

## RYAN:
Transactional.

---

## NICOLE:
But I miss her more than I even miss—well.

---

Anyone.

---

All I ask is a chance to reciprocate.

---


And I get why you wouldn’t want to trust me  I’m wondering too…after all this…how can we ever trust people again? 

---

## RYAN:
We can’t.

---

But must.

---

Cause without trust, we can’t have community.

---

## NICOLE:
So you’ll help me?

---

## RYAN:
Walk me to my truck.



---

## JULIE:
Bitch, go away.

---

## NICOLE:
You’re trashing the train table!

---

## JULIE:
What’s it to you?

---

## NICOLE:
It’s sentimental.

---

It’s where our sons became—
Eli misses Jacob a lot.

---

He keeps asking about his best friend.

---

What can I possibly tell him?

---

## JULIE:
Maybe tell him: Schoolmates pass in and out of our lives.

---

But whether a friendship lasts a school year or a lifetime, there is still value in it.

---


Even if our sons never see each other again their friendship was real.

---

It just sucks they have to pay for our mistakes.

---

## NICOLE:
Maybe they don’t.

---

Maybe we don’t either.
At every turn you offered support, understanding and kindness.

---

But I was too busy trying to escape.

---

## JULIE: 
We can’t go over it.

---

We can’t go under it.

---

We have to go though it.

---

## NICOLE:
But not alone.

---

## JULIE:
I thought I could save all the mothers.

---

I thought if we banded together and gave a big middle finger to the system we could make that mythical village.

---

The truth is: our world runs on maternal sacrifice.

---

We’re the hidden fuel of the global economy.

---

And all the store-brand Triscuits in the world can’t fix that shit.

---

## NICOLE:
Yeah.

---

You might need a new strategy.

---

Soda crackers? Cheez-its? Run for office, maybe? Hey, how hard could it be?
I got you something.

---

## JULIE:
I hope it comes with a joint.

---

Or at least a scented candle.

---

## NICOLE:
How ‘bout an eye-popping stash of chrysanthemums, comets, and dragon eggs?

---

## JULIE:
Do I look like a seventeen year-old in a fuchsia Wet Seal minidress sweet-talking the bouncer at Limelight?  

---

## NICOLE:
No, but that story sounds awesome.

---

## JULIE:
Holy shit.

---

These are fireworks.

---

## NICOLE:
Yup.

---

And I know how to get on the roof.
