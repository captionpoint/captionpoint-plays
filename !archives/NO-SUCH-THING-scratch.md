(In the darkness, a distinctive knock: two soft raps, one louder, two more quick ones. The sound reverberates for a moment or two, then fades as lights rise on Fallon and Ren lying side by side on a hotel bed. They are relaxed, fully clothed but rumpled, semi-buttoned, and barefoot.)

---

## REN:
My turn … ahh. Here we go… During my first year of college, really my first semester, I had this roommate who became a very close friend—

---

## FALLON:
What was her name?

---

## REN:
(Smiling) What would you like it to be?

---

## FALLON:
Mmm. Lizette?

---

## REN:
Oh, I love that! So. Lizette had this thing about foreign men. She was always drawn to guys from Yemen, India, Argentina, Zimbabwe—

---

## FALLON:
Brown guys.

---

## REN:
Not necessarily. Just guys from … well … anywhere but here, really. I don’t mean she was slutty—she really wasn’t. In fact, at that point, she was even a little prudish. But she wanted to get to know these guys, see. Possible worlds, you know … that intimacy of seeing inside another person? The who and why of them. And there was this one Chinese student—Chen Sheng. He was studying to be a shrink, and he was, well, just very guarded. Seriously circumspect, a little walled in, super intellectual, not at all chatty. But Lizette had never been anywhere in Asia and she wanted to know all about him … his culture, his homeland … his family. And she broke him down little by little throughout that first semester, and they kind of got to be—in her words—pals. Buddies, ya know. So one night, she asked him to come with her babysit at some friends’ apartment, and lo, he said he would.

---

## FALLON:
Lo? I thought his name was Sheng.


---

## REN:
This is me ignoring you. So that night he shows up at her door with a dozen longstemmed roses in this enormous box. Which Lizette found a little over the top but very sweet and probably cultural. Anyway. Later that evening … the friends had gone out, the baby was asleep, and Sheng had finally started to really open up and tell Lizette all about his life in Hong Kong, his family, the girl he’d left behind, his hopes to one day return. And Lizette, always a very good listener, was getting exactly what she came for. But at a certain point, Sheng stops talking and gazes at her with this real intensity … and in the next second, he came across that couch like he’d been shot out of a cannon, ground himself down on top of her and started ripping at her clothes. So he’s got her totally pinned down, right? He was a small guy, but he was wiry and very strong. Lizette finally managed to shove him back a little, and she kind of grabs him by his face like this, and screams, “Get off me, Sheng! You’re crazy! You’re crazy! You’re crazy!”

(Fallon laughs. Ren, unsmiling, watches his reaction carefully.)

---

## FALLON:
So. East met West, head-on.

---

## REN:
But that’s not the end of the story. So. Sheng gets off her in a hurry and moves to the far end of the couch, staring straight ahead. And then he throws up over the side. Lizette just sits there like this. Finally, Sheng gets up, goes to the kitchen, comes back with a giant wad of paper towels, swabs up the vomit. Then he goes into the bathroom and he stays in there for like forty minutes doing god knows what. And then. When he finally comes out, he just sits back down, never even looks at her, and never says another word the entire evening. Hours, mind you. Later, he walked her home—still in total silence. And he never spoke to her again. I mean never, not even when she addressed him directly.

---

## FALLON:
Well, of course not. He’d lost face not once but twice. First you forced him into deep personal confessions—

---

## REN:
I did?

---

## FALLON:
Lizette did. She coaxed him in very close and once he got there, she claimed he’d totally misread her signals, and she refused him.

---

## REN:
But what should she have done differently?

---

## FALLON:
She was a flirt.

---

## REN:
Well. Given that.

---

## FALLON:
But don’t you see, that was everything. He was a young man. She was a young and very attractive woman.

---

## REN:
How do you know that?

---

## FALLON:
It must be that you painted such an exquisitely detailed portrait of her. … I have to go.

---

## REN:
Where are you off to this afternoon?

---

## FALLON:
Tiger feeding at two. They’ll be ravenous. You might not see me again.

---

## REN:
But I’ll keep you in my thoughts.

---

## FALLON:
And you? Where are you bound next, you fetching wench?

---

## REN:
Actually, I’m leading a team of urban climbers up the north face of the Empire State Building.

---

## FALLON:
Some people were born to rappel. Will you shower first?

---

## REN:
No, you go. My climb’s not till four.

---

## FALLON:
Whereas my tigers . . .

---

## REN:
And the longer you keep them waiting . . .

(Fallon grins at her fondly, picks up his shoes, and exits. Ren watches him go, and then stretches luxuriantly. Lights crossfade to Ted, sitting in his and Ren’s living room reading on a tablet. Ren hovers on the bed in the hotel for a few moments, putting herself together, as Ted begins speaking.)


---

## TED:
(Calling off)
Ren?

---

## REN:
(from the hotel room)

What?

---

## TED:
Did you remember to pick up my shirts today?

---

## REN:
Yes.

---

## TED:
How were they?

---

## REN:
Your shirts? They were fine. They were white. They were crisp. Same as always. (She crosses into the living room.)

You do know Olivia’s coming, don’t you?

---

## TED:
Oh. Was that tonight?

---

## REN:
Any minute. She’ll object to that tie, ya know. How does she look to you these days?

---

## TED:
She looks good.

(Beat; he notes Ren’s worried look) She doesn’t look good?

---

## REN:
You don’t notice things.

---

## TED:
I don’t, do I? You think she’s not doing well?

---

## REN:
I don’t know, something’s up. She’s gotten so pensive again lately, and she’s always heaving these great gusty sighs.

---

## TED:
Well, maybe she’s just . . ruminating. Woolgathering. We all do that, you know. I do a lot of that.

---

## REN:
I know you do, honey.

---

## TED:
Don’t let her see you worry.

---

## REN:
Oh, I know.

---

## TED:
I’ll pay attention tonight. I’ll make a point of it.

---

## REN:
Would you, sweetie? (Kissing him on the forehead) Thank you.

---

## TED:
Mmm. You smell good. What is that?

---

## REN:
Shampoo? How’s your drink?

---

## TED:
Very fortifying.

---

## REN:
Excellent. Let me run check my sauce. (She exits. Then, from off) Anything new at work?

---

## TED:
Nothing that wouldn’t bore you to stupefaction. How’s the script coming?

---

## REN:
(Off)

I finished it!

---

## TED:
That’s great. Congratulations.

---

## REN:
I’ve submitted it to Marilyn, so we shall see.

---

## TED:
What’s the title?


---

## REN:
I’m not going to tell you again.

---

## TED:
Sorry. Do I know that?

---

## REN:
It’s Tete-a-tete.

---

## TED:
Sounds juicy.

---

## REN:
Here’s hopin’.

(Ted returns to his tablet. After a moment Olivia enters.)

---

## OLIVIA:
Hey, Daddy. Ya guys left the door unlocked again.

---

## TED:
Aww, hiya, kid, how’s by you?

(Ted rises, goes to hug her. She’s caught unawares and hugs back somewhat clumsily.)

---

## OLIVIA:
Ohhhhh, OK. We’re hugging. Good. This is a good thing.

---

## TED:
Oh, come on, what’s wrong with a little hugging?

---

## OLIVIA:
I just saw you two days ago. Is Mom worried about me or something?

---

## TED:
Not at all. Why do you say that?

---

## OLIVIA:
You are such a terrible liar, Dad. I love that about you. Every time I see Mom she hugs me. Coming and going. And I mean it’s clinical, like getting your blood pressure checked or something. Hug, hug … hmmm. And then she does this—arrgh!— this clucking thing. She doesn’t even know she’s doing it. Tsk, tsk, tsk. And it just drives me nuts! (deep breath) OK, I’m done now. … So. What’s new at the office, Dad?


---

## TED:
Ohh, you know . . .

---

## OLIVIA:
(Laughing) Dad, come on, that was so totally rhetorical. Why are you wearing that tie?

(Ren enters, goes to Olivia and hugs her, clucking.)

---

## REN:
Hi! …Oh, Ollie, look at you. Are you losing weight again? You’re very thin and you look a little pasty. Doesn’t she, Ted? Don’t you eat, honey?

---

## OLIVIA:
Come on, Ma, of course I eat. You worry too much. Anyway, look who’s talking. You’re a total bone.

---

## REN:
How would you like a nice little piece of cheese?

---

## OLIVIA:
Cheese. No. Aren’t we having dinner in a minute?

---

## REN:
We are. But I’d be happy to bring you a little piece of cheese to nibble on while we wait. OLIVIA Um. Nah.

---

## REN:
You sure?

---

## OLIVIA:
Yep, and I’m changing the subject now because . . . I’ve met someone.

---

## REN:
… A man?

---

## OLIVIA:
Yes, a man.

---

## REN:
Well, honey, that’s great. What’s he like?

---

## OLIVIA:
He’s—


---

## REN:
Are you blushing?

---

## OLIVIA:
Oh, God. Am I? haven’t blushed since seventh grade.

I

---

## REN:
Look at Ollie, Ted. She’s all pink! Oh honey, remember that stringy old bat who kept yanking you out of gym class when you were at Hewitt? What was her name? She could not fathom anyone’s cheeks getting as red as yours did. She kept telling me I needed to take you in for a TB test—!

(Noting Olivia’s exasperation) So what’s he like? Where’d you meet him?

---

## TED:
What’s he do?

---

## OLIVIA:
Well. OK. He’s—. I met him at school.

---

## REN:
Is he getting his master’s too?

---

## OLIVIA:
He’s got a Ph.D. Two, as a matter of fact.

---

## TED:
Two terminal degrees?

---

## REN:
You’re dating your professor?

---

## OLIVIA:
Did say we were dating? Did say he was a professor?

I

I

---

## REN:
OK …?

---

## OLIVIA:
He is a professor actually. I mean, not one of mine but … You guys, I really didn’t mean to make a big deal out of this. I know the idea of my finding a relevant partner has always been alarming as hell to you, but I was just planning to drop it lightly into the conversational soup. Because I really … like him.

---

## REN:
Well, sweetheart, think that’s marvelous. Congratulations.

I


---

## OLIVIA:
Mom, it’s not a congratulations moment. It’s just sort of nice. To be interested again, I mean.

---

## REN:
Well, then. I’m glad it’s nice.

---

## OLIVIA:
What do you think, Dad?

---

## TED:
I’m still trying to figure out a what a guy needs with two Ph.Ds. I mean, he’s educated, I think I’ve got that.

---

## OLIVIA:
Oh god, Dad, you are so adorable.

(Olivia and Ren exchange a tiny conspiratorial smile. The lights crossfade as Ren crosses to meet Marilyn at a cafe. They hug briefly, then Ren sits down and stares at Marilyn.)

---

## MARILYN:
Jesus. What?

---

## REN:
Did you read it?

---

## MARILYN:
Did read—? Oh ... Tete-a-tete. No, not yet. Is it funny? Tell me it’s funny.

I

---

## REN:
It’s funny.

---

## MARILYN:
Because, eesh, that last one—

---

## REN:
Was a slog. I know.

---

## MARILYN:
The lightest thing in it was the daughter’s cancer.

---

## REN:
She didn’t die.


---

## MARILYN:
She was gonna.

---

## REN:
So? Life isn’t always a romp.

---

## MARILYN:
Right, but for those characters it was just one long trudge. It was like they were whitewater rafting down a river of turds.

---

## REN:
Alright, alright. Just read the new script, OK? Are you eating?

---

## MARILYN:
I’m having a smoothie. I’ve told you about this diet?

---

## REN:
The all-smoothie-and-coffee diet. Yes.

---

## MARILYN:
I’ve lost nine pounds.

---

## REN:
Ya look great.

---

## MARILYN:
How’s Ted? How’s Princess Olivia?

---

## REN:
She’s met a man. Apparently she’s smitten.

---

## MARILYN:
Oh, that’s excellent!

---

## REN:
Not really. If you recall, smitten’s not a great look for her.

---

## MARILYN:
Are you referring to the felon she hung out with back in high school? Jesus, mamaisn’t it about time you move on?

---

## REN:
I know, I know. But every time she gets onto a new thing and she gets that funny little electric buzz in her voice—God, I remember that so well from the bad old days—it really haunts me, and then I just go all silvery. You know that feeling? Like your body is suddenly coated in silver?


---

## MARILYN:
I do. It’s called fear. Get over it, and move on. It was a long time ago. One day soon it’ll have been a decade, Ren. Which will directly correspond to the last time you handed me a script I could actually sell, and I want you to think about that. And don’t give me that look. I’m no shrink but I’ll tell you one thing I’ve learned. Sometimes in life you just have to pretend you’re over it. And when ya pretend long enough, ya wake up one day and find you actually are. And ya know what helps ya get there? Working.

---

## REN:
…It really is a comedy.

---

## MARILYN:
I can’t wait.

(Elsewhere Fallon pops the cork on a bottle of champagne. Ren gazes over at him for a moment and then crosses away from Marilyn to join him in the hotel room. He moves to her and hands her the bottle.)

---

## REN:
Oooh! Glasses?

---

## FALLON:
Glasses are for the civilized. Chug it.

(Ren does.)

I ran across a tidbit I thought we might have a little fun with.

---

## REN:
Huzzah. It’s been a while since you brought anything new to the table.

---

## FALLON:
The largest organ of the body. Bet you can’t guess.

---

## REN:
Oooh, I like a challenge. … The liver.

---

## FALLON:
Nay, m’lady.

---

## REN:
Spleen.

---

## FALLON:
Huh-uh…

---

## REN:
Brain?


---

## FALLON:
God, no. You’re way off. You’ll never get it.

---

## REN:
Wanna bet?

---

## FALLON:
I’ll give you a hint. The first letter is E.

---

## REN:
Are ya sure? Because was going to guess the bones.

I

---

## FALLON:
(Topping her off) But, oh, how wrong you’d be. More champagne?

---

## REN:
The epidermis. Or, more colloquially: the skin.

(Beat. Fallon sighs, lamely tops off her champagne.)

It wasn’t fair actually. I knew the answer as soon as you said it. I just played ya for a sucker, friend.

---

## FALLON:
I took a risk. I should’ve known better, although I have to admit I myself just learned it from the Sunday crossword.

(They laugh and drink. A small silence—a beat that expands into a longer beat.)

---

## FALLON:
And then a pall fell over the room …

---

## REN:
No, no. It’s not that. was just thinking . . it’s good, isn’t it? What we’ve made here?

I

.

---

## FALLON:
Ahh-ah. If you have to ask—

---

## REN:
I just . . . want it to stay good, that’s all.

---

## FALLON:
Isn’t that the point?

---

## REN:
Yes, I know. And if you reassured me too often I suppose I’d start to doubt us both. Still. I do . . . look forward to you so.


---

## FALLON:
Same. But when it’s over—if and when that happens—we’ll both know it. There won’t be any tears or terrible accusations. One day these rooms will simply be empty of us.

---

## REN:
I suppose you’re right.

---

## FALLON:
Shall I call you by today’s name?

---

## REN:
Whisper it to me.

(Fallon leans over, speaks low into her ear. Ren laughs, whispers into his ear. They kiss as, elsewhere, the lights come up on Olivia in a cafe. She’s looking around, clearly annoyed.)

---

## OLIVIA:
You’re late.

(In the hotel room, Ren checks her watch.)

---

## REN:
Oh shit, I’ve gotta go!

(She kisses Fallon lightly and hurries to join Olivia in the café.)

---

## REN:
Sorry, sorry, sorry! I lost track of time.

---

## OLIVIA:
What is happening to you? There was a time when you were never, ever late.

---

## REN:
You mean to see you? Well, I never dared. If you’ll recall, there was no telling what you might do.

---

## OLIVIA:
Well, ya got me there. … How are you, Ma?

---

## REN:
Oh, I’m … wonderful actually.

---

## OLIVIA:
Really? That’s great.


---

## REN:
How about you?

---

## OLIVIA:
Believe it or not, I’m wonderful too. This may be a first. Both of us wonderful at the same time. I ordered you a caramel latte. Twenty minutes ago, glacier standard time.

---

## REN:
Ya gonna have a wee widdle nibble of sump’n sweet?

---

## OLIVIA:
Don’t do the baby talk today, Ma, I can’t take it. Anyway, I’m off sugar.

---

## REN:
Sugar too now? Then why did you want to meet here?

---

## OLIVIA:
Because you love your sweets. So go for it. Although I think our server might have gone back to theatre school—I haven’t seen him since I sat down.

(Ren scans the area for signs of the server.)

Mom … you and Dad are happy, aren’t you?

---

## REN:
What? Why?

---

## OLIVIA:
I don’t know … I’ve been thinking about marriages that seem to kind of work, and, seriously I’m finding hardly any, but yours did come to mind. I don’t know. I guess that’s something . . . I might want . . . at some point. I would say. … So.

---

## REN:
What is? Marriage?

---

## OLIVIA:
Well, happy marriage. But I have this horrible feeling that once the initial excitement dies down, the most I’ll be left with is some vague sense of comfort. And, I mean, fuck that; it’s so not what I want out of my life.

---

## REN:
You might be surprised.

---

## OLIVIA:
Nah. I think I’m happiest when I’m feeling just on the edge of uncomfortable. That’s m’ sweet spot. So I just wondered . . . I mean you and Dad seem comfortable and I wondered . . . OK, yep, this is weird.


---

## REN:
Are you asking about our sex life?

---

## OLIVIA:
No! Well, mean . . yes. But you don’t have to say.

I

.

---

## REN:
We do OK for a couple of oldsters.

---

## OLIVIA:
Aww, Ma, you’re not old!

---

## REN:
Yeah, I was joking.

---

## OLIVIA:
Oh. … So how often?

---

## REN:
It varies. But in general, I’d say … maybe … once a week?

---

## OLIVIA:
You are shitting me!

---

## REN:
You thought more?

---

## OLIVIA:
I thought less! Way less.

---

## REN:
Oh.

---

## OLIVIA:
I mean, I don’t know why it matters. Every marriage is different and I know you and Daddy love each other.

---

## REN:
But you’re scared to death you might end up just like us one day, is that it?

---

## OLIVIA:
No! God, don’t twist my words.

---

## REN:
You’re blushing again.


---

## OLIVIA:
I guess what I’m saying is you’re the only woman I know—an older person, I meanwho really likes her partner. And I just wonder how you sustain that.

---

## REN:
Well, you should ask your father. He puts up with quite a lot from me, you know.

---

## OLIVIA:
I think you’ve got a secret.

---

## REN:
The secret is patience.

---

## OLIVIA:
No. That’s not really it, though, is it? It’s trust, right? Faith. Deciding to be with someone is just such a fantastic leap of faith. Don’t make the leap, we’re all safe but alone. Make the leap and … it’s still a total crapshoot. I’m just realizing how really small the chances are of finding the one person on the planet you’re meant to be with.

---

## REN:
You think there’s only one?

---

## OLIVIA:
Absolutely. One real one and an unlimited number of also-rans.

(Beat)

---

## REN:
I’m always flattered when you admire anything about me. Us.

---

## OLIVIA:
Oh, Ma. I admire plenty about you.

---

## REN:
Well. You didn’t always.

(Beat)

---

## OLIVIA:
I think I see our server. Play it cool, we don’t want to scare him off. What’re you having?

---

## REN:
The Chocolate Volcano. Just one glance at it straight on will kill you.

---

## OLIVIA:
Do it.


---

## REN:
We’ll share. My treat. So? What did you think of Tete-a-tete? (Beat) Did you read it?

---

## OLIVIA:
Uhm? I haven’t finished it yet.

---

## REN:
It’s been two weeks … Oh.

---

## OLIVIA:
No, no. It’s not bad! It’s just a little . . .

---

## REN:
What?

---

## OLIVIA:
Forced.

---

## REN:
Ahh.

---

## OLIVIA:
You should try a comedy.

---

## REN:
It is a comedy.

---

## OLIVIA:
Oh. Well, Ma, I didn’t mean—

---

## REN:
No, don’t apologize. I asked. But. I’ve started something new that I think might just surprise you.

(Elsewhere, lights have risen on Fallon entering a hotel room. Ren turns and watches him for a moment) It’s like nothing I’ve ever done before.

---

## OLIVIA:
Really? Mom, that’s awesome.

(In his light, Fallon takes a small bottle of lotion from his pocket and shakes it. Ren keeps her eyes on him.)

---

## REN:
Yeah. Yeah, it is. It just feels right. Ya know?


(Olivia turns and signals the unseen server, as Ren crosses out of the café and into the hotel room, kicking off her shoes. She sits down on the bed and Fallon sits on the floor below her, pours lotion into his hands, and begins to rub her feet.)

---

## REN:
Your turn.

---

## FALLON:
Is it?

---

## REN:
Quit stalling.

---

## FALLON:
Alright … Ahh. OK. I’ve got it. … Once upon a time, when I was eleven years old, my friend Malloy and I set fire to a house.

---

## REN:
A house? Really? Why?

---

## FALLON:
Because we were eleven. And it was just a dilapidated old farm house, a sort of relic, abandoned years earlier. It was hunkered down in the middle of a scrubby field where nothing grew. Malloy and I had used it as a kind of hideout for years but the steps eventually rotted and the whole place got so dangerous that we stopped going inside.

---

## REN:
So you set fire to it.

---

## FALLON:
We did. I’m not really sure at this point how that came about actually. It strikes me now that one minute Malloy and I were simply standing there with the dusk coming on, and the next minute the idea occurred to us both at the same time. I don’t remember speaking about it. Although we must’ve. In any case, we acted as a unit. We went all around the building, dropping lit matches. It was all very somber and formalritualistic in a way—deeply, deeply seductive. And thrilling when the flames began to take hold. We backed up onto a low ridge above the scene and just reveled in it. The fire grew and grew; it was spectacular. We could feel its heat from twenty yards away. The popping and the sparks. The sounds of creaking and splitting, and that sort of gush of fire that happens when there’s pressure from within. And … as we watched, a small black and white mutt pulled herself out from under the smoking porch. She had long hanging teats. And she was carrying two very young puppies in her mouth. By their scruffs, you know.

(Beat) She dropped them a safe distance from the house. Then went back under and brought out a third puppy. By then the flames had begun to lick up underneath the whole


structure. The dog turned around just as the entire porch collapsed. And then, I remember … she sat down and howled. Tipped her face up toward the sky and this sound just ripped out of her. … Malloy and I walked home without a word. And I wonder if he still thinks about that night.

---

## REN:
My God. Did that really happen?

(Fallon spreads his hands: maybe/maybe not. Beat.) So what did it mean to you? Anything?

---

## FALLON:
That … one must always take care, suppose. Because every place has a story. And every story is sacred.

I

---

## REN:
Even the dog’s.

---

## FALLON:
Of course. Especially hers.

---

## REN:
And if the dog hadn’t been there?

---

## FALLON:
But she was.

---

## REN:
Yes, I know. But if the place had been deserted—

---

## FALLON:
No place is ever completely empty, though, is it? Memories bank up in the hallways, you know. Stories collect in the corners and blow in and out through cracks in the windowpanes.

---

## REN:
It’s a poetic thought, but …

---

## FALLON:
Not buying it, eh? What about us then? The stories we tell in these rooms live on here after we leave. You don’t think so?


---

## REN:
No, don’t. think we take them with us when we go.

I

I

---

## FALLON:
But echoes stay behind. … I used to dream about the farm family who’d lived in the house Malloy and I burned down.

---

## REN:
You knew them?

---

## FALLON:
Of course not.

(Ren is disturbed, but she reaches out and takes his hand suddenly—a comforting gesture, very loving and gentle. He looks up at her. They sit that way for a moment, as the lights rise on Olivia in the living room, pacing. Ren glances over at her, then kisses Fallon and points at her watch. She picks up her shoes and steps into them, crosses into the living room.)

---

## REN:
Oh, hey, honey.

---

## OLIVIA:
Jesus, where’ve you been? I’ve been sitting here for ages.

---

## REN:
Well, it does help if you tell me you’re coming.

---

## OLIVIA:
Well, I figured you’d be bolted to your chair, working on your new thing as usual. Anyway, listen: He wants to take me on vacation with him at the midterm break.

---

## REN:
Who does? Oh! Well. Do you want to go?

---

## OLIVIA:
I do. And also, I don’t.

---

## REN:
Well, don’t spend his money or your own until you know for sure. My advice and it’s free.

---

## OLIVIA:
Thanks. I love it when you’re flip.


---

## REN:
I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to be flip. It’s only that it seems like a big step, and I don’t blame you for not knowing if you want to take it. Has it gotten that serious? OLIVIA Um … I kinda think it maybe has.

---

## REN:
Oh, sweetie. Enjoy itOLIVIA I knowREN But be careful with yourself.

---

## OLIVIA:
That’s the whole thing, right? Enjoy it!—have fun!—relax! But be careful.

---

## REN:
Just be gentle with yourself. You know what I mean.

---

## OLIVIA:
I’m honestly doing really well.

---

## REN:
I know you are.

---

## OLIVIA:
You don’t believe it, but I am.

---

## REN:
Of course I believe it. But does he know? About all your troubles back then? OLIVIA Yes.

---

## REN:
So what did you tell him?

---

## OLIVIA:
I told him the truth. And—newsflash—he wasn’t even appalled.

---

## REN:
Oh, Ollie. It isn’t a question of that.

(Ted enters with his briefcase.)


---

## TED:
Hello, women of the village.

---

## OLIVIA:
Dad, do you see me as damaged?

---

## TED:
Do I what now—?

---

## OLIVIA:
Because Mother does.

---

## REN:
Ollie, you’re not being fair. Maybe you should try listening to what I say instead of what you think I’m going to say.

---

## OLIVIA:
I was going to handle this very differently. I had it all planned out and everything.

---

## TED:
Would anyone else like a drink?

---

## OLIVIA:
Time has passed.

---

## REN:
I know that.

---

## TED:
I’m going to just go fix myself a quick one. I’ll catch up. Sorry. Excuse me. (Ted exits.)

---

## OLIVIA:
I mean, OK yes, I still have insomnia sometimes and anxiety now and then, and sure, I’m a mess overall, but not any worse than anyone else I can think of—certainly not any worse than you, Mom—and I just don’t understand why it’s still so important to you to see me as broken. I’m not. Broken.

---

## REN:
Where is this coming from, Olivia? Am treating you in some particular way without realizing it?

I

---

## OLIVIA:
You’re constantly handling me. And you know I hate being handled.

---

## REN:
Could you be a little more specific?


---

## OLIVIA:
Come on, Ma—you act like I might crack right in half if you disagree with me. Ya look at me like I’m about to explode any second, and ya worry constantly about what I’m doing, what I’m eating, who I’m spending my time with … It’s just too much—it’s all the time—and I can’t do it anymore.

---

## REN:
So far those are crimes can live with, kiddo—

I

---

## OLIVIA:
Will you let me talk.

---

## REN:
… So talk.

---

## OLIVIA:
I mean, yes, for god’s sake, I know: there was a time when all of that was appropriate. Years ago and hundreds of hours, not to mention thousands of dollars’ worth of therapy gone by. But I’m . . .

---

## REN:
… What?

---

## OLIVIA:
Fixed.

---

## REN:
You’re fixed.

---

## OLIVIA:
Yes. I’ve processed. I’m past it. It’s been absorbed. You know? I live with myself very well these days—I like me—I really do—and so now I need you guys to show just a little bit of trust in that. I feel like I can’t even breathe sometimes—

(Ted re-enters with a drink.)

---

## TED:
OK, what’d I miss?

---

## REN:
We’ve been handling her.

(to Olivia) You’re right. We have. We do.

---

## TED:
I don’t.


---

## REN:
Yes you do.

---

## OLIVIA:
But it’s mostly Mom.

---

## REN:
OK.

---

## OLIVIA:
I’m not teetering anymore, guys. I recognize the brink and I’m nowhere near it. I mean: Look at me. I’m OK, I’m doing great—can’t you see that?

---

## REN:
Yes, you’ve been doing really well, and that’s so wonderful, honey …

---

## OLIVIA:
You will never change.

---

## REN:
What did I say?

---

## OLIVIA:
There’s always an ellipsis. “And that’s so wonderful, honey.” Dot dot dot.

---

## REN:
Oh, now that is really unfair. can’t be monitoring my delivery all the time! Give me a break, Olivia. That’s so—

I

---

## OLIVIA:
What?

---

## REN:
Bossy!

---

## TED:
What do you say we all sit down a minute?

---

## OLIVIA:
I’m just asking you to consider the fact that I might not want to be treated like a disabled person for the rest of my life.

---

## REN:
Alright. Point taken.

---

## OLIVIA:
Now you’re hurt.


---

## REN:
No, no.

---

## OLIVIA:
Yes, you are. Your eyes have that wet look. God, I hate this.

---

## REN:
I don’t know what you want, Ollie. You come over here and you seem to have this expectation that I’m going to tell you no, you can’t go on a trip with your new friend—. I . . . I have never stopped you from doing the things you want to do. Have I? Please tell me.

---

## OLIVIA:
You have! Of course you have. But it was back when . . . oh, man. Let’s not dredge it all up.

(Begins to speak but stops herself. A beat while she regroups) I’m going with him. I’m doing it. I’ll be in touch when I get back.

(Olivia moves to the door, then turns.)

Please don’t worry. I love you guys, and everything will be fine. I promise.

(She exits. Beat.)

---

## TED:
She’s right, you know.

---

## REN:
Oh, shut up.

(Lights crossfade and Ren marches into Marilyn’s office with a leftover head of steam.)

---

## REN:
And then she just bolted out of there!

---

## MARILYN:
Yep, Ollie’s a bolter, no question.

---

## REN:
She comes and practically tugs my sleeve as if she needs both my permission and my blessing and then she’s incensed if I raise even one incidental question about it.

---

## MARILYN:
Look on the bright side. Maybe this guy’ll turn out to be the one. They’ll get married and live happily ever after and you can stop spending so much energy on this.

---

## REN:
Oh, right. Marriage. That’s all she needs.


---

## MARILYN:
See, there’s the real problem: you can’t conceive of anyone good enough for your little girl. By the way, your little girl, in case you’ve lost sight of this, is pushin’ thirty.

---

## REN:
She’s twenty-seven.

---

## MARILYN:
It wouldn’t be such a bad thing, though, would it? I mean, hopefully this guy’s not another meth head. Let’s say this time she’s found herself a real mensch. Someone who’ll kiss your ass and ask for your advice, bring ya flowers on your birthday, and treat Olivia like the little wonder she is.

---

## REN:
Marriage is an entirely unnatural state. can’t condone it.

I

---

## MARILYN:
Yeah right. Then how do you explain you and Ted? You’ve been married since God was a toddler. I’d say marriage is chiseled indelibly in your bedrock philosophy.

---

## REN:
It isn’t. Ted and I are a total anomaly.

---

## MARILYN:
Oh, please. You’ve been married thirty years.

---

## REN:
Thirty-two, but who’s counting?

---

## MARILYN:
Well, ya can’t stay with someone for thirty-two years and not … are you sure about that?

---

## REN:
The thirty-two years? Oh, yes.

---

## MARILYN:
How can that not play at least a small part in your bedrock philosophy?

---

## REN:
Have we established that I even have a bedrock philosophy? Here we’re throwing this term around and I’m not even sure I know what it means. I mean, really, there are certain tropes we cling to and hope are real and true. But do they actually constitute a philosophy? Aren’t they only as strong as the given situation plus all the variables?

---

## MARILYN:
Don’t get semantic on me. I’m talking about the rules we live by.


---

## REN:
I make mine up as go along and suspect everyone else does pretty much the same.

I

I

---

## MARILYN:
Well. They don’t.

---

## REN:
No, seriously. And I’ll give you an example. Suppose I were to tell you I’d killed someone. Not recently. A long time ago. Before you knew me. What would you say?

---

## MARILYN:
This right here is the definition of a moot point.

---

## REN:
What if I’d really done it though?

---

## MARILYN:
But ya didn’t. And ya never would or could.

---

## REN:
Oh no, I could have. You think because you’ve known me all these years you can just assume you know what I would do in any circumstance. But you don’t really—not at all. My point is, if you found out that I’d committed a murder you would have to either change your perception of me or of the act of murder.

(Marilyn rolls her eyes.)

All right. Another example. Say I’m having a torrid affair.

---

## MARILYN:
Zap. You’re having one. How’s that workin’ out for you?

---

## REN:
How does that fit into your bedrock philosophy theory?

---

## MARILYN:
I think you know my vibrantly checkered past a little too well for that particular morality question, babe. Besides, having an affair isn’t murder. Having an affair is so passé it’s not even a moral question.

---

## REN:
It’s always a moral question.

---

## MARILYN:
I’ll give you ethical, but flat-out refuse moral. Jesus. How’d we get on this? Are you having an affair?

I


---

## REN:
I’m trying to make a point by using a hypothetical. Imagine that I’ve been having an affair . . .

---

## MARILYN:
A torrid affair, you slut. You disgust me.

---

## REN:
And so, tell you about it. Do you feel differently about me once I’ve told you?

I

---

## MARILYN:
That depends.

---

## REN:
OK, but let’s add that the affair is completely uncomplicated.

---

## MARILYN:
Complication comes standard with the torrid extramarital affair. If you’d ever had one you’d know that.

---

## REN:
The man is several years younger than am—

I

---

## MARILYN:
Oh! Oh! Can we please make him twenty-six?

---

## REN:
He’s in his forties, I think. And don’t know his name.

I

---

## MARILYN:
Mmm. Torrid affairs are different where you’re from.

---

## REN:
It’s completely intentional. No names. Say we call each other little invented namesOr from literature and like that. Different ones each time.

---

## MARILYN:
Oh Jesus, and me here without my vomit bag.

---

## REN:
Just … listen, OK? The point is I’m not hurting my real life at all. I’m not. I’m adding something lovely and special and totally separate from everything else in my life. It’s perfect: He knows nothing about me except what I choose to tell him. I know nothing about him except what he chooses to tell me. There’s a gorgeous intimacy in sharing your whole self without shame—and I gotta tell ya, Mar’, it’s pretty friggin’ hot.


---

## MARILYN:
Fine for movies. But in real life on this planet, it could never work.

---

## REN:
How do you know?

---

## MARILYN:
(Laughing but annoyed) You know what you’re really saying? That people’s entire life history and point of view, which includes their politics, their most deeply held beliefs, their fears, and everything else about them, none of that’s really important. You’re saying that what matters—the only thing that really and truly matters—is this moment.

---

## REN:
Well? Haven’t you ever wanted to know someone without all that baggage?

---

## MARILYN:
But nobody comes without baggage! Just because you choose not to pay any attention to it doesn’t mean it’s not there. And sooner or later you’re gonna run into it anyway because all that baggage you’re choosing to ignore? It’s what makes us who we are.

---

## REN:
Well, maybe I think we should all travel light.

---

## MARILYN:
I got news for ya. Most of us travel as light as we can. But you’ve got the perfect marriage, and there’s no way you’d jeopardize that.

---

## REN:
Of course not. How would anyone know?

---

## MARILYN:
Someone might see you together.

---

## REN:
Oh, we’re very careful. We arrive and leave alone.

---

## MARILYN:
Is he married?

(Ren shrugs.) Divorced?

(Shrug) Kids?

(Shrug) A serial killer?


---

## REN:
I have no idea. (Beat)

---

## MARILYN:
My god, you know what? I’m really kinda diggin’ this! Say more. REN You still haven’t mentioned Tete-a-tete.

---

## MARILYN:
I haven’t, have I? So how’d they meet?

---

## REN:
Through a dating appMARILYN Huh. Okay. So how long have they been doing this?

---

## REN:
Does that matter?

---

## MARILYN:
No, you’re right, you’re right. How often do they see each other? REN Maybe once a month?

---

## MARILYN:
And the least often?

---

## REN:
Well, it’s … gotten a little more sporadic lately.

---

## MARILYN:
OK … Why’s that?

---

## REN:
There doesn’t have to be a reason.

---

## MARILYN:
Well, the audience needs to know.

---

## REN:
You know what I say. Let ’em wonder.


---

## MARILYN:
Yeah, you do say that. And it’s a problem. So, they’ve gotten more “sporadic” … but neither of them has a problem with that.

---

## REN:
Wouldn’t that defeat the purpose?

---

## MARILYN:
But then you’re intentionally leaving out the human factor.

---

## REN:
Which is?

---

## MARILYN:
People care? They get jealous. They doubt. They get more involved than they thought they would.

---

## REN:
You’re missing it, Mar’. They’re totally involved. Without any of that extra nonsense.

(Fallon enters a hotel room and paces. Ren turns and watches him.)

---

## MARILYN:
Ya know something? I would go to see this! So, how does it end? (Ren spreads her hands and shrugs) Write me up a treatment ASAP, OK?

(Ren nods, rises, and then blows a kiss back to Marilyn as she crosses over to the hotel room. She and Fallon embrace briefly, then Fallon pulls away and continues pacing. Ren waits.)

---

## FALLON:
I have this friend. Malone. For quite some time now, he’s been involved with what he claims is an absolutely remarkable woman named, let’s say, Serena. The two of them have grown very close. They each have full lives independent of one another. But they also love what they’ve built together. Because it’s special. And rare. The thing is, though … Malone has found someone else. Rosemary.

---

## REN:
I see.

---

## FALLON:
Malone and Serena have always claimed there’s nothing holding them together beyond the fascination they have for one another. They’ve always been free to come and go as they will. But now … things are shifting, and, frankly, Malone is very conflicted. He doesn’t want to lose Serena. She’s become such a part of his story. And he knows too that he’s become part of hers.


---

## REN:
But now he’s in love with … I’m sorry?

---

## FALLON:
Rosemary.

---

## REN:
So the question is … what? Should he tell Serena?

---

## FALLON:
No, no. He’s got to tell her.

---

## REN:
Why?

---

## FALLON:
He feels . . .

---

## REN:
Obligated?

(Fallon nods.)

But isn’t that exactly what Serena and Malone were trying to avoid?

---

## FALLON:
Well. It turns out Malone has gotten himself a bit more emotionally entangled than he’d expected to. But … he does love Rosemary.

---

## REN:
I’m sure he does. But why tell Serena? She’s told him nothing about her situation, has she?

---

## FALLON:
No.

---

## REN:
And don’t tell me he’s thinking about spilling this to Rosemary. … I think he’ll be very sorry if he does that. But going back to Serena. He doesn’t have to tell her a thing. But if he does tell her—if he already has, I mean … then … what? … Will their story be over?

(She moves to him. Takes his face in her hands, looks into his eyes and they kiss and move toward the bed, as Ted enters the living room and sits down with his tablet. Ren eventually turns away from Fallon and watches Ted for a moment, finally crossing out of the hotel into the living room and sitting down to work at her computer.)


---

## REN:
Dinner’s just a few minutes away.

---

## TED:
Great. … Hey, were you over by the Whitney today?

---

## REN:
The museum? No. Why?

---

## TED:
Shawna . . you know Shawna, my intern? Said she thought she saw you over there.

.

---

## REN:
Today?

---

## TED:
That’s what she said.

---

## REN:
Have I met Shawna?

---

## TED:
We had her over with the rest of my interns last summer. Shawna. Blonde.

---

## REN:
Cute?

---

## TED:
Very cute.

---

## REN:
Pert?

---

## TED:
Tragically pert.

---

## REN:
I don’t remember her.

---

## TED:
Well. In any case, she’s the one who saw you over by the Whitney today.

---

## REN:
I’ve just said wasn’t anywhere near the Whitney.

I


---

## TED:
(looking at her steadily for a long moment then smiling) Alright, Ren. No need to snap at me—she must’ve … just made a mistake.

(He gazes at her another moment and then returns to his tablet. Beat.)

---

## REN:
… Oh, you know what? was over there. I’d completely blanked it out.

I

---

## TED:
She was pretty sure she’d seen you.

---

## REN:
Right. I had lunch at Pastis.

---

## TED:
Ahh. Pastis. Nice. Were you with Marilyn?

---

## REN:
Hmm? Yes. What?

---

## TED:
Your lunch. Was that with Marilyn?

---

## REN:
Objection, your honor.

---

## TED:
Is that how I’m coming across?

---

## REN:
I’m teasing you.

---

## TED:
Ahh.

(A silence. Finally…)

---

## REN:
… Ted?

---

## TED:
Ren?

---

## REN:
I was just going to say. . . It’s good, isn’t it? What we’ve got here? What we’ve built? The long haul. It’s all been worth it, don’t you think?


---

## TED:
Sweetheart. You never need to worry about that. We’re still here, right?

---

## REN:
I know. I just . . .

---

## TED:
What? What is it?

---

## REN:
Oh, I don’t know. … It’s just that things feel so off-kilter to me lately. It’s nothing really. I just wish Ollie would stop being so over it with us all the time, and when I say “us,” you know I really mean me—I’m always the one who sets her off, but she just seems so far away from me these days, so incommunicado, and I just worry—

---

## TED:
She’s working things out. It’s actually good, Ren, I really think so. She’s told us what she needs, and we’re doing our best to give it to her. It’s all pretty simple if you just … let it be simple.

(A sudden knock on the door—the hotel code knock. Ren freezes. She collects herself and turns toward the door just as it bursts open and Olivia and Fallon enter. Olivia is grinning and keyed up. She carries a Mexican Day of the Dead skeleton on a stick—one of those with jointed arms and legs and a string that manipulates them, which she is jerking.)

---

## OLIVIA:
Buenas noches, parental units! I want you to meet Marcus Fallon!

(Ren is bolted to her spot when she sees Fallon. Ted rises, beaming. Lights go quickly to black. End of Act I.)


ACT II

(About three years earlier. Ren is pacing in a hotel room. There is a knock on the door—the code knock, first time ever. Ren crosses and opens the door to find Fallon standing there.)

---

## REN:
Well, hello. … I like your knock.

---

## FALLON:
Thank you. made it up. Just now. … So? May I come in?

I

(Ren laughs at herself and steps aside so that he can pass into the room. They look each other over frankly.)

---

## FALLON:
Am I what you pictured?

---

## REN:
I hadn’t pictured anything really.

---

## FALLON:
Is that true?

---

## REN:
Did you?

---

## FALLON:
Of course.

---

## REN:
And am I what you pictured?

---

## FALLON:
Truthfully? Not at all.

---

## REN:
(Chuckling but with a cringe) The truth is overrated.

---

## FALLON:
You’re not what I expected. On the other hand, that’s not a bad thing. What shall I call you? Your “guidelines” stipulated no names.

---

## REN:
I think that’s best, don’t you?


---

## FALLON:
I don’t know. I’ve never done this before. But for today I think I’ll call you … Masha.

---

## REN:
Well, I won’t call you Vershinin. Not just yet anyway.

---

## FALLON:
Ha. Nicely done. Why don’t you call me … Valmont.

---

## REN:
All right. … “Valmont,” I’m just going to say it: you’re younger than I thought you’d be.

---

## FALLON:
And you’re older than thought you’d be.

I

---

## REN:
Hey. I’m older than I thought I’d be.

(Fallon laughs. Ren crosses and sits on the bed.) So tell me.

---

## FALLON:
Tell you what?

---

## REN:
Well, everything, obviously. But not just yet. For now, tell me your best-case scenario.

---

## FALLON:
Regarding this … us, you mean?

---

## REN:
Yes. What are your rules?

---

## FALLON:
Oh, let’s not call them that.

---

## REN:
Hopes, then. Wishes? Druthers?

---

## FALLON:
Mmm. … I suppose I hoped you’d be beautiful. And right there, that’s a yes. That you’d be bright. And funny. So far, so good, but I’m taking a wait and see. … That you’d be someone who enjoys physical pleasure and intelligent conversation and knows damn well she’s after both. Someone very alive, you know? Someone both curious and fascinating. … Now you.


---

## REN:
Alright. … Everything you just said sounds perfect to me. Beyond that, there’s only one more thing I think is truly essential.

---

## FALLON:
Secrecy?

---

## REN:
(laughs) All right, two things.

---

## FALLON:
And the second?

---

## REN:
That you’d be someone with a story to tell.

---

## FALLON:
A story.

---

## REN:
Don’t you have a story?

---

## FALLON:
Oh, I have lots of stories.

---

## REN:
Well, then.

---

## FALLON:
These stories. Would they have to be true?

---

## REN:
Mmm. Let’s say they would have to represent true feeling … without apology or shame.

---

## FALLON:
Ahh. Yes, I think I see now. … And I believe I can promise all of that. And as we seem to have come to it, may I kiss you now?

(He crosses to her, sits on the bed by her side, and kisses her.)


---

## FALLON:
(Cont’d.) Well. That was very nice. May try another?

I

(He kisses her again—longer this time.)

---

## REN:
(So softly) And hope that you’d be a good kisser . . .

I

(The lights shift to Olivia’s apartment. She is sprawled on the floor eating from a carton of ice cream and looking blankly ahead. There is a deliberateness to this process—it’s clear she means to eat it all. She looks disheveled—a hot mess—and her clothes are way too big on her. Her hair, longer than it was in the first act, is all over the place. She looks as if she hasn’t slept in a week, and she probably hasn’t. The doorbell rings. Olivia hides the ice cream under a magazine She goes to the door and comes back with Ren, who seems a bit businesslike in her approach to Olivia compared to the first act—and tired. A brief silence.)

---

## REN:
Well? How are you, Ollie?

---

## OLIVIA:
Premenstrual.

---

## REN:
Oh, are you back to getting your period every month?

---

## OLIVIA:
Please tell me we’re not going to linger over my bodily processes today, Mother.

---

## REN:
All right. I guess I’m really just asking … are you OK?

---

## OLIVIA:
Considering that I’m a fat, miserable blob with zero prospects, you mean?

---

## REN:
I know you think that’s funny, but really—

I

---

## OLIVIA:
I don’t think it’s funny.

---

## REN:
How’s the new medication working?


---

## OLIVIA:
As you see me.

---

## REN:
… You should cut your hair.

---

## OLIVIA:
Why?

---

## REN:
Because you need a change. Besides that shaggy look went out when you were in high school. You’d look fabulous in a nice little bob.

---

## OLIVIA:
Listen to you. “A nice little bob.” Oh, hey, I know! I’ll make sure I look like every other loser on the planet. I’ll get a nice little bob. If I get a bob, I’ll look like you.

---

## REN:
God, you really are rotten sometimes.

---

## OLIVIA:
Well, I’m very sorry about that, Mother.

---

## REN:
Hey. Really now: Are you OK?

---

## OLIVIA:
You’ve just gotta stop asking me that.

(Ren notices the magazine and moves it aside with her foot. Turns and looks at Olivia, who sighs and looks away.)

So what? Hello. I’m a fucking adult. I can eat it all if I feel like it.

---

## REN:
Of course you can. So why do you try to hide it?

---

## OLIVIA:
Because I knew what you’d think.

---

## REN:
And would be right? Are you doing it again?

I

---

## OLIVIA:
No. Jesus, Mother, fuck off—you’re suffocating me! … Oh god, I’m sorry, I didn’t even mean that, but you’re making me insane—you push and you push and that just makes me say all these really shitty things to you.


---

## REN:
Well, I suppose you’ve got a right. I know I must come across as some kind of monster at times. But you know, sweetie, all I really want is for you to grab hold of your life with both hands.

---

## OLIVIA:
Take a big, juicy bite out of it?

---

## REN:
If you’ve absolutely gotta have a slogan. I just want you to have a future, honey—a big, wide-open life with work you love, choices you make for yourself … … Your dad and I want to give you money to go back to school.

---

## OLIVIA:
What for?

---

## REN:
Ollie. …You’ve gotta start thinking about where this is all headed and pull yourself up out of this hole before it gets too late. You’re depressed, and I really get that, but—

---

## OLIVIA:
But going back to school is your solution.

## REN:
At least you’d be trying to help yourself. Come on, Ollie, life isn’t just something to get through. And you’re not going to be young forever. If you’re not careful, you could wake up one day and find yourself in this . . . strange landscape. And you won’t even know how you got there. But by then—please just trust me on this—it will be so hard to leave.

---

## OLIVIA:
Uh-huh. So am supposed to be living the life you only dreamed of or something?

I

---

## REN:
You honestly think you can say anything you want to me, don’t you? … Oh, well. Why should you respect me—you don’t respect yourself. My god, kid, you used to be so curious. You were the most enthusiastic child—always questioning, questioning.

---

## OLIVIA:
I don’t remember.

---

## REN:
It just really just kills me that you’re so uninvested in your own journey. It’s not too late to turn things around—really it isn’t. Your dad and I can help, but we cannot do it for you.

(Beat) What would you do if you could do anything you wanted?


---

## OLIVIA:
I’d finish this ice cream without you all over my ass.

---

## REN:
I’m serious, Ollie. Think about this. In a world of possibles, what would you do?

---

## OLIVIA:
I don’t know. I’d … maybe . . . God, don’t know, Mom! … Maybe … work with people who went through what I did?

I

(Beat)

---

## REN:
Really?

---

## OLIVIA:
Oh, what? Wrong answer?

---

## REN:
No. No, it’s a great answer. Is that something you think you’d really like to do?

---

## OLIVIA:
I think … maybe … yeah, I think might.

I

---

## REN:
Then please. Take us up on our offer. Will you think about it, sweetheart? (Olivia nods slowly.)

And do you want me to put that back in the freezer?

---

## OLIVIA:
Nope. I’m going to eat it all right now. You can watch me if you want.

(Olivia picks up the ice cream and puts a huge spoonful into her face, smiling at Ren, who chuckles and shakes her head. Elsewhere, Fallon enters a hotel room. Ren turns and watches him for a moment.)

---

## FALLON:
I’ve brought you something.

(Ren crosses out of the scene with Olivia to join him.)

---

## REN:
What is it?


---

## FALLON:
I don’t know. What could it be? Go ahead—unwrap it.

---

## REN:
Oh, wow, it’s a skull. … Mmm, chocolate. Ooh, it’s good, got some cinnamon in there.

---

## FALLON:
Traditional Day of the Dead candies. I found them at a Mexican bodega by my place. Have you ever been? To Mexico, I mean.

---

## REN:
Never. I took four years of Spanish in college and then never even got around to visiting Mexico. Maybe I’ll go there with you someday—I’d love that. … Oh. I’m sorry.

---

## FALLON:
No. No worries. But you really should go. There’s a wonderful city in the south of the country called Oaxaca. … It’s the only place I’ve ever visited where I’ve actually thought I might drop everything, go down there, and just … begin again.

---

## REN:
Yeah?... Tell me.

---

## FALLON:
The first time I was there, about twenty-five years ago now, I arrived quite by accident on the Day of the Dead. I wasn’t expecting to, but I immediately fell in love with both the place and the holiday. Picture ancient Aztecan polytheism banging straight into Catholicism and coexisting all these centuries later. Extraordinary really. Entire families visit the cemetery where their kinsmen have been laid to rest. They spruce up the graves and eat and drink and tell stories of their dead—all these small epics full of laughter and yearning and, I don’t know … reverence, I suppose. Later there are fireworks and music in the town square. Children run through the streets with little jointed wooden skeletons that jump when they pull a string. There are processions and santos, candles and singing, but it’s all so celebratory. They’re not celebrating their heroes. They celebrate all their dead. Old-age dead, car-wreck dead, alcoholic livercollapse dead, the whole pantheon . . .

My mother died some years ago. Fifty-six years old. Cancer. Brutal. Ugly. Very drawn-out. In the end, it robbed her of everything. She was yellow, desiccated. A husk. When I went to see her she couldn’t speak—she’d simply clutch my arm and close her eyes. She wanted to be done with it all, you see, but I didn’t have the strength to make that happen for her. She lived months longer than the doctors had forecast—the whole time in pain that no drug could touch. At any rate. One late afternoon. I got the call. She was gone. Well. I’d been expecting it so long . . . Still, when it happens. . . . I remember I poured a couple fingers of whiskey into a teacup. I stood at the smudged window of my apartment looking out over buildings and cement. I hadn’t had even one sip of that whiskey when I was blasted by this overpowering—this unstoppable need to go


dancing. To move to fast, percussive music and rub up against sweating women, to drink and laugh and sing, to talk nonsense and stay out all night long.

---

## REN:
To live.

---

## FALLON:
Yes.

---

## REN:
And did you?

---

## FALLON:
Of course I did.

(Ren slowly smiles, nods, and leans in to kiss him. The lights crossfade to Marilyn in her office, on the phone. Ren glances over and then crosses into Marilyn’s office. Marilyn waves at Ren then holds up a finger.)

---

## MARILYN:
Tell me we’re not doing this again. . . . Because, Todd, that’s not how it works. Let me ask you this. Which is more important to you: me as your friend or me as your agent? . . . That’s what I thought. And as your agent, I’m telling you: all you have to do is wait. . . . Two days tops . . . yes. I promise. It’s a done deal, Todd. All we’re waiting for is ink. OK? . . . I’ll call you. Smooches.

(Marilyn hangs up, shaking her head at Ren.)

Writers. How are you?

---

## REN:
Who was that?

---

## MARILYN:
My hot L.A. teenager with the six-figure Penguin Random House deal, thank you very much. M. Todd Apple. He’s twenty-four. Brilliant. Bristling with attitude. Muscular prose. Pulsing intelligence.

---

## REN:
Nice ass?

---

## MARILYN:
He’s darling—can’t even raise a beard!

(She rises and twirls around) What do you think? New diet. Wheat grass and sea vegetables. Well, and smoking. I’ve lost six pounds in four days. But I’m about to switch over to that new one where you can only eat animal fat and bitter greens. A colleague of mine tried it and she looks spectacular. Absolutely cadaverous.


---

## REN:
Mar’. want to ask you a question and I’d like a brutally honest answer.

I

---

## MARILYN:
Okayyyy …?

---

## REN:
Well. It’s been a very long time since you’ve been able to do anything with my work and . . . I don’t want to put you on the spot or anything, but . . . on the other hand, you’re in this business to make money …

---

## MARILYN:
Yes? Spit it out already.

---

## REN:
If you and I hadn’t gone to grad school together . . .

---

## MARILYN:
Ohhhh. Would be representing you now.

I

---

## REN:
Yes.

---

## MARILYN:
I don’t know.

---

## REN:
… Thanks. I appreciate your candor.

---

## MARILYN:
Come on, you said brutally honest, so I’m gonna level with you. Ever since the whole Olivia mess—and don’t get me wrong, I know that was super hard for you and I’m not trying to simplify it—but since then your work has lost its edge and gone really dark. It’s bleak, Ren, and it’s depressing. Know what I’m saying?

---

## REN:
I think so. Louder, faster, funnier, dumber?

---

## MARILYN:
Exactly! Yes, for god’s sake, I’d be thrilled to get a loud, fast, funny, dumb script outa you. Maybe a comedy about four hilariously horny older broads on a road trip or something.

---

## REN:
No. God, hate that cutesy, crusty old lady crap.

I


---

## MARILYN:
Yeah, I hate it too. But it makes money. Here’s the thing: Whatever ya do next, Ren, throw some sex in there while you’re at it, OK? And let’s you and me try to make us some a that money.

(The lights pick up Ted, drink in hand, in the living room. Ren, lost in thought, crosses to the living room, where she stands looking out. Beat.)

---

## REN:
I’m thinking we should replace that painting.

---

## TED:
Why?

---

## REN:
It’s been there twenty years. I’m bored with it. Aren’t you?

---

## TED:
I never notice it.

---

## REN:
Right. My point.

---

## TED:
What would you rather have there?

---

## REN:
I don’t know. Something else.

---

## TED:
All right.

---

## REN:
We should at least notice the things we have. Don’t you think?

---

## TED:
Well. I mean. I notice them. But it’s peripheral. I know that this chair is comfortable, and therefore I’m happy when I sit in it. If I no longer look at the details of that painting, it’s only because I now appreciate it on a more . . . mundane level, I suppose you’d say. Because it’s part of the way things are here. And I like the way things are.

---

## REN:
Do you? mean, do you really? Or are you just used to it all?

I

---

## TED:
Both.

---

## REN:
Well. I guess that’s good then.


---

## TED:
But you can replace the painting if you want to. I won’t kick.

---

## REN:
No. It’s all right. Oh. I didn’t tell you. Ollie aced every single one of her classes this semester. And she’s shortlisted for a really competitive internship this summer.

---

## TED:
Well, of course she is. She’s a smart cookie.

---

## REN:
I’m so proud of that girl.

---

## TED:
Yep. Me too. Absolutely. Still. . .

---

## REN:
What?

---

## TED:
I just wish she’d shown some interest in Northwestern.

---

## REN:
She’s scared.

---

## TED:
I guess I’m hoping she’ll get beyond that one of these days.

---

## REN:
Hey. Finishing up her bachelor’s and planning to get a master’s seems like a pretty good step if you ask me.

---

## TED:
Yes. But here.

---

## REN:
What’s wrong with here?

---

## TED:
Us. We’re here.

---

## REN:
I like having my kid in the same town with me. (Beat) Sometimes I’m scared too, you know.


---

## TED:
Yes. I do know that.

(Ren looks back to the painting, as traffic sounds fade in and, elsewhere, Fallon enters and stands alone, looking off.)

---

## REN:
You’re right. It’s fine. We’ll just leave it.

(The lights dim on Ted and Ren and brighten on Fallon. After a moment Olivia enters. Her hair has been cut in a neat little bob. She looks quite put together—just as she did in Act I. She stops when she sees Fallon and stands watching him until he finally turns to her.)

---

## OLIVIA:
Are you waiting for me?

---

## FALLON:
Sorry?

---

## OLIVIA:
I noticed you in there. You were listening in such a particular way. I couldn’t stop noticing you. And then I saw you notice me. Noticing you.

---

## FALLON:
Ahh, yes. That did happen. But actually, I’m waiting for an Uber.

---

## OLIVIA:
I see.

---

## FALLON:
What did you make of the reading?

---

## OLIVIA:
Uuuuuuuum? To be honest, I found it pretty lumpy.

---

## FALLON:
Lumpy. I see. And what do you mean by that?

---

## OLIVIA:
I mean: I love his ideas. He really gets the whole thing. The way life can consume you and then spit you back out, then try to reconstitute you. But then he lapses into these kinda cutesy similes and over-the-top metaphors, and that just kinda gets in my way.

---

## FALLON:
Hah. Well. I agree. Still, he’s a better poet than I’ll ever be. And I did like the line about destiny not cornering well.


---

## OLIVIA:
I loved that! It really doesn’t corner well.

---

## FALLON:
Why did you want to hear him tonight?

---

## OLIVIA:
Well. He’s the suicide poet, you know.

---

## FALLON:
That appeals?

---

## OLIVIA:
I’m interested.

---

## FALLON:
In suicide.

---

## OLIVIA:
It’s kind of a hobby.

(Laughing at his expression) Oh god, your face! I’m joking! I read a quote from him in the Campus Herald where he said something like “The most profound thing about clinical depression is also its bestkept secret: that, for the most part, it feels utterly and completely ridiculousespecially to the sufferer.” And you know, he’s right. It is. So here I am.

---

## FALLON:
(Gazing at her intently) Have we met?

---

## OLIVIA:
Not really.

---

## FALLON:
Are you a student here?

---

## OLIVIA:
Graduate program. First year. Social work.

---

## FALLON:
Ahhhh. You imagine you can help people.

---

## OLIVIA:
Yes. … Oh. Was that sarcasm?

---

## FALLON:
… I guess it was. Undeserved. Sorry.


---

## OLIVIA:
You teach comparative lit, right?

---

## FALLON:
Guilty.

---

## OLIVIA:
I had a class at Corander last year. used to see you in the hall and on the elevator there.

I

---

## FALLON:
Yes. That explains it. Fancy a coffee?

---

## OLIVIA:
OK. But only if it’s extra fancy.

---

## FALLON:
What’s your name?

---

## OLIVIA:
Olivia.

---

## FALLON:
Olivia. How absolutely lovely. I’m Marcus. Marcus Fallon.

(He extends his hand. Olivia shakes it rather formally. Olivia heads off as lights pick up Ren in a hotel. She picks up a sketchpad and begins sketching, as Fallon, turns to her. He crosses away from Olivia while still looking back at her, and moves to take a pose near Ren. A few moments of silence.)

---

## FALLON:
How’s it coming?

---

## REN:
Ya keep moving. Stay still. … Gahhhh. Looks more like my Aunt Ila.

---

## FALLON:
(Laughing) Tell me about her.

---

## REN:
About Ila? Ohhhhh. … She was a professional dancer until she got sidelined by an injury. She was very long and thin. Beautiful. Elegant. With this amazing neck. Every summer she’d come visit my family at our lake cottage. She’d show up in a snazzy little sportscar, blow into the cottage on a cloud of White Shoulders perfume, and plant bright red kisses all over our faces. She always reminded me of some colorful, exotic


bird. She’d never been married or tied down in any way … and she … she just seemed so free. So glamorous. And so lucky. She was just very witty too, always making sly little jokes and throwing her head back to laugh and snort. We all adored her—we’d imitate her for weeks after she left. Tip your chin up a little, please.

(Fallon does.)

Anyway. One August when I was maybe sixteen, she arrived as usual for her visit. Same car, same gifts. Same wild lipstick. But … her voice had something new in it.

---

## FALLON:
And what was that?

---

## REN:
Fear, I think. And shame.

(She adds some shading to the drawing.)

She must’ve been about fifty-something by then. Still gorgeous, still dressed like a fashion model, but beginning to fade a little around the edges, you know. … And during that visit, I remember my father kept getting impatient with her. He’d cut her off right in the middle of one of her raucous, insanely complicated stories—just snapped at her like she was some ridiculous child. Told her to stop acting like an moron. Later, my brother snickered behind his hand that Aunt Ila had teeth like a horse. And I looked and sure enough, her teeth had gotten long and yellow and her gums were all pulled back.

(Ren stops drawing and rips the sheet off the pad. Holds it out to Fallon who studies it a moment.)

---

## FALLON:
Shall I tell you how it was with your aunt?

---

## REN:
(uncertain) Sure, go ahead.

---

## FALLON:
Somewhere along the way, she’d met a man. He’d seen her dance, I think, and was captivated by her beauty and grace. Her elegance. Her swanlike neck. They were instantly mad for each other. Beyond the lust, he found that he could really talk to her because … well, because she was so thoroughly independent of him—she had a real life, you know, one she’d chosen for herself and seemed to live quite happily with or without him. He found in her a light that both excited and comforted him. And in his company she was completely happy. Looking into his eyes, she saw herself reflected. And the woman she saw there was still beautiful and desirable. But every so often, he’d disappear on vacation with his family or go away on business, leaving her alone often for weeks at a time. And it was always then that her worlds—one with him, the rest without—came to seem so starkly sheared off from one another. At which point, she couldn’t help projecting herself into a snarled future of darkness, confusion, abandonment, and finally death.


---

## REN:
(Very softly) And what happened?

(Beat. Fallon spreads his hands and shrugs slightly) You scare me sometimes.

(Ren looks away, lost in thought, and gazes over to Olivia who has entered another area and sat down in a café, a small cake in front of her.)

---

## OLIVIA:
Right. I’ve only been off sugar for two years.

(Ren pulls herself together in the hotel room and crosses into the café.)

---

## REN:
Well, it’s your birthday and I forgot—

---

## OLIVIA:
No, ya didn’t. Ya wanted cake and ya thought you’d bully me into having it with you. I’ve told you so many times: I’m better when I’m off sugar. I stay more balanced.

---

## REN:
So you’re actually gonna make me eat this by myself.

---

## OLIVIA:
It’s tiny.

---

## REN:
Well. Happy birthday anyhow.

(She nibbles at cake. Then…) So? How is he?

---

## OLIVIA:
Oh, he’s fine. Better than fine, actually. Everything is wonderful.

---

## REN:
Ollie, it’s time, don’t you think? I want to meet your new … friend? Boyfriend? Partner? Can’t you bring him to dinner some night?

---

## OLIVIA:
I’m sorry, Ma. I swear I’m not trying to upset you. I just want to keep him all to myself a tiny bit longer. He’ll probably tarnish—they always do. But . . .

---

## REN:
But?


---

## OLIVIA:
I do sometimes find myself wishing could crawl right up inside his ear. Do you know what I mean?

I

---

## REN:
Oh, yes. Yes, I think so.

(Longish beat; Ren picks away at the cake. Beat.)

---

## OLIVIA:
Hey, guess what. I’m going to do my summer internship at 5 South.

---

## REN:
… You’re joking.

---

## OLIVIA:
I’m not. Why?

---

## REN:
I just … can’t imagine you’d ever want to set foot in that place again. Do you have to do it there?

---

## OLIVIA:
I want to do it there.

---

## REN:
Why?

---

## OLIVIA:
Well, they always say you should do one thing each day that scares you. I figure I’ll get about a year’s worth done on the first day. I’ll be advising the peer counselors. Pretty ironic, huh?

---

## REN:
Well. You’ll be great at it. They won’t be able to dream up anything you didn’t try. (Laughing but moved) You’re really something, kid. You just knock me out sometimes.

---

## OLIVIA:
Know what else? I’m getting off my meds.

---

## REN:
What?

---

## OLIVIA:
I quit my meds.


---

## REN:
Oh! Is that wise?

---

## OLIVIA:
I followed standard protocols and tapered off really slowly. You haven’t noticed any change and it’s been almost three months. I feel pretty great actually. Think I’m OK.

---

## REN:
Your therapist agrees?

---

## OLIVIA:
Yep. It was her idea for me to give it a shot. She’s keeping a close eye on me of course.

---

## REN:
And you’re sleeping?

---

## OLIVIA:
For the most part.

---

## REN:
Well, that is just phenomenal news, honey . . .

---

## OLIVIA:
“But be careful.” I know.

---

## REN:
My God.

---

## OLIVIA:
What?

---

## REN:
I’m just . . . so damn proud of you.

---

## OLIVIA:
Are you, Mom? Don’t take this wrong . . but do you know how long it’s been since you’ve said that to me?

.

(They are both suddenly a little choked up. Ren reaches out and touches Olivia’s cheek, and Olivia grabs her hand and holds it there. Then, embarrassed, they both pull away. Olivia picks up her fork and takes a small nibble of the cake. Ren smiles as the lights pick up Fallon’s apartment; he enters carrying a fancy tea tray. In the café, Olivia looks at her phone suddenly and rises.)


---

## OLIVIA:
I’m so sorry, but I’ve gotta go. I’m meeting Marcus, and I’m gonna be so late.

---

## REN:
Ahh. His name is Marcus.

---

## OLIVIA:
Thanks so much for the cake, Ma … it’s been a fantastic birthday. Truly.

(Olivia kisses Ren and, crossing out of the café, hurries over to meet Fallon. He has put the tray down and is pouring out tea. Olivia sits down and watches him. He hands her a cup.)

---

## OLIVIA:
You have so many rituals. The way you pour the tea . . . raise, pour, raise, lower, pause, set down. You’re so gentle with the pot. On most people that would be a habit. But on you it’s a ritual…. I think I need a couple of nice rituals. … I think about you. Off and on all day long.

---

## FALLON:
Do you really?

---

## OLIVIA:
Stop it. Why do you do that?

---

## FALLON:
What?

---

## OLIVIA:
Hide like that. And pretend you don’t know what I’m talking about.

---

## FALLON:
You think I was hiding?

---

## OLIVIA:
Keep it up. You know you were. … Do you think about me?

---

## FALLON:
I do. Nearly all the time. And think you’re only pretending not to know that.

I

---

## OLIVIA:
Maybe. But I do wonder what you think. When you think about me.

---

## FALLON:
Well. I’ll tell you what I thought the first time I ever saw you. At the suicide poet’s reading. I thought . . . what an incredibly lovely . . . astonishingly sad person.


(He turns over her wrists and looks at the scars, then traces them with his finger. Slowly, he kisses first one wrist and then the other.)

It’s . . . cellular, your sadness, and deep in your bones. … Oh, Livvie, I’m so sorry—I’ve made you self-conscious.

---

## OLIVIA:
What about you? You’re sad too, can see it.

I

---

## FALLON:
True. But I have my rituals. As you’ve pointed out. And they do seem to help. OLIVIA You see a lot of women, don’t you?

---

## FALLON:
Ritually? Or habitually?

---

## OLIVIA:
You’re doing it again.

---

## FALLON:
Yes, I heard it that time. Well, to answer the question: I’ve always liked women so much more than men.

---

## OLIVIA:
No one special woman though? Or is there?

---

## FALLON:
Ah-ah, now you’re pretending again.

---

## OLIVIA:
But am I really?

(They kiss. Then …)

---

## FALLON:
Livvie. Come to Oaxaca with me.

---

## OLIVIA:
What? Where’s Wahhh…?

---

## FALLON:
Oaxaca. It’s a magical city in Mexico, and you’ll adore it. It’s just about my favorite place on earth. And I’m going there in ten days for the Day of the Dead. Come with me. Say yes.

---

## OLIVIA:
What’s the name again?


---

## FALLON:
Wah. Hah. Kah.

---

## OLIVIA:
Again?

---

## FALLON:
Let me take you there, Livvie. We’ll call it a late birthday present.

(She leans in and kisses him as the lights shift to Marilyn in her office. Ren enters, talking very fast.)

---

## REN:
So I’ve been thinking about what you said.

---

## MARILYN:
Ren, I’ve been trying to reach you—

---

## REN:
About the rules we live by. Remember? And you were so right. We do have rules. But they’re not really ours. I mean, we think they are—they’re so ingrained we think we must have made them up. But actually we’ve been marinating in them since birth.

---

## MARILYN:
You OK?

---

## REN:
I mean, what did we know, really, when we were growing up, going to college, marrying, having kids? We knew it was what we were supposed to do. We didn’t invent the rules that made the system work—we just carried them out, mindlessly, like insects. And we go through these lives, day after regimented day, vaguely aware that something’s not quite right, but we don’t question it because, well, we have our rules after all. We’re used to them and we like them, by God. We love them, in fact, we absolutely depend on them to keep things on track—

---

## MARILYN:
Ren—

---

## REN:
But why?! See, it occurred to me today: Olivia’s off on vacation with her new whatever-the-hell-he-is. OK. So what is that really? My grown-ass daughter is out of town with some guy I’ve never met. For the first time since she was in lockup, I haven’t been in touch with her for days on end. And, my God, it’s so freeing. I was on my way here today, and I was thinking—I don’t know—I could become a flamenco dancer! … I could learn a new language. Pick up a musical instrument and join a rock band … ! I could leave Ted. Start over. I could hike the Pacific Crest Trail, for god’s sake. Travel anywhere in the world … by myself. Vienna! Budapest! Oaxaca!


---

## MARILYN:
I have a Zoom conference in three minutes.

---

## REN:
What?

---

## MARILYN:
I’m really sorry, babe, but you’re gonna have to scram. This client’s kind of a pill—he’s a big goddam baby-man if ya want the truth—but I can’t afford to alienate him, and this is the only time I could work out a meeting. So … raincheck?

---

## REN:
Oh. OK. Sure. So uhh … well. guess I’ll go.

I

---

## MARILYN:
I did try to call you. And want to hear all about it. Just. Not right now. OK, babe? … But flamenco, huh?

I

---

## REN:
(Backing out of the office, embarrassed) Definitely flamenco.

(As the lights cross, Ren moves to join Ted in the dimly lit living room. She pulls her laptop out of her bag and sits down, very pensive. Lights tighten on her as she begins to work. We hear rain start to thrum against the windowpanes. Distant traffic sounds fade in. Ren speaks softly, intently, as she writes.)

---

## REN:
“Interior. Hotel room. Dusk. … The room is quiet and full of shadow. It’s the eleventh day. The sound of rain drumming steadily against the windows. Serena sits on the bed alone. It’s clear that she’s been there, waiting, for quite a while. She checks her phone for the time. Five-thirty. Her expression says it all. He’s not coming… he’s not coming… he’s not coming.”

(The lights fade on her but she remains silhouetted in the dim light. Ted and Ren move to assume the positions they occupied during the final scene of Act I. Elsewhere, Olivia and Fallon enter a separate light.)

---

## OLIVIA:
Oh, my God, I’m a wreck. It’s ridiculous. They’ll adore you! Look at this. (She holds out a shaking hand)

---

## FALLON:
We should have called.


---

## OLIVIA:
No, no, it’s better this way. Rip off that band-aid. Wait! … OK, you do it. (Fallon moves to the door.)

No wait!

(Olivia grabs him and kisses him. Beat.)

OK. Let’s go—let’s do this. Go on, go on! Do it!

(Fallon knocks his familiar code knock. The lights come up in full in the living room. Olivia shoves the door open and pulls Fallon along behind her.)

## OLIVIA:
Buenas noches, parental units! I want to introduce you to my fiancé—Marcus Fallon. (To Fallon, laughing) Well, come on in. I know they look fierce, but they won’t actually bite you, I promise.

---

## TED:
Well, this is fantastic. Come in, Marcus, come in, and welcome. Ted Gelman. And this is my wife, Renata—Ren.

(Fallon clears his throat, pastes a smile on, and steps forward. Ren tries to get hold of her composure, but she backs away from them with her hands up in front of her.)

---

## OLIVIA:
Whoa. … Mom, what’s up?

---

## REN:
Honey, I’m really not feeling well—I think I’m going to be sick. You should go—I don’t want you to get whatever this is ... Will you do that please? Will you go now? Please.

---

## TED:
Ren.

---

## OLIVIA:
What is happening, Mom?

---

## REN:
Oh, Olivia, please, honey—you really don’t understand. Listen to me: This is … this can’t happen! I can’t do this. You’ve just gotta trust me, honey, please. Please! I can’t—

---

## TED:
Ren. That’s enough now.

(Ren turns and exits.)

---

## TED:
God dammit, Ren, come back in here!


---

## FALLON:
No. She’s right. We need to go. Come on, Livvie—

---

## TED:
I don’t know what to… I’m so sorry.

(Fallon nods, waves him away. He takes Olivia’s arm and pulls her away with him. A slamming sound, which fades to silence as Ren and Fallon cross into the hotel room and stand facing each other.)

---

## FALLON:
I wasn’t sure you’d show.

---

## REN:
On the contrary, I’ve been waiting for your message.

---

## FALLON:
I never meant for this to happen. Of course you must know that. There was no way I could have known, given our—

---

## REN:
I’m not blaming you. But right now we need to solve the problem. Can we please just do that? And then you and I will never need to meet again. It’ll be all over.

---

## FALLON:
Right. It never occurred to me that we would keep it up.

---

## REN:
And? What will you tell Olivia?

---

## FALLON:
You really think I’d tell her anything about this?

---

## REN:
But how will you break it off? You have to be very gentle with her. She’s not as strong as she might seem to you. … Why are you looking at me? You do agree it can’t go on.

---

## FALLON:
I don’t think you’re understanding me. I’m not breaking things off with Olivia.

---

## REN:
What?


---

## FALLON:
No, of course I’m not. I’m in love with her. I want to marry her. I said this can’t go on. This. What’s here between us.

---

## REN:
You are not going to marry Olivia.

---

## FALLON:
Oh, I am though. I love her.

---

## REN:
No. No. It’s impossible. Every time you open your mouth, you’ll be lying to her, covering your tracks. How can you? Is it that incredibly easy for you to lie? Don’t answer that. Of course it is. You’ll just play her the way you did me—

---

## FALLON:
You don’t believe what we had was a game.

---

## REN:
I don’t know what I believe anymore.

(A moment between them. He crosses to her. Puts his arms around her, comfortingly. She allows it, but stands stiffly within the embrace.)

---

## FALLON:
It was not a game.

---

## REN:
Then why are you doing this? You can’t. Please don’t do this. Break it off clean and walk away. She’ll be hurt. For a time! But then her life will go on. All our lives will go on. … Do you expect me to sit back and let you … ? She is my child. Listen to me. I have spent years teaching Olivia how to be honest with me, with others, with herself. But now, you’re suggesting a lifetime of lying. And I cannot let that happen. I can’t. Please—this is my family.

---

## FALLON:
I know it’s hard, but didn’t plan any of this . . .

I

---

## REN:
If you had a daughter—

---

## FALLON:
I would try to let her be happy.

---

## REN:
You would protect her!


---

## FALLON:
You’re not talking about what Olivia needs. Listen to yourself.

---

## REN:
She’s finally starting to straighten herself out and along you come. My God, there’s timing for ya. … Ya want to hear a story, “Marcus”? Well, I’ve got a good one for ya. I’m going to tell you about a young woman I know. We’ll call her Olivia. As a child she was curious. Creative. Hilarious. A real charmer—everyone said so. But she hit her teens with a primal scream, and suddenly she got loud and kinetic. Aggressive. A liar.

---

## FALLON:
Don’t do this.

---

## REN:
That went on almost three years. The day after her seventeenth birthday she was rushed to the emergency room. A collapsed lung: a complication of severe malnutrition. That’s how we found out about her eating disorders. It’s astounding, you know. The things you don’t notice when you see them every day. We almost lost her that time. But against the odds, she recovered. And soon after, she took up with an older guy whose appetite for drugs matched her own. At eighteen she aborted his baby by jumping out of a moving car. She can’t have children—has she told you that?

---

## FALLON:
That’s enough now. Stop it.

---

## REN:
The lying. The drugs. The screaming. Every day something new. Finally, they got busted for trying to sell meth to an undercover cop. The guy went to jail. Olivia was remanded to my custody. She lived in her room. She saw no one. Strangely, one day followed the next, and order of a certain kind, took hold. Idiot that I am, I started to relax. Until the day I came home and found her lying in a tub full of dark red water in our upstairs bathroom.

---

## FALLON:
I know all this—she’s told me.

---

## REN:
The steam. Her little, white face. Stricken. Gasping. Her eyes wild, as if she couldn’t imagine how this terrible thing had happened to her. … I suppose she told you we put her away. Well, it’s true. There wasn’t anything else we could do. … There’s a piece of Olivia that will always be missing. And when someone can’t be whole, you must treat that person with great care.

---

## FALLON:
Well. You would know.


---

## REN:
You are not going to marry my daughter. Do you think I can’t stop it?

---

## FALLON:
You wouldn’t do that to her.

(They stare at each other levelly for a moment. Fallon exits. Elsewhere, Ted has entered the living room and stands with his back to the audience. Ren, crossing to enter the living room, is startled to find him there.)

---

## REN:
What are you doing home?

---

## TED:
I walked out in the middle of a meeting. I didn’t realize I’d done it until I was turning onto Forty-ninth. I just up and left without a word.

---

## REN:
What is it? You look terrible. Sit down.

---

## TED:
I don’t want to sit down, Ren.

---

## REN:
All right. I’ll sit down.

---

## TED:
Have you straightened things out with Olivia? Have you explained yourself to her? And I’d really like to know too while we’re at it. What the hell is going on with you, Ren? What could have induced you to treat our daughter like that? How could you try to ruin her happiness? You have no respect. … I want you to listen to me now. Here’s what’s going to happen. We’re going to go to see Olivia. The two of us. Right now. And you are going to make this right.

---

## REN:
I see. And then what?

---

## TED:
And then we’ll invite the two of them to dinner. Just like any other sane parents might do. We’ll make something special. Lamb, maybe. You’ll charm him. You’ll sit there and talk to him until you find out everything you want to know about the man Olivia has chosen to be with.

---

## REN:
I’ll give it some thought.


---

## TED:
I’ve been paying attention, you know. You might not think so, but I have.

---

## REN:
Well, now. That sounds very dire.

---

## TED:
I’m talking now.

(Ren flinches at his tone, and he softens a bit) I know how much you love Olivia—that’s not the issue here. I know you do all this damage because you care so very deeply, because you want her life to be this incredible, joyful thing . . . but, Ren . . .

(Ted shakes his head and trails off helplessly.)

---

## REN:
Oh, go on. Say it.

---

## TED:
You can’t teach her something you’ve never known yourself. You’re afraid for her. I get that. You always have been. But that doesn’t make it right.

---

## REN:
I’ve been paying attention too. I’ve watched you fade and duck away from every major decision that ever had to be made about Olivia. You just crouched at the edge of the room and waited for it to be over. Do you think I wanted to do it all alone? I begged you to be there. But the truth is someone had to make the tough decisions.

---

## TED:
The truth is this isn’t your decision.

---

## REN:
Sure, what difference does it make to you as long as you’ve got a bottle handy? (Beat) Oh, Jesus, Ted. I’m sorry. I didn’t mean that.

---

## TED:
Yes you did. And you’re right. You’re also right that I left most of the tough calls to you. I shouldn’t have. Because for all your writhing around and trying to assign blame, and for all your poking and prodding at things, you never do get to the root of the problem.

---

## REN:
(Rising and moving to exit) I wish still smoked.

I

---

## TED:
Don’t you dare walk out of here. You’re going listen while I do the talking for a change.


---

## REN:
(Turning on him, furious) Oh what? You mean you’re actually going to share some opinion—some expression of feeling—beyond what a nice dinner I cooked up for you or how comfy it is to plop yourself in that goddam chair every night? Maybe I do poke at things. Life sometimes makes me curious, Ted. That’s something you just wouldn’t understand.

---

## TED:
See now, that’s where you’re wrong, m’love. I know all about curiosity.

(Something in his tone stops Ren, and she watches him closely.)

For a while I was curious every time I’d come home from work and find you all flushed, done up and freshly showered at the end of the day. I’d hear that shivery little upbeat in your voice. That made me curious, I remember. And that little graze of a kiss across my eyebrow. Your insistence on fixing me a drink, which you poured heavy but then again your hands were shaking just a little, weren’t they, as you twittered and drew out of me what was to you, I knew damn well, deeply stultifying commentary on my day. You could say all that made me good and curious. For a time. But you know. Gradually it came to be just another part of our life. I was less curious about it the longer it went on. That’s usually the way, isn’t it? With curiosity, I mean.

(Ren is silent.)

You are going to make things right with Olivia. Because if you don’t, I swear, you will not recognize the broken world you’ve made for yourself.

(Ted continues to gaze at her steadily. Finally, he turns and exits. Ren remains there, as the lights shift to Olivia’s apartment, where Olivia is curled up on the sofa staring at nothing. Ren rings doorbell sounds. Olivia rises immediately and goes to the door.)

---

## OLIVIA:
Marcus?

---

## REN:
No, honey … it’s your mom.

(After a moment, Olivia opens the door and walks back into the room without acknowledging Ren, who enters behind her.)

---

## REN:
Ollie, we need to talk.

---

## OLIVIA:
I think we’ve talked enough. have nothing to say to you.

I

---

## REN:
Olivia… do you know what would give to see you happy?

I


---

## OLIVIA:
No. No, god dammit! That is the wrong way to start this time. Jesus Christ, Mother, this is my life. I don’t think you get that. Really, I think you see me in the abstract. “The Hypothetical Life of My Daughter Olivia.” But believe it or not, I have a life outside your imagination. And you have been screwing that up for me ever since I can remember.

---

## REN:
I’m sorry. I don’t know how to do this. I don’t know what to say. I hate that we haven’t been able to ... I just ... I haven’t been sleeping much, and I’ve been thinking about you all the time.

(Beat) This is the longest we’ve ever gone without talking.

---

## OLIVIA:
Yup.

---

## REN:
Even when you were in 5 South.

---

## OLIVIA:
Yup. Even then.

---

## REN:
Oh, Ollie. You’re so young. When I was your age . . . there just didn’t seem to be as many choices. And the ones I made . . . well. I guess somewhere in the back of my mind I always figured that … next week, next year, five years from now, my real life would begin—and I just knew it was going to be so beautiful ... But in the meantime, you know, I had to get on with my temporary life. So I did all the things: I went to college, grad school, I married your dad, I got pregnant, and I had you. Thank God. I had you. … But somewhere along the line, your father and I, without realizing it, we turned into very friendly business partners. No. That’s not even fair. It had always been that way between us; it’s just that while you were growing up, I had so many distractions. Even those rotten years we went through, well, it was never dull, was it?

---

## OLIVIA:
Are you trying to tell me you never really loved Dad? Because that would really cap off my week.

---

## REN:
Of course I loved him. I still do. But after you moved out on your own . . . I got ... I was lonely. And I had too much time to think. I saw how things really were. I saw that this was my real life.

---

## OLIVIA:
And so? What? You cheated on Dad?


---

## REN:
Can you just let me finish? … Yes. had an affair.

I

---

## OLIVIA:
I knew it. God, poor Dad. Does he know?

---

## REN:
I don’t know.

---

## OLIVIA:
Jesus Christ.

---

## REN:
It went on for almost two years. But … it wasn’t really about the sex. Mostly, we talked. There was this incredible intimacy. I shared things about myself, about how I feel inside myself—things I’d never told anyone else. With him … I came back to myself. Because he seemed to recognize that part of me I thought I’d lost. … Can you understand? It felt like my real life had finally come—the one I’d waited for so long. It seemed … essential.

---

## OLIVIA:
Why are you telling me this? I don’t want to hear anymore. You’re disgusting. You make me sick.

---

## REN:
You need to hear it all, Olivia. I know how it sounds, but I will not apologize for it. Because it was right for us. At the time. I thought it was real, that it was the truth. And I didn’t think that could really be wrong.

---

## OLIVIA:
Mmmm. But now you’ve changed your mind.

---

## REN:
Yes.

---

## OLIVIA:
Why?

---

## REN:
Because he met you.

(There is a moment of slow dawning as Olivia continues to stare at Ren.)

---

## OLIVIA:
(Finally, in a whisper) You have to go now.


---

## REN:
I’m telling you the truth.

---

## OLIVIA:
I believe you. Now get out.

---

## REN:
You can’t marry him, Ollie. It won’t work. You have to understand: He’s just a fantasy, an illusion—that’s what I came here to tell you, honey—it’s not real, any of it!

(She catches Olivia’s hand in hers tries to pull her into an embrace. Olivia shakes her off violently and backs away.)

---

## OLIVIA:
Get your fucking hands off me! You don’t have to worry anymore—I’m safe. He was here a little while ago. He told me we couldn’t be together, that it wasn’t fair to me, that I was too attached and he knew he would only hurt me. So you see everything’s all right now! You won, Mother! You won. Now go home.

---

## REN:
Oh, sweetheart, please don’t—

---

## OLIVIA:
Go home.

---

## REN:
I’m not going without you.

---

## OLIVIA:
(Screaming) Stay away from me! Don’t you ever come back here. I don’t want to see you ever again, do you hear me? You’re fucking crazy! You’re crazy! You’re crazy!

(She keeps repeating this until Ren finally backs away and exits. A brief interlude, with music, as time passes. Sounds of a city street fade in as the lights shift to Marilyn, alone at a café table, with a sheaf of papers in front of her.)

---

## MARILYN:
How are ya, Ren?

---

## REN:
Ohhh … I’m good, but I’ve been working too much. I think I really need to take a little time away. Maybe get out of town for a while.


---

## MARILYN:
Well, wherever you end up going, I hope it’s warm. Gawd, I hate it when it starts getting cold this early, don’t you?

(They sit looking at one another for a moment or two. Finally…)

Hey. I just want to say it again. The new script is fabulous. It’s a brilliant piece of work, Ren, and I hope you know that.

---

## REN:
(With a dry smile) Ahh, but does it have edge?

---

## MARILYN:
It’s got edge straight up the ass, babe. I’m telling you it’s the breakout we’ve been looking for. A huge leap; it’s just incredible. Synergy is slobbering all over it; they want it and they’re a hundred percent ready to jump. And as it’s been such a long-ass time since they’ve allowed me to play anywhere in the vicinity of their sandbox, you shoulda heard the way I made them beg. They’re talking Julianne Moore in the lead—how about that? So! In the next day or two I should know what exactly they’re thinking in terms of future rights, but I’ve got a real good feeling. They’re excited. And I’m excited.

---

## REN:
That’s great.

---

## MARILYN:
How about you, friend? Are you excited? Come on, this is really good stuff!

---

## REN:
I’m very excited.

---

## MARILYN:
You oughta be—this one’s the real deal, Ren, the complete package, and when have you ever heard me say that? That scene in the bar where he catches the glint off her earring as she’s dancing and he flashes back to the two of them setting that old house on fire? Woof. I tell you what: I got chills just reading it!

---

## REN:
That’s great. Thanks.

(Marilyn’s cell phone begins to ring. Ren gestures for her to take the call. Marilyn instead silences the phone and drops it into her bag. Beat.)

---

## MARILYN:
I ran into Olivia the other day.

---

## REN:
Did you?


---

## MARILYN:
I did. In the produce aisle at the supermarket. I was standing there comparing two bunches of kale— ya know, as if one might suddenly speak to me. I look up and there she is, right next to me.

---

## REN:
How is she?

---

## MARILYN:
Aww, you know, she’s always kinda hated my guts; she didn’t have a whole lot to say. Frosty but polite—same as always—but … she looked great. Healthy. Told me with no prodding that she loves her work. … How long has it been since you saw her? … … … Ya know, babe, if you ever want to talk about what’s going on between you two … I don’t know that I could help, but I’m a really good ear, you know that. … … Heyyy, let’s you and me take a hop up to the Berkshires this weekend, just the two of us. What do you say? … I’m worried about you.

---

## REN:
Don’t be worried. I’m good. We’ll do it next time, I promise. You had some paperwork for me?

(Marilyn looks at her sadly, finally pushes the sheaf of documents toward her. Ren scans it as the lights shift. Transitional music as time again passes. Eventually the sound morphs into the strains of a far-off brass band, drawing Ren out of the scene with Marilyn. The sound of firecrackers popping in the distance. Ren shucks off her coat and, grabbing a rolling suitcase along the way, crosses into a hotel room in Oaxaca, Mexico. The lighting is slightly amber, reminiscent of lighting you might see on a film location at sunset.)

---

## REN:
(Speaking to an unseen person outside the door) No, gracias, señor, no necessito nada ahora. Estoy bien. Muchisimas gracias, eh?

(For a moment, Ren peers around the room, taking it all in. She crosses and sits down on the bed. The band, far away in the town square, plays on. The sound of children running by outside, laughing and jabbering in Spanish down in the street. The lights go slightly more amber. Ren sits quietly for a few moments, her hands folded in her lap. The sound of a procession approaching outside—footsteps and quiet singing in Spanish. She moves to the window where she stands looking out into the street below. The hushed, prayerlike singing grows nearer until it is right under her window. After a moment, her expression changes from one of loss and regret to one of the intrigue of a new place, a new path, a new way of life. Lights continue to fade amber around her until, finally, they fall to black. End of play.)
