---

## HENRY:
You must know that’s a futile gesture.

---

Come along.


---

## ALAIS:
No.

---

I’ll stay here and you can send reports.


---

## HENRY:
It’s going to be a jungle of a day: if I start growling now, I’ll never last.


---

## ALAIS:
You’ll last.

---

You’re like the rocks at Stonehenge; nothing knocks you down.


---

## HENRY:
In these rooms, Alais, on this Christmas, I have all the enemies I need.

---

## ALAIS:
You have more than you think.

---

## HENRY:
Are you one?

---

Has my willow turned to poison oak?


---

## ALAIS:
If I decided to be trouble, Henry, how much trouble could I be?


---

## HENRY:
Not much.

---

You don’t matter to the others; only me.


---

## ALAIS:
How great a matter am I?


---

## HENRY:
Alais, in my time I’ve known contessas, milkmaids, courtesans and novices, whores, gypsies, jades and little boys, but nowhere in God’s Western world have I found anyone to love but you.


---

## ALAIS:
And Rosamund.

---

## HENRY:
She’s dead.

---

## ALAIS:
And Eleanor.

---

## HENRY:
The new Medusa?

---

My good wife?

---

## ALAIS:
How is your queen?

---

## HENRY:
Decaying, I suppose.

---

## ALAIS:
You haven’t seen her?


---

## HENRY:
No, nor smelled nor touched nor tasted.

---

Don’t be jealous of the gorgon; she is not among the things I love.

---

How many husbands do you know who dungeon up their wives?

---

I haven’t kept the great bitch in the keep for ten years out of passionate attachment.

---

Come.

---

I’ve heard she’s aging badly; let’s go and look.


---

## ALAIS:
Would it be troublesome if I betrayed you?


---

## HENRY:
We’ve no secrets, Eleanor and I.

---

How can you possibly betray me?

---

## ALAIS:
I could give away your plans.

---

## HENRY:
You don’t know what they are.

---

## ALAIS:
I know you want to disinherit Richard.


---

## HENRY:
So does Eleanor.

---

She knows young Henry’s dead.

---

The Young King died in summer, and I haven’t named and heir.

---

She knows I want John on the throne, and I know she wants Richard.

---

We are very frank about it.


---

## ALAIS:
Henry, I can’t be your mistress if I’m married to your son.


---

## HENRY:
Why can’t you?

---

Johnny wouldn’t mind.

---

## ALAIS:
I do not like your Johnny.

---

## HENRY:
He’s a good boy.

---

## ALAIS:
He’s got pimples and he smells of compost.


---

## HENRY:
He’s just sixteen; he can’t help the pimples.

---

## ALAIS:
He could bathe.

---

## HENRY:
It isn’t such a dreadful thing to be a Queen of England.

---

Not all eyes will weep for you.


---

## ALAIS:
Will yours?

---

## HENRY:
I don’t know.

---

Very likely.

---

## ALAIS:
All I want is not to lose you.

---

Can’t you hide me?

---

Can’t I simply disappear?


---

## HENRY:
You know you can’t.

---

Your little brother Philip’s King of France now and he wants your wedding or your dowry back.

---

I only took you for your dowry.

---

You were seven.

---

Two big knees and two big eyes and that’s all.

---

How was I to know?


---

## ALAIS:
Let Philip have the dowry back.

---

It isn’t much.


---

## HENRY:
I can’t.

---

The Vexin is a little country but it’s vital to me.

---

## ALAIS:
And I’m not.


---

## HENRY:
It’s been my luck to fall in love with landed women.

---

When I married Eleanor, I thought: “You lucky man.

---

The richest woman in the world.

---

She owns the Aquitaine, the greatest province on the Continent – and beautiful as well.

---

” She was, you know.


---

## ALAIS:
And you adored her.

---

## HENRY:
Memory fails.

---

There may have been an era when I did.
Let’s have one strand askew; nothing in life has any business being perfect.


---

## ALAIS:
Henry, I was brought up to be dutiful.

---

I smile a lot, bend easily and hope for very little.

---

It is useful training and it’s made a lot of hard things possible.
But, Henry, not this thing.


---

## HENRY:
I’ve had them summoned and I’ll have you by me.

---

With the headdress or without it.


---

## ALAIS:
Oh, what difference does it make who’s king?


---

## HENRY:
What difference?

---

## ALAIS:
Have you found religion, Henry?

---

Are you going to look down from the clouds and see who’s sitting in your place?


---

## HENRY:
I’ve got to know before I die.

---

I’ve built an empire and I’ve got to know it’s going to last.

---

I’ve put together England and I’ve added to it half of France.

---

I am the greatest power in a thousand years.

---

And after me comes John.

---

If I can’t leave this state to John, I’ve lived for nothing.


---

## ALAIS:
John doesn’t care for you at all.

---

## HENRY:
We love each other deeply.

---

## ALAIS:
None of them has any love for you.


---

## HENRY:
Because we fight?

---

Tell me they all three want the crown, I’ll tell you it’s a feeble prince who doesn’t.

---

They may snap at me or plot and that makes them the kind of sons I want.

---

I’ve snapped and plotted all my life: there is no other way to be king, alive and fifty all at once.


---

## ALAIS:
I’m going to fight for you.

---

## HENRY:
Oh, fine.

---

## ALAIS:
When I was sixteen and we started this depraved relationship, I left everything to you.

---

I lap sat, drank my milk, and did what I was told.

---

Not anymore.

---

Your cherub’s twenty-three now and she’s going to fight.


---

## HENRY:
With mace and chain?

---

## ALAIS:
With anything I can think of.


---

## HENRY:
That’s exactly what I need: another mind at work.

---

Try; you can hear the thinking through the walls.

---

There’s Geoffrey, humming treachery.

---

And Richard, growling out for gore.

---

And Eleanor, she’s thinking heavy thoughts like molten lead and marble slabs.

---

My house is full of intellectual activity.


---

## ALAIS:
Add mine.

---

## HENRY:
Alais, Alais – I don’t plan to give you up.

---

I don’t plan to give up anything.

---

I’ll make alliances and bargains, threaten, beg, break heads and hearts, and by the time this fine Christmas holiday is over, I’ll make an heir of John, a petty prince of Richard and I’ll still have you.


---

## ALAIS:
When can I believe you, Henry?

---

## HENRY:
Always, even when I lie.

---

## ALAIS:
How much is it safe to hope for?

---

## HENRY:
Everything.

---

## ALAIS:
But with so many enemies –


---

## HENRY:

I know – and some of them are more canny folk than I, or more cruel or more ruthless or dishonest.

---

But not all rolled in one.

---

The priests write all the history these days and they’ll do me justice.

---

Henry, they’ll say, was a master bastard.
Come; let’s go downstairs and meet the family.

---

## JOHN:
After you.

---

## GEOFFREY:
No; after you.

---

## RICHARD:
No; after you.


---

## JOHN:
Oh, have it your way; after me.


---

## RICHARD:
You do keep growing, Johnny.

---

## JOHN:

In every way but upwards.

---

Look: holly.


I love Christmas.


---

## GEOFFREY:

Warm and rosy time.

---

The hot wine steams, the Yule log roars and we’re the fat that’s in the fire.

---

She’s here, you know.

---

## JOHN:
Who?


---

## RICHARD:
Mother.

---

## GEOFFREY:
Since this morning.

---

## RICHARD:
Have you seen her?

---

## GEOFFREY:
Haven’t you?

---

## RICHARD:
We’re not as friendly as we were.

---

## GEOFFREY:
Does she still favor you?

---

## RICHARD:
Does she or doesn’t she?

---

## JOHN:
If I’m supposed to make a fuss and kiss her hairy cheek, I won’t.


---

## RICHARD:
What you kiss, little prince, is up to you.


---

## JOHN:
I’m Father’s favorite; that’s what counts.


---

## RICHARD:
You hardly know me Johnny, so I beg you to believe my reputation: I’m a constant soldier and a sometime poet and I will be king.


---

## JOHN:
Just you remember: Father loves me best.

---

## ELEANOR:
The way you bicker it’s a wonder that he cares for any of you.
Geoffrey – but I do have handsome children.

---

John – you’re so clean and neat.

---

Henry takes good care of you.

---

And Richard.

---

Don’t look sullen, dear; it makes your eyes go small and piggy and your chin look weak.

---

Where’s Henry?


---

## RICHARD:
Upstairs with the family whore.

---

## ELEANOR:
That’s a mean and tawdry way to talk about your fiancée.

---

## JOHN:
My fiancée.

---

## ELEANOR:
Whosever fiancée.

---

I brought her up and she is dear to me and gentle.

---

Have we seen the French king yet?


---

## GEOFFREY:
Not yet.

---

## ELEANOR:
Let’s hope he’s grown up like his father – simon pure and simon simple.

---

Good, good Louis; if I’d managed sons for him instead of all those little girls, I’d still be stuck with being Queen of France and we should not have known each other.

---

Such, my angels, is the role of sex in history.

---

How’s your father?


---

## JOHN:
Do you care?


---

## ELEANOR:
More deeply, lamb, than you can possibly imagine.

---

Is my hair in place?

---

I’ve given up the looking glass; quicksilver has no sense of tact.
---

## RICHARD:
He still plans to make John king.


---

## ELEANOR:
Of course, he does.

---

My, what a greedy little trinity you are: king, king, king.

---

Two of you must learn to live with disappointment.


---

## HENRY:
Ah – but which two?

---

## ELEANOR:
Let’s deny them all and live forever.


---

## HENRY:
Dusk to dusk though all eternity.

---

How was your crossing?

---

Did the Channel part for you?


---

## ELEANOR:
It went flat when I told it to; I didn’t think to ask for more.

---

How dear of you to let me out of jail.


---

## HENRY:
It’s only for the holidays.

---

## ELEANOR:
Like school.

---

You keep me young.

---

Here’s gentle Alais.
No, no; greet me like you used to.
Fragile I am not: affection is a pressure I can bear.


---

## HENRY:
I’ve had the French King sent for.

---

We’ll state positions and I’ll make the first of many offers.

---

He’ll refuse it, naturally, I’ll make a better one and so on through the holidays until I win.

---

For the duration of this joyous ritual, you will give, to your father, your support.


---

## RICHARD:
Why will I?

---

## ELEANOR:
Out of duty, dear.


Tell me, what’s Philip like?

---

I hear he’s quite impressive for a boy of seventeen –


---

## HENRY:
My Lord.


---

## ELEANOR:
Oh – and you are.

---

I’m Eleanor, who might have been your mother.

---

All the others here you know.

---

## PHILIP:
Queen Eleanor – Your Grace.

---

## HENRY:
My Lord.

---

Welcome to Chinon.

---

## PHILIP:
Sir.


---

## HENRY:
Your grievances, as we have understood them, have to do with Princess Alais and her dowry.


---

## PHILIP:
Sixteen years ago, you made a treaty with us.

---

It is time its terms were executed.

---

## HENRY:
We are willing to discuss it.

---

## PHILIP:
Our position comes to this: that you will either hold the marriage or return the Vexin.

---

Alais marries Richard or we’ll have the country back at once.


---

## HENRY:
That’s clear, concise, and well presented.

---

My position is – Well, frankly, Philip, it’s a bit of a tangle.

---

Once I’m dead, who’s going to be king?

---

I could draw papers till my scribes drop but once I die, unless I’ve left behind me three contented sons, my lands will be split three ways in civil war.

---

You see my problem?

---

## PHILIP:
Clearly, but it’s yours, not mine.


---

## HENRY:
Two years ago, the Queen and I, for reasons passing understanding, made Richard the overlord of the Aquitaine.

---

That makes Richard very powerful.
How can I give him Alais too?

---

The man she marries has you for an ally.


---

## PHILIP:
It’s their wedding or the Vexin back.

---

Those are the terms you made with Louis.


---

## HENRY:
True, but academic, lad.

---

The Vexin’s mine.

---

## PHILIP:
By what authority?

---

## HENRY:
It’s got my troops all over it: that makes it mine.

---

Now hear me, boy.

---

You take what memories you have of me and mark them out of date.

---

I’m not your father’s friend, now; I’m his son’s opponent.

---

## PHILIP:
I’m a king.

---

I’m no man’s boy.


---

## HENRY:
A king?

---

Because you put your ass on purple cushions?

---

## PHILIP:
Sir.


---

## HENRY:
Philip, you haven’t got the feel of this at all.

---

Use all your voices: when I bellow, bellow back.

---

## PHILIP:
I’ll note that down.

---

## HENRY:
This, too.

---

We are the world in little.

---

A nation is a human thing.

---

Surely, if we’re civilized, it must be possible to put the knives away.

---

We can make peace.

---

We have it in our hands.


---

## PHILIP:
I have tutors of my own.

---

Will that be all?


---

## HENRY:
Oh, think.

---

You came here for a reason.

---

You’ve made demands of me.

---

Now don’t you want to ask me if I’ve got an offer?

---

## PHILIP:
Have you got an offer?

---

## HENRY:
Not yet – but I’ll think of one.


Oh, by the way…


You’re better at this than I thought you’d be.

---

## PHILIP:

I wasn’t sure you noticed.


---

## HENRY:
Well – what shall we hang?

---

The holly or each other?


---

## ELEANOR:
You can’t read your sons at all.

---

That isn’t anger they’re projecting; it’s anxiety.

---

## HENRY:
I read them.

---

I know Richard’s moods and Johnny’s faces and the thought behind the pitch of Geoffrey’s voice.

---

The troubles at the other end; they don’t know me.

There is a legend of a king called Lear with whom I have a lot in common.

---

Both of us have kingdoms and three children we adore and both of us are old.

---

But there it stops.

---

He cut his kingdom into bits.

---

I can’t do that.

---

I’ve built this house and it will stand.


---

## RICHARD:
Would you say, Father, that I have the makings of a king?

---

## HENRY:
A splendid king.

---

## RICHARD:
Would you expect me, Father, to be disinherited without a fight?


---

## HENRY:
Of course you’ll fight.

---

I raised you too.


---

## RICHARD:
I don’t care what you offer Philip.

---

I don’t care what plans you make.

---

I’ll have the Aquitaine and Alais and the crown.

---

I’ll have them all.


---

## JOHN:
You’re going to love my coronation.


---

## RICHARD:
I won’t give up one to get the other.

---

I won’t trade of Alais or the Aquitaine to this –


This walking pustule.

---

No, your loving son will not.


---

## JOHN:
Did you hear what he called me?

---

## ELEANOR:
Clearly, dear.

---

Now run along; it’s nearly dinnertime.


---

## JOHN:
Did I say something wrong?

---

I’m always saying something wrong.

---

All right, I’ll eat, I’ll eat.

---

## ELEANOR:
And that’s to be king.

---

## GEOFFREY:
And I’m to be his chancellor.

---

Has he told you?

---

John will rule the country while I run it.

---

That’s to say, he gets to spend the taxes that I get to raise.


---

## ELEANOR:
How nice for you.

---

## GEOFFREY:
It’s not as nice as being king.

---

## HENRY:
We’ve made you Duke of Brittany.

---

Is that too little?


---

## GEOFFREY:
No one ever thinks of crowns and mentions Geoff.

---

Why is that?

---

I make out three prizes here – a throne, a princess, and the Aquitaine.

---

Three prizes and three sons; but no one ever says, “Here, Geoff, here Geoff boy, here’s a bone for you.

---

”


---

## HENRY:
I should have thought that being chancellor was a satisfying bone.


---

## GEOFFREY:
It isn’t power that I feel deprived of; it’s the mention that I miss.

---

There’s no affection for me here.

---

You wouldn’t think I’d want that, would you?

---

## ELEANOR:
Henry, I have a confession.

---

## HENRY:
Yes?

---

## ELEANOR:
I don’t much like our children.

Only you – the child I raised but didn’t bear.

---

## ALAIS:
You never cared for me.

---

## ELEANOR:
I did and do.

---

Believe me, Henry’s bed is Henry’s province: he can people it with sheep for all I care.

---

Which on occasion he has done.


---

## HENRY:
Still that?

---

When Rosamund’s been dead for seven years?


---

## ELEANOR:
Two months and eighteen days.

---

I never liked her much.

---

## HENRY:
You count the days?

---

## ELEANOR:
I made the numbers up.

He found Miss Clifford in the mists of Wales and brought her home for closer observation.

---

Liking what he saw, he scrutinized her many years.

---

He loved her deeply and she him.

---

And yet, my dear, when Henry had choose between his lady and my lands –


---

## ALAIS:
He’ll leave me if he has to; I know that.

---

## ELEANOR:
Poor Alais.

---

## ALAIS:
There’s no sport in hurting me; it is so easy.


---

## ELEANOR:
After all the years of love, the hair I’ve brushed and braided and the tears I’ve kissed away, do you think I could bring myself to hurt you?


---

## ALAIS:
Eleanor, with both hands tied behind you.

---

## HENRY:
She is lovely, isn’t she?

---

## ELEANOR:
Yes, very.

---

## HENRY:
If I’d chosen, who could I have picked to love to gall you more?

---

## ELEANOR:
There’s no one.

Come on; let’s finish Christmasing the place.


---

## HENRY:
Time hasn’t done a thing but wrinkle you.


---

## ELEANOR:
It hasn’t even done that.

---

I have born six girls, five boys and thirty-one connubial years of you.

---

How am I possible?


---

## HENRY:
There are moments when I miss you.

---

## ELEANOR:
Many?

---

## HENRY:
Do you doubt it?

---

## ELEANOR:
That’s my wooly sheep dog.

---

So wee Johnny gets the crown?


---

## HENRY:
I’ve heard it rumored, but I don’t believe it.


---

## ELEANOR:
Losing Alais will be hard, for you do love her.


---

## HENRY:
It’s an old man’s last attachment; nothing more.

---

How hard do you find living in your tower?


---

## ELEANOR:
It was difficult in the beginning but that’s past.

---

I find I’ve seen the world enough.

---

I have my maids and menials in my courtyard, and I hold my little court.

---

It suits me now.


---

## HENRY:
I’ll never let you out.

---

You led too many civil wars against me.


---

## ELEANOR:
And I damn near won the last one.

---

Still, as long as I get trotted out for Christmas Courts and state occasions now and then – for I do like to see you – it’s enough.

---

Do you still need the Vexin, Henry?


---

## HENRY:
Need you ask?

---

## ELEANOR:
My strategy is ten years old.

---

## HENRY:
It is as crucial as it ever was.

---

My troops there are a day away from Paris, just a march of twenty miles.

---

I must keep it.


---

## ELEANOR:
I’d say all the jollying this room can stand.

---

I’m famished.

---

Let’s go in to dinner.


---

## HENRY:
Arm in arm.

---

## ELEANOR:
And hand in hand.

---

You’re still a marvel of a man.

---

## HENRY:
And you’re my lady.

---

## ELEANOR:
Henry, dear, if Alais doesn’t marry Richard, I will see you lose the Vexin.

---

## HENRY:
Well, I thought you’d never say it.

---

## ELEANOR:
I can do it.


---

## HENRY:
You can try.

---

## ELEANOR:
My Richard is the next king, not your John.

---

I know you, Henry.

---

I know every twist and bend you’ve got, and I’ll be waiting round each corner for you.


---

## HENRY:
Do you truly care who’s king?

---

## ELEANOR:
I care because you care so much.


---

## HENRY:
I might surprise you.

---

Eleanor, I’ve fought and bargained all these years as if the only thing I lived for was what happened after I was dead.

---

I’ve something else to live for now.

---

I’ve blundered onto peace.


---

## ELEANOR:
On Christmas Eve.


---

## HENRY:
Since Louis died, while Philip grew, I’ve had no France to fight.

---

And in that lull, I’ve found how good it is to write a law or make a tax more fair or sit in judgement to decide which peasant gets a cow.

---

There is, I tell you, nothing more important in the world.

---

And now the French boy’s big enough and I am sick of war.


---

## ELEANOR:
Come to your question, Henry; make the plea.

---

What would you have me do?

---

Give out, give up, give in?


---

## HENRY:
Give me a little peace.

---

## ELEANOR:
A little?

---

Why so modest?

---

How about eternal peace?

---

Now there’s a thought.


---

## HENRY:
If you oppose me, I will strike you any way I can.

---

## ELEANOR:
Of course, you will.

Henry?


---

## HENRY:
Madam?

---

## ELEANOR:
Did you ever love me?

---

## HENRY:
No.

---

## ELEANOR:
Good.

---

That will make this pleasanter.


---

## RICHARD:
All right.

---

I’ve come.

---

I’m here.

---

What was it you wanted?


---

## ELEANOR:
Just to talk.

---

We haven’t been alone, the two of us, in – How long is it, lamb?

---

Two years?

---

You look fit.

---

War agrees with you.

---

I keep informed.

---

I follow all your slaughters from a distance.

---

Do sit down.


---

## RICHARD:
Is this an audience, a goodnight kiss or an ambush?


---

## ELEANOR:
Let us hope it’s a reunion.

---

Must you look so stern?

---

I sent for you to say I want your love again, but I can’t say it to a face like that.


---

## RICHARD:
My love, of all things.

---

What could you want it for?


---

## ELEANOR:
Why, for itself.

---

What other purpose could I have?


---

## RICHARD:
You’ll tell me when you’re ready to.


---

## ELEANOR:
I scheme a lot; I know.

---

That’s how a queen in prison spends her time.

---

But there is more to me than that.

---

Can’t I say I love a son and be believed?


---

## RICHARD:
If I were you, I’d try another tack.

---

I have not damned-up floods of passion for you.

---

There’s no chance I’ll overflow.


---

## ELEANOR:
You are a dull boy.

---

## RICHARD:
Am I?

---

## ELEANOR:
Dull as plainsong: la, la, la, forever on one note.

---

I gave the Church up out of boredom.

---

I can do as much for you.


---

## RICHARD:
You’ll never give me up; not while I hold the Aquitaine.


---

## ELEANOR:
You think I’m motivated by a love of property?


---

## RICHARD:
I think you want it back.

---

You’re so deceitful you can’t ask for water when you’re thirsty.


---

## ELEANOR:
If I’m so devious, why don’t you go?

---

Don’t stand there quivering in limbo.

---

Love me, little lamb, or leave me.


---

## RICHARD:
Leave you, madam?

---

With pure joy.


---

## ELEANOR:
Departure is a simple act.

---

You put the left foot down and then the right.


---

## JOHN:
Mother –


---

## ELEANOR:
Hush, dear.

---

Mother’s fighting.

---

## JOHN:
Father’s coming with the treaty terms.


---

## ELEANOR:
No doubt he’s told you what they are.


---

## JOHN:
He doesn’t have to.

---

Don’t’ you think I know what’s what?


---

## ELEANOR:
Of course, you do, dear.

---

Has he put the terms to Philip?

---

## HENRY:
Not yet, but we’re shortly granting him an audience.

---

I hope you’ll attend.


---

## ELEANOR:
Are we to know the terms or have you come to tease us?


---

## RICHARD:
What are you giving up to Philip?

---

What of mine?


---

## JOHN:
Whatever you’ve got goes to me.

---

## GEOFFREY:
And what’s the nothing Geoffrey gets?


---

## HENRY:
For God’s sake, boys, you can’t all three be king.

---

## RICHARD:
All three of us can try.

---

## HENRY:
That’s pointless now.

---

The treaty calls for you to marry Alais and you shall.

---

I want you to succeed me, Richard.

---

Alais and the crown: I give you both.


---

## RICHARD:
I’ve got no sense of humor.

---

If I did, I’d laugh.

---

## HENRY:
I’ve used you badly, haven’t I?

---

## RICHARD:
You’ve used me cleverly and well.


---

## HENRY:
Not anymore.

---

I mean to do it.

---

## JOHN:
What about me?

---

I’m your favorite, I’m the one you love.


---

## HENRY:
John.

---

I can’t help myself.

---

Stand next to Richard.

---

See how you compare.

---

Could you keep anything I gave you?

---

Could you beat him on the field?


---

## JOHN:
You could.

---

## HENRY:
But, John, I’ won’t be there.

---

## JOHN:
Let’s fight him now.

---

## HENRY:
How can I?

---

There’s no way to win.

---

I’m losing too, John.

---

All my dreams for you are lost.


---

## JOHN:
You’ve led me on.


---

## HENRY:
I never meant to.

---

## JOHN:
You’re a failure as a father, you know that.

---

## HENRY:
I’m sorry, John.

---

## JOHN:
Not yet you’re not.

---

But I’ll do something terrible and you’ll be sorry then.


---

## ELEANOR:
Did you rehearse all this or are you improvising?


---

## HENRY:
Good God, woman, face the facts.


---

## ELEANOR:
Which ones?

---

We’ve got so many.


---

## HENRY:
Power is the only fact.

He is our ablest son.

---

He is the strongest, isn’t he?

---

How can I keep him from the crown?

---

He’d only take it if I didn’t give it to him.


---

## ELEANOR:
No – you’d make me fight to get it.

---

I know you: you’d never give me everything.


---

## HENRY:
Ture – and I haven’t.

---

You get Alais and you get the kingdom, but I get the one thing I want most.

---

If you’re king, England stays intact.

---

I get that.

---

It’s all yours now – the girl, the crown, the whole black bloody business.

---

Isn’t that enough?


---

## ALAIS:
I don’t know whose to be congratulated.

---

Not me, certainly.
You got me for your Richard.

---

How’d you manage it?

---

Did you tell him he’s your wooly lamb?

---

Or say how much you like it in your prison?


---

## ELEANOR:
It’s all lies but I told him.


---

## ALAIS:
Kings, queens, knights everywhere you look and I’m the only pawn.

---

I haven’t got a thing to lose: that makes me – dangerous.

---

## ELEANOR:
Poor child.

---

## JOHN:
Poor John – who says poor John?

---

Don’t everybody sob at once.

---

My God, if I went up on flames, there’s not a living soul who’d pee on me to put the fire out.


---

## RICHARD:
Let’s strike a flint and see.

---

## JOHN:
He hates me.

---

Why?

---

What should he hate me for?

---

Am I the eldest son?

---

Am I the heir?

---

Am I the hero?

---

What’s my crime?

---

Is it some childhood score, some baby hurt?

---

When I was six and you were sixteen, did I brutalize you?

---

What?


---

## ELEANOR:
For whatever I have done to you, forgive me.


---

## JOHN:
What could you have done?

---

You were never close enough.


---

## ELEANOR:
When you were little, you were torn from me: blame Henry.


---

## JOHN:
I was torn from your midwives and I haven’t seen you since.

---

## ELEANOR:
Then blame me if it helps.

---

## RICHARD:
No, it’s the midwives’ fault.

---

They threw the baby out and kept the afterbirth.


---

## JOHN:
You’re everything a little brother dreams of.

---

You know that?

---

I used to dream about you all the time.


---

## ELEANOR:
Oh, Johnny…

---

## JOHN:
That’s right, Mother; mother me.


---

## ELEANOR:
Yes, if you’d let me.

---

## JOHN:
Let you?

---

Let you put your arms around me just the way you never did?
You can do it.

---

Think I’m Richard.
That’s it.

---

That’s the way.

---

Now kiss my scabby cheek and run your fingers through my hair.


---

## ELEANOR:
John, John…

---

## JOHN:
No – it’s all false.

---

You know what I am?

---

I’m the family nothing.

---

Geoffrey’s shrewd and Richard’s brave and I’m not anything.


---

## ELEANOR:
You are to me.


---

## JOHN:
I’ll show you, Eleanor.

---

I haven’t lost yet.
Goeff.

---

## GEOFFREY:
Run along.

---

I’m busy now.

---

## JOHN:
I give the orders.

---

I’m the master.

---

When I call, you come.


---

## GEOFFREY:
There’s news in Chinon, John.

---

That falling sound was you.

---

## JOHN:
The woods are full of chancellors.

---

## GEOFFREY:
And the castle’s full of kings.

---

## JOHN:
Oh, you’re not really leaving me?


---

## GEOFFREY:
No; I’ve already left.


---

## JOHN:
I don’t care.

---

I don’t need anybody.

---

## GEOFFREY:
Well, Mummy, here I am.

---

## ELEANOR:
John’s lost a chancellor, has he?

---

## GEOFFREY:
And you’ve gained one.

---

## ELEANOR:
It’s a bitter thing your Mummy has to say.

---

## GEOFFREY:
She doesn’t trust me.


---

## ELEANOR:
You know Henry isn’t through with John.

---

He’ll keep the Vexin until the moon goes blue from cold and as for Richard’s wedding day, we’ll the see the second coming first; the needlework can last for years.


---

## GEOFFREY:
I know.

---

You know I know.

---

I know you know I know; we know that Henry knows, and Henry knows we know it.

---

We’re a knowledgeable family.

---

Do you want my services or don’t you?


---

## ELEANOR:
Why are you dropping John?

---

## GEOFFREY:
Because you’re going to win.

---

## ELEANOR:
I haven’t yet.

---

## GEOFFREY:
You will with me to help you.

---

I can handle John.

---

I’ll take him by the hand and walk him into any trap you set.


---

## ELEANOR:
You’re good, you’re first class, Geoff.

---

Did John agree?


---

## GEOFFREY:
To what?

---

## ELEANOR:
To making you his chancellor when you betray me?

---

## GEOFFREY:
I Have some principles.

---

## ELEANOR:
Then how much did you get from Henry?

---

## GEOFFREY:
Get from Henry?

---

## ELEANOR:
What’s the fee for selling me to him?

---

Or have you found some way of selling everyone to everybody?


---

## GEOFFREY:
Not yet, Mumm, but I’m working on it.

---

I don’t care who’s king, but you and Henry do.

---

I want to watch the two of you go picnicking on one another.


---

## ELEANOR:
Yes, it’s true; you really mean it.

---

## GEOFFREY:
Do you really blame me?

---

## ELEANOR:
You’ve a gift for hating.

---

## GEOFFREY:
You’re the expert; you should know.


---

## ELEANOR:
You’ve loved me all these years.


---

## GEOFFREY:
Well, God forgive me, I’ve upset the Queen Madam, you may rot.

---

## ELEANOR:
All right.

---

We need you.

---

Help us.

---

## GEOFFREY:
What?

---

And miss the fun of selling you?


---

## ELEANOR:
Be Richard’s chancellor.


---

## GEOFFREY:
Rot.

---

## ELEANOR:
Oh, Geoffrey.

---

Well, that’s how deals are made.

---

We’ve got him if we want him.

---

I should like some wine.

---

Why did I have to have such clever children?

---

He will sell us all, you know; but only if he thinks we think he won’t.

---

Scenes.

---

I can’t touch my sons except in scenes.
What’s the matter, Richard?

---

## RICHARD:
Nothing.

---

## ELEANOR:
It’s a very heavy thing, your nothing.

---

When I write or send for you to speak or reach, your nothings come.

---

Like stones.


---

## RICHARD:
Don’t play a scene with me.


---

## ELEANOR:
I wouldn’t if I could.

---

## RICHARD:
There’d be no profit in it.

---

That’s my one advantage over you.

---

You’re wiser, shrewder, more experienced.

---

I’m colder; I feel less.


---

## ELEANOR:
Why, you don’t know yourself at all.

---

I’ve known who I am for some years now.

---

I had, at one time, many appetites.

---

I wanted poetry and power and young men who create them both.

---

I even wanted Henry, too, in those days.

---

Now I’ve only one desire left: to see you king.


---

## RICHARD:
The only thing you want to see is Father’s vitals on a bed of lettuce.

---

You don’t care who wins as long as Henry loses.

---

You’d see Philip on the English throne.

---

You’d feed us to the Frans or hand us to the Holy Romans.

---

You’d do anything.


---

## ELEANOR:
That’s good to know.

---

## RICHARD:
You are Medusa to the teeth but this one son you won’t use for vengeance on your husband.


---

## ELEANOR:
I could bend you.

---

I could wear you like a bracelet – but I’d sooner die.


---

## RICHARD:
You’re old enough to die, in any case.


---

## ELEANOR:
How my captivity has changed you.

---

Henry meant to hurt me, and he’s hacked you up instead.

---

More wine.
Men coveted this talon once.

---

Henry was eighteen when we met, and I was Queen of France.

---

He came down from the North to Paris with a mind like Aristotle’s and a form like a mortal sin.

---

We shattered the Commandments, on the spot.

---

I spent three months annulling Louis and in spring, in May not far from here, we married.

---

Young Count Henry and his Countess.

---

But in three years’ time, I was his Queen, and he was King of England.

---

Done at twenty-one.

---

Five years your junior, General.


---

## RICHARD:
I can count.

---

## ELEANOR:
No doubt the picture of your parents being fond does not hang in your gallery – but we were fond.

---

There was no Thomas Becket then, or Rosamund.

---

No rivals – only me.

---

And then young Henry came and you and all the blossoms in my garden.

---

Yes, if I’d been sterile, darling, I’d be happier today.


---

## RICHARD:
Is that designed to hurt me?

---

## ELEANOR:
What a waste.

---

I’ve fought with Henry over who comes next, whose dawn is it and which son gets the sunset, and we’ll never live to see it.

---

Look at you.

---

I loved you more than Henry and it’s cost me everything.


---

## RICHARD:
What do you want?

---

## ELEANOR:
I want us back the way we were.

---

## RICHARD:
That’s not it.

---

## ELEANOR:
All right, then.

---

I want the Aquitaine.


---

## RICHARD:
Now that’s the mother I remember.


---

## ELEANOR:
No, it’s not at all, but if you find her more congenial, she’s the one you’ll get.

---

We can win.

---

I can get you Alais.

---

I can make the marriage happen – but I’ve got to have the Aquitaine to do it.

---

I must have it back.


---

## RICHARD:
You were better in your scene with Geoffrey.


---

## ELEANOR:
Shall I write my will?

---

“To Richard, everything.

---

” Would you believe me then?

---

Where’s paper?


---

## RICHARD:
Paper burns.

---

## ELEANOR:
And tears and turns to pudding in the rain.

---

What can I do?


---

## RICHARD:
I did think Geoffrey put it nicely.

---

You can rot.

---

## ELEANOR:
I love you.


---

## RICHARD:
You love nothing.

---

You are incomplete.

---

The human parts of you are missing.

---

You’re as dead as you are deadly.


---

## ELEANOR:
Don’t leave me.

---

## RICHARD:
You were lovely once.

---

I’ve seen the pictures.


---

## ELEANOR:
Oh, don’t you remember how you loved me?

---

## RICHARD:
Vaguely – like a legend.

---

## ELEANOR:
You remember.

---

We were always hand in hand.
That’s how it felt.

---

## RICHARD:
As coarse and hot as that.


---

## ELEANOR:
This won’t burn.

---

I’ll scratch a will on this.
To Richard, everything.


---

## RICHARD:
Mother!


---

## ELEANOR:
Remember how I taught you numbers and the lute and poetry?

---

## RICHARD:
Mother.

---

## ELEANOR:
See?

---

You do remember.

---

I taught you dancing too, and languages and all the music that I knew and how to love what’s beautiful.

---

The sun was warmer then and we were every day together.

---

## GEOFFREY:
John – there you are.

---

## JOHN:
Go find yourself another fool.

---

## GEOFFREY:
You’re angry: good.

---

Now, here’s my plan.


---

## JOHN:
You are a rancid bastard.

---

Want to fight?


---

## GEOFFREY:
John, use your head.

---

Would I betray you?

---

## JOHN:
Why not?

---

Everybody else does.


---

## GEOFFREY:
John, I only turned on you to get their confidence.

---

It worked; they trust me.


---

## JOHN:
I tell you; your leg could fall off at the pelvis and I wouldn’t trust the stump to bleed.


---

## GEOFFREY:
If you’re not king, I’m nothing.

---

You’re my way to power, John.

---

## JOHN:
I still don’t trust you.

---

## GEOFFREY:
Always put your faith in vices.

---

Trust my slyness if you think I’m sly.

---

Make use of me, deceive me, cast me off – but not until I’ve made you king.


---

## JOHN:
You think I can’t out-think you, do you?

---

All right, what’s your plan?


---

## GEOFFREY:
We’ve got to make a deal with Philip.

---

## JOHN:
Why?


---

## GEOFFREY:
Because you’re out and Richard’s in.

---

## JOHN:
What kind of deal?

---

## GEOFFREY:
A war.

---

If we three join and fight now, we can finish Richard off.

---

## JOHN:
And Mother, too?

---

## GEOFFREY:
And Mother, too.

---

Well, do we do it?

---

Is it on?

---

## JOHN:
I’ve got to think.

---

## GEOFFREY:
We’re extra princes now.

---

You know where extra princes go.

---

## JOHN:
Down?


---

## GEOFFREY:
Very down.

---

## PHILIP:
I see I’m early for my audience.

---

Or am I late?


---

## GEOFFREY:
No, you’re exquisitely on time.

---

I feel the strangest sense of kinship with you, Philip.


---

## PHILIP:
So, you’ve sensed it, too.

---

## GEOFFREY:
How far around the corner were you?

---

## PHILIP:
How did you know?

---

## GEOFFREY:
You came in so conveniently.

---

## PHILIP:
I’ll learn.


---

## GEOFFREY:
Well, was there anything you didn’t overhear?


---

## PHILIP:
John’s answer.

---

Does he want a war or doesn’t he?


---

## GEOFFREY:
Do you?

---

If John asks for your soldiers, will he get them?

---

## PHILIP:
If John wants a war, he’s got one.

---

## GEOFFREY:
John, you hear that?

---

## JOHN:
I’m still thinking.

---

## GEOFFREY:
Let me help.

---

It’s either Richard on the throne or you.

---

## JOHN:
You think we’d win?


---

## PHILIP:
I know it.

---

## JOHN:
Father’s coming.

---

## GEOFFREY:

This way.

---

We’ve got plans to make.

John.

---

## JOHN:
In a minute.

---

## HENRY:
I’d appreciate a little quiet confidence.

---

I have enough nits picking at me.

---

## JOHN:
Father, have you got a minute?


---

## HENRY:
What for?

---

## JOHN:
If you had a minute, we could talk.

---

## HENRY:
I’m busy now.

---

Have you seen Philip?


---

## JOHN:
Look: you know that hunting trip we’re taking for my birthday?

---

## HENRY:
Well?

---

## JOHN:
Forget it.

---

I’m not going.

---

## HENRY:
Why not?

---

## JOHN:
I’m just not.


---

## HENRY:
But, John, the trip’s all planned.

---

## JOHN:
I’ll go get Philip for you.

---

## HENRY:
You did have a good time last year, didn’t you?

---

## JOHN:
I loved it.

---

## HENRY:
What’s wrong, lad?

---

## JOHN:
You’re busy.

---

## HENRY:
True enough but –

---

## JOHN:
You’ve got more important things to do.


---

## HENRY:
I can’t make things all right if I don’t know what’ s wrong.

---

## JOHN:
You’re giving Richard everything.

---

## HENRY:
You think I’d do that?

---

## JOHN:
You don’t love me anymore.

---

## HENRY:
Don’t pout – and stand up straight.

---

How often do I have to tell you?

---

## JOHN:
When’s my coronation?

---

## HENRY:
When I say so.

---

## JOHN:
That’s no answer.

---

## HENRY:
John.

---

## JOHN:
Tell her how much you love her.

---

You’re a wonder with women.

---

## HENRY:
What in hell was that about?

---

## ALAIS:
He heard you disinherit you upstairs and wondered if you meant it.


---

## HENRY:
If I meant it?

---

When I’ve fathered him and mothered him and babied him?

---

He’s all I’ve got.

---

How often does he have to hear it?

---

Every supper?


---

## ALAIS:
I heard you promise me to Richard.

---

## HENRY:
You don’t think I meant it?


---

## ALAIS:
I think you enjoy it, passing me from hand to hand.

---

What am I to you – a collection plate?


---

## HENRY:
I’ve got to get the Aquitaine for John.


---

## ALAIS:
I talk people and you answer back in provinces.


---

## HENRY:
They get it mixed up.

---

What’s the Aquitaine to Eleanor?

---

It’s not a province, it’s a way to torture me.

---

That’ s why she’s upstairs wooing Richard, wheezing on the coals.

---

She’ll squeeze it out of him.

---

God, but I’d love to eavesdrop.
I taught you prancing, lamb, and lute and flute –


---

## ELEANOR:
That’s marvelous; it’s absolutely me.
What a tree.

---

There you are.

---

I thought as long as I was coming down, I’d bring them.


---

## HENRY:
Whatever are you giving me?

---

## ELEANOR:
You’re such a child: you always ask.

---

## HENRY:
To Henry.
Heavy.

It’s my headstone.

---

Eleanor, you spoil me.


---

## ELEANOR:
I never could deny you anything.


---

## ALAIS:
You’ve grown old gracefully, you two.

---

I’ll give you that.

---

## HENRY:
Don’t go.

---

It nettles her to see how much I need you.


---

## ALAIS:
You need me, Henry, like a tailor needs a tinker’s dam.

---

## HENRY:
Alais –

---

## ALAIS:
I know that look.

---

He’s going to say he loves me.

---

## HENRY:
Like my life.

I talk like that to keep her spirits up.

---

Well, how’d you do with Richard?

---

Did you break his heart?


---

## ELEANOR:
You think he ought to give me back the Aquitaine?


---

## HENRY:
I can’t think why he shouldn’t.

---

After all, I’ve promised him the throne.


---

## ELEANOR:
The boy keeps wondering if your promises are any good.


---

## HENRY:
There’s no sense asking if the air’s good when there’s nothing else to breathe.


---

## ELEANOR:
Exactly what I told him.

---

## HENRY:
Have you got it?

---

Will he give it back?


---

## ELEANOR:
How can you think I’d ever pass it on to John?

---

## HENRY:
It matters to me desperately.

---

## ELEANOR:
Why should it?

---

Does it matter what comes after us?


---

## HENRY:
Ask any sculptor, “why don’t you work in butter?

---

”


---

## ELEANOR:
Is Johnny bronze?

---

He’ll go as green from mold as any of our sons.


---

## HENRY:
I know that.

---

Richard gets the throne.

---

You heard my promise.

---

What else do you want?


---

## ELEANOR:
No Aquitaine for John.

---

## HENRY:
I’ve got to give him something.

---

Isn’t some agreement possible?


---

## ELEANOR:
Love, in a world where carpenters get resurrected, anything is possible.


---

## HENRY:
You bore him, dammit; he’s your son.


---

## ELEANOR:
Oh, heavens yes.

---

Two hundred eighty days I bore him.

---

I recall them all.

---

You’d only just found Rosamund.


---

## HENRY:
Why her so damn particularly.

---

I’ve found other women.

---

## ELEANOR:
Countless others.


---

## HENRY:
What’s your count?

---

Let’s have a tally of the bedspreads you’ve spread out on.


---

## ELEANOR:
Thomas Becket’s

---

## HENRY:
That’s a lie.

---

## ELEANOR:
I know it.

---

Jealousy looks silly on us, Henry.

---

## HENRY:
Doesn’t it.

---

## ELEANOR:
You still care what I do.

---

## HENRY:
I want the Aquitaine for John.

---

I want it and I’ll have it.


---

## ELEANOR:
Is that menace you’re conveying?

---

Is it to be torture?

---

Will you boil me or stretch me, which?

---

Or am I to be perforated?


---

## HENRY:
I have the documents and you will sign.


---

## ELEANOR:
How can you force me to?

---

Threats?

---

Sign or I refuse to feed you?

---

Tears?

---

Bribes, offers, deals?

---

I’m like the earth, old man; there isn’t any way around me.


---

## HENRY:
I adore you.

---

## ELEANOR:
Save your aching arches; that road is closed.

---

## HENRY:
I’ve got an offer for you, ma Jolie.

---

## ELEANOR:
A deal, a deal.

---

I give the richest province on the Continent to John for what?

---

You tell me, mastermind.

---

For what?


---

## HENRY:
Your freedom.


---

## ELEANOR:
Oh.

---

## HENRY:
Once Johnny has the Aquitaine, you’re free.

---

I’ll let you out.

---

Think: on the loose in London, winters in Provence, impromptu trips to visit Richard anywhere he’s killing people.

---

All that for a signature.


---

## ELEANOR:
You’re good.

---

## HENRY:
I thought it might appeal to you.

---

You always fancied travelling.


---

## ELEANOR:
Yes, I did.

---

I even made poor Louis take me on Crusade.

---

How’s that for blasphemy?

---

I dressed by maids as Amazons and rode bare breasted halfway to Damascus.

---

Louis had a seizure and I damn near died of windburn, but the troops were dazzled.

---

Henry, I’m against the wall.


---

## HENRY:
Because I’ve put you there, don’t think I like to see it.


---

## ELEANOR:
I believe it; you do feel for me.

---

To be a prisoner, to be bricked in when you’ve known the world – I’ll never know how I’ve survived.

---

These ten years, Henry, have been unimaginable.

---

You give your falcons more affection than I get.


---

## HENRY:
My falcons treat me better.

---

## ELEANOR:
Handle me with iron gloves, then.


---

## HENRY:
Sign the papers and we’ll break the happy news.

---

The Queen is free, John joins the landed gentry, Philip’s satisfied, and Richard gets a princess.


---

## ELEANOR:
Yes.

---

Let’s have it done.

---

I’ll sign.

---

On one condition.

---

## HENRY:
Name it.

---

## ELEANOR:
Have the wedding now.


---

## HENRY:
What’s that?

---

## ELEANOR:
Why, I’ve surprised you.

---

Surely, it’s not sudden.

---

They’ve been marching down the aisle for sixteen years and that’s a long walk.

---

John can be the best man – that’s a laugh – and you can give the bride away.

---

I want to watch you do it.


---

## HENRY:
Alais – I can live without her.

---

## ELEANOR:
And I thought you loved her.

---

## HENRY:
So I do.

---

## ELEANOR:
Thank God.

---

You frightened me: I was afraid this wouldn’t hurt.


---

## HENRY:
You fill me full of fear and pity.

---

What a tragedy you are.


---

## ELEANOR:
I wonder, do you ever wonder if I slept with Geoffrey?

---

## HENRY:
With my father?

---

## ELEANOR:
It’s not true but one hears rumors.

---

Don’t you ever wonder?


---

## HENRY:
Is it rich, despising me?

---

Is it rewarding?

---

## ELEANOR:
No – it’s terrible.

---

## HENRY:
Then stop it.

---

## ELEANOR:
How?

---

It’s what I live for.

---

## HENRY:
Rosamund, I loved you!


---

## ELEANOR:
(Calling.

---

)
John – Richard – Geoffrey.

---

## HENRY:
Where’s a priest?

---

I’ll do it.

---

I’ll show you.

---

By Christ, I will.
Somebody dig me up a priest.

---

## JOHN:
What for?

---

What’s happening?

---

## ELEANOR:
Richard’s getting married.

---

## JOHN:
Now?

---

He’s getting married now?

---

## ELEANOR:
I never cease to marvel at the quickness of your mind.


---

## JOHN:
You can’t hurt me, you bag of bile, no matter what you say.
But you can.

---

Father, why?

---

## HENRY:
Because I say so.
You.

---

Bring me a bishop.

---

## ELEANOR:
Get old Durham.

---

He’ll be in the chapel. 
You’ll make a lovely bride.

---

I wonder if I’ll cry.


---

## ALAIS:
You sound as if you think it’s going to happen.

---

## ELEANOR:
And I do.


---

## ALAIS:
He’s only plotting.

---

Can’t you tell when Henry’s plotting.

---

## ELEANOR:
Not this time.

---

## ALAIS:
He’ll never give me up.

---

## HENRY:
You think I won’t?

---

## ALAIS:
Because you told me so.

---

## HENRY:
You’re not my Helen; I won’t fight a war to save a face.

---

We are done.

---

## ALAIS:
I don’t believe you.

---

## HENRY:
Wait ten minutes.


---

## GEOFFREY:

Durham is waiting in the chapel.

---

## HENRY:
Good – let’s get it over with.

---

## ALAIS:
Don’t do this to me, Henry.

---

## HENRY:
Go to him.

---

## ALAIS:
Not yet –

I am your sister.

---

Can’t you find some pity for me?

Maman, you won’t let this happen.

Henry, if you ever loved me –


I won’t do it.

---

I won’t say the words, not one of them.

---

Henry, please.

---

It makes no sense.

---

Why give me up?

---

What are you gaining?

---

## HENRY:
The Aquitaine, of course.

---

## RICHARD:
What’s that?

---

## HENRY:
The Aquitaine.

---

Your mother gets her freedom and I get the Aquitaine.

That is the proposition, isn’t it?

---

You did agree.

---

## RICHARD:
Of course she did.

---

I knew, I knew it.

---

It was all pretense.

---

You used me.

---

God, and I believed you.

---

I believed it all.


---

## ELEANOR:
I meant it all.

---

## RICHARD:
No wedding.

---

There will be no wedding.

---

## HENRY:
But my boy –


---

## RICHARD:
Not at this price.


---

## HENRY:
But Durham’s waiting.


---

## RICHARD:
She’s not worth the Aquitaine.

---

## HENRY:
You’ve simply got to marry her.

---

It isn’t much to ask.

---

For my sake, Richard.


---

## RICHARD:
Never.

---

## HENRY:
But I’ve promised Philip.

---

Think of my position.


---

## RICHARD:
Damn the wedding and to hell with your position.

---

## HENRY:
You don’t dare defy me.

---

## RICHARD:
Don’t I?

---

## HENRY:
You’re the King of France, for God’s sake.

---

Speak up.

---

Do something.


---

## RICHARD:
Make a threat, why don’t you?

---

Scare me.

---

## PHILIP:
You dunce.

---

## RICHARD:
Am I?

---

## PHILIP:
He never meant to have the wedding.

---

## HENRY:
Say again?

---

## PHILIP:
You’re good at rage.

---

I like the way you play it.


---

## HENRY:
Boy, don’t ever call a king a liar to his face.


---

## PHILIP:
I’m not a boy.

---

To you or anybody.

---

## HENRY:
Boy, you came here asking for a wedding or the Vexin back.

---

By God, you don’t get either one.

---

It’s no to both.

---

## PHILIP:
You have a pact with France.

---

## HENRY:
Then damn the document and damn the French.

---

She’ll never marry, not while I’m alive.


---

## PHILIP:
Your life and never are two different times.


---

## HENRY:
Not on my clock, boy.

---

## RICHARD:
Listen to the lion.


---

## HENRY:
Don’t spoil it, Richard.

---

## RICHARD:
How’s your bad leg?

---

## HENRY:
Better, thank you.

---

## RICHARD:
And your back and all the rest of it?

---

You’re getting old.

---

One day you’ll have me once too often.


---

## HENRY:
When?

---

I’m fifty now.

---

My God, boy, I’m the oldest man I know.

---

I’ve got a decade on the Pope.

---

What’s it to be?

---

The broadsword when I’m eighty- five?


---

## RICHARD:
I’m not a second son.

---

Not now.

---

Your Henry’s in the vault, you know.

---

## HENRY:
I know; I’ve seen him there.


---

## RICHARD:
I’ll have the crown.

---

## HENRY:
You’ll have what daddy gives you.

---

## RICHARD:
I am next in line.

---

## HENRY:
To nothing.

---

## RICHARD:
Then we’ll have the broadswords now.

---

## HENRY:
This minute?

---

## RICHARD:
On the battlefield.

---

## HENRY:
So, we’re at war.


---

## RICHARD:
Yes, we’re at war.

---

I have two thousand men at Poitiers.


---

## HENRY:
Can they hear you?

---

Call and see who comes.

---

You are as close to Poitiers as you’re going to get.


---

## RICHARD:
You don’t dare hold me prisoner.

---

## HENRY:
You’re a king’s son so I treat you with respect.

---

You have the freedom of the castle.


---

## RICHARD:
You can’t keep me here.

---

## HENRY:
Until we’ve all agreed that John comes next, I can and will.


---

## RICHARD:
The castle doesn’t’ stand that holds me.

---

Post your guards.

---

## JOHN:
My God.

---

I’m king again.

---

Fantastic.

---

It’s a miracle.
Are you happy for me Geoff?

---

## GEOFFREY:
I am happy for us both.

---

## ELEANOR:
I came close, didn’t I?

I almost had my freedom and I almost had you for my son.

---

I should have liked it being free.
You played it nicely.

---

You were good.


---

## HENRY:
I really was.

---

I fooled you, didn’t I?

---

God, but do I love being king.


---

## ELEANOR:
Well, Henry, liege and lord, what happens now?


---

## HENRY:
I have no idea.

---

I know I’m winning and I know I’ll win but what the next move is –
You’re not scared?

---

## ELEANOR:
No.

---

## HENRY:
I think you are.

---

## ALAIS:
I was.

---

You mustn’t play with feelings, Henry; not with mine.


---

## HENRY:
It wasn’t possible to lose you.

---

I must hold you dearer than I thought.
You’ve got your enigmatic face on.

---

“What’s your mood, I wonder?

---

”


---

## ELEANOR:
Pure delight.

---

I’m locked up with my sons: what mother wouldn’t dream of that?
One thing.

---

## HENRY:
Yes?

---

## ELEANOR:
May I watch you kiss her?

---

## HENRY:
Can’t you ever stop?

---

## ELEANOR:
I watch you every night.

---

I conjure it before I sleep.

---

## HENRY:
Leave it at that.

---

## ELEANOR:
My curiosity is intellectual: I want to see how accurate I am.


---

## HENRY:
Forget the dragon in the doorway: come.
Believe I love you, for I do.

---

Believe I’m yours forever, for I am.

---

Believe in my contentment and the joy you give me and believe –
You want more?
I’m an old man in an empty place.

---

Be with me.
