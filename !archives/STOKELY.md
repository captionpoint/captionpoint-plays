## KWAME TURE:
Not keeping food down lately.

Food gives you strength.

## KWAME TURE:
Purpose gives me strength. Got to finish. 

---

## MAY CHARLES:
Finish what? 

---

## KWAME TURE:
Recording.

---

## MAY CHARLES:
Recording what?

---

## KWAME TURE:
My history. It's tedious.

---

## MAY CHARLES:
Do tell. 

---

## KWAME TURE:
Some memories flow. Others don't.

---

## MAY CHARLES:
Needs to be forgotten then.

---

## KWAME TURE:
I think I need someone I love and trust to tell it to.

---

## MAY CHARLES:
So you send for me.

---

## KWAME TURE:
Bingo. 

---

## MAY CHARLES:
I'm flattered. Wait. Am I in there?

---

## MAY CHARLES:
A school.

## KWAME TURE:
Of sorts.

## MAY CHARLES:

---

## KWAME TURE:
All my intellectual property.
Manuscripts. Photographs. Recordings-

---

## MAY CHARLES:
Me? Make a school?

---

## KWAME TURE:
Yes.

---

## MAY CHARLES:
Me? A retired steamship stewardess?

---

## KWAME TURE:
Yes.

---

## MAY CHARLES:
How? I ain't a carpenter like Father was.

---

## KWAME TURE:
By gathering the properties.

---

## MAY CHARLES:

---

## KWAME TURE:

---

## KWAME TURE:

---

## MAY CHARLES:

## KWAME TURE:

---

## KWAME TURE:
Focus, Ma. 

---

## MAY CHARLES:
Well. 

---

## KWAME TURE:

---

## MAY CHARLES:
Ok. 

---

## KWAME TURE:
Build awareness 

---

## MAY CHARLES:
Ok, ok!  

---

## KWAME TURE:
And be the grieving mother. 

---

## MAY CHARLES:
...Grieving mother? 

---

## KWAME TURE:
Grieving mother. 

---

## MAY CHARLES:
But son, you are not dead. 

---

## KWAME TURE:
I get a call. I go in. They give me some news. I'm out of time.

---

## MAY CHARLES:
A mother is not supposed to bury her son.

---

## KWAME TURE:
Like Superman, I am a machine, Ma. 

---

## MAY CHARLES:
You are a man. 

---

## KWAME TURE:
A machine who organizes. 

---

## MAY CHARLES:
A man who feels. 

---

## KWAME TURE:
Machines break down. 

---

## MAY CHARLES:
You are just sick. 

---

## KWAME TURE:
Machines die. And get used for parts. This is my part.

---

## MAY CHARLES:
What's this nonsense, Kwame?

---

## KWAME TURE:
You’ve got to be Ready for Revolution 

---

## MAY CHARLES:
Well I ain’t. 

---

## KWAME TURE:
-Ready for Revolution!
Say it with me-!

---

## MAY CHARLES:
Nope.

---

## KWAME TURE:
Say it! 

---

## MAY CHARLES:
Nope. 

---

## KWAME TURE:
Say it! 

---

## MAY CHARLES:
I ain’t! 

---

## KWAME TURE:
I am dying! 

---

## MAY CHARLES:
If I agree to what you ask of me, I agree you are dying and I do not agree.

---

## TANTE ELAINE:
MHMM HMMM HMMM HMMM MHMM 

---

## KWAME TURE:
I'm gonna tell God how you treat me!

---

## MAY CHARLES:
Tell God how I treat you?

---

## KWAME TURE:

---

[recorder clicks]

---

## TANTE ELAINE (SINGING): 
I'm gonna tell God how you treat me one of these days, Hallelujah

---

I'm gonna tell God how you treat me, tell God how you treat me one of these days

---

## STOKELY:
They turn me away!

---

## TANTE ELAINE:
Who turn you away?

---

## STOKELY:
The polling place 

---

## TANTE ELAINE:
Polling place? To do what? Vote?! 

---

## STOKELY:
Yes! But the man he turn me away! 
He say 'how old are you boy?'
I say seven.

---

He say 'you got to come back when you twenty-one.'
Twenty-one?! That’s a hundred years from now! 
Take me back to vote! 

---

## TANTE ELAINE:
You can’t vote, boy!

---

## STOKELY:
But you can! 

---

## TANTE ELAINE:
Me? Vote? Nuh uh. 

---

## STOKELY:
You got to Tante Elaine! 
Didn’t the candidate go to jail for our people? 

---

## TANTE ELAINE:
So!  

---

## STOKELY:
So maybe like him one day I go to jail for my people too! 

---

## TANTE ELAINE:
Never think of jail as a place to be! 

---

## STOKELY:
Then what can I do? 

---

## TANTE ELAINE:
Stay colored and die, boy! 

---

## STOKELY:
Colored? What's colored?

---

## TANTE ELAINE:
Our skin is colored. Black. Like night.

---

## STOKELY:
Gradmother Cecelia say I am the smartest most beautiful boy in the world. So if I am colored, Black, then Black is also beautiful.

---

## TANTE ELAINE:
No no no. Black is bad!

---

## STOKELY:
Black is bad?! 

---

## TANTE ELAINE (SINGING):

---

## STOKELY:

---

## TANTE ELAINE (SINGING):

---

## STOKELY:
But how can black be bad--? 

---

## TANTE ELAINE (SINGING):
I'm gonna sit at the welcome table

---

## STOKELY:

---

## TANTE ELAINE (SINGING):
Gonna sit at the welcome table one of these days 

---

[phone rings]

---

## TANTE ELAINE:
Hello-? 

---

## KWAME TURE:
Wait.

[whooshing noise]

---

## MAY CHARLES:
Why you stop, na?

---

## KWAME TURE:
My mind has made these the same moment. But it was later.

---

## MAY CHARLES:
What was later?

---

## TANTE ELAINE:
Stokely, come here. Sit. You almost eleven years so you grown enough to know...

---

You know how Grandmother Cecelia say “bitter in life make you strong?” 

---

This the bitter. 

---

Grandmother Cecelia is now with her Anglican Lord. 

---

## STOKELY:
Can we visit her there and together eat her good sugar cakes? 

---

## TANTE ELAINE:
She dead, boy. 

---

## STOKELY:
I hate b-b-itter! 

---

Where's mother?

---

## TANTE ELAINE:
Don't disrespect, Stokely.

---

## STOKELY:
What, Tante? I want mother!

---

## TANTE ELAINE:
You keep asking me the same question and what is my answer every time?

---

Your mum is gone to America-

---

## STOKELY:
But why?

---

## TANTE ELAINE:
Stokely!

---

## STOKELY:
Why?

---

## KWAME TURE:
Ah chuts, Ma!
What else did Tante Elaine say?

---

## MAY CHARLES:
Probably talking shit like always.

---

## KWAME TURE:
Ma!

---

## MAY CHARLES:
Well. Why record pain?

---

Record joy.

---

## ADOLPHUS (SINGING):
Happy Birthday to you

---

## ALL (SINGING):
Happy Birthday to you, Happy Birthday Dear Stokely, Happy Birthday to you

---

## ADOLPHUS:
Welcome to New York, son! 

---

## STOKELY:
Eleven candles! 

---

## ADOLPHUS:
Make a wish!

---

## MABEL:
Blow out the candles now, Stokely!

---

## ADOLPHUS:
Blow them out, na! 

---

Good job, son! 

---

## MABEL:
What is your wish? 

---

## STOKELY:
My wish? I wish to be...! 

---

[heroic music plays]

“Faster than a speeding bullet! More powerful than a locomotive! Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound!” 

---

“Look! Up in the sky! It's a bird! It's a plane! It's Superman!” 

---

## MABEL:
Stokely! Git down that arse from the ledge this instant! 

---

## MABEL:
Was you tryin’ to fly, son? 

---

## STOKELY:
Yes. Because, Ma. I am Superman.  

---

## MABEL:
Is that right? 

---

## STOKELY:
Yes, Ma’am. 

---

## MABEL:
And who is he? 

---

## STOKELY:
“A strange visitor from another planet who came to Earth with powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal men.” 

---

## MABEL:
Come again? 

---

## STOKELY:
“Superman. Who can change the course of mighty rivers, bend steel with his bare hands, and who, disguised as Clark Kent, mild mannered reporter for a great metropolitan newspaper, 

---

fights a never-ending battle for truth, justice and the American way.” 

---

## MABEL:
Mr. Superman? 

---

## STOKELY:
Yes, Ma? 

---

## MABEL:
Please hand me your cape. 

---

Superman is a white man’s fiction! Do you really think you could fly? You coulda died! 

---

But. I’m. Gonna. Kill. You. First! 

---

Good times! 

---

## KWAME TURE:
Good times. Alright. But you tell me, a boy with a hero, that Superman is white man's fiction?

---

## MAY CHARLES:
I'm not a bad mother.

---

## KWAME TURE:
I didn't say you are.

---

## MAY CHARLES:
The flight was long, Kwame. I am tired.

---

## KWAME TURE:
So are the people. So we cannot tire.

---

## MAY CHARLES:
Ah chuts.

---

[school bell rings]

---

## TEACHER:
P.S. 39 fifth graders---! 

---

## TEACHER:
Welcome to the American educational system, Mr. Carmichael. Take off that old coat. 

---

## STOKELY:
It’s my father’s coat. And it’s cold, ma’am. 

---

## TEACHER:
Cold? But son, it's August ...okay. Class, meet our newest student. Son, tell us who you are and where you are from. 

---

## STOKELY:
I am Stokely Standiford Churchill “Great Man” Carmichael. My home of Trinidad is a place where trees are taller than the sky. 

---

The sky is filled with birds that fly so high I wonder if they can talk to an Anglican God. If they can, I ask them to whisper to God to tell my Grandmother Cecelia that I miss her. 

---

I miss 54 Oxford Street, our home in Port of Spain. My friends walk to school barefoot. 

---

But I wear shoes, shoes I play football in until the soles bleed into the rich soil of earth; shoes I dance to songs we call beats but they call “calypso.” 

---

[calypso plays quietly]

Something wrong wit some kids having shoes and some kids not having shoes. One day, I will fix that. 

---

## A WHITE BOY:
Listen how he talks! 

---

## A WHITE GIRL:
Look at that coat! 

---

## A WHITE BOY:
"Great man?"

---

## TEACHER:
Students, leave him alone-! 

---

## A WHITE GIRL:
Snatch the coat off ‘em! 

---

Monkey in the middle! 

---

## STOKELY:
Hey white girl, don’t call me monkey! 

---

## ADOLPHUS:
Monkey, eh, son? 

---

## STOKELY:
Monkey. 

---

## ADOLPHUS:
Well, you will meet new students soon who perhaps will be up to your standards of intelligence. 

---

## STOKELY:
New students? We are moving?

---

## ADOLPHUS:
Yes, to Morris Park. 

---

## STOKELY:
Where is that? 

---

## ADOLPHUS:
Still the Bronx. But a place where not just some, but everyone doesn't quite look like us.

---

## STOKELY:
Oh? 

---

## ADOLPHUS:
They will be white. 
Well. More like...I-talian. 

---

## JOHN DIMILIO:
Sicie!

---

## STOKELY:
What you say to me?! 

---

## PAULIE:
We're all Sicilian. From Sicily. Siciliano- 

---

## STOKELY:
Do I have to fight you? 

---

## PAULIE:
Fight us? No. We want you to be our brother in blackface. 

---

## JOHN DIMILIO:
Don’t say that, Paulie! He means our dark skinned paisano...our friend. 

---

## STOKELY:
Friend? Oh! I see. 
Sicie! 

---

## JOHN DIMILIO:
Sicie!

---

## PAULIE:
Let’s hit the five and dime. 

---

## JOHN DIMILIO:
Sicie!

---

## PAULIE:
Let’s steal some loot. 

---

## JOHN DIMILIO:
Sicie!

---

## PAULIE:
Let’s make zip guns-! 

---

## STOKELY:
Zip guns? That’s stupid. 

---

## PAULIE:
What’s stupid? You know what the FBI stands for? Forever Bugging I-talians. 

---

The U.S. ain’t never done nothin’ for no dagos like me. 

---

## STOKELY:
If you going to rob someone, you can’t make zip guns and keep going to the same store over and over. 

---

Then they get to know you, man. Go to another neighborhood where don’t nobody know you. Where your, ahem, mother won’t see you. 

---

## PAULIE:
Sicie is smart. 

---

## MAY CHARLES:
Too smart for these clowns. 

---

## KWAME TURE:
Ma, please.

---

## MAY CHARLES:
But they were clowns! Idiots! Nincompoops!
You could've become anything!

---

## KWAME TURE:
Ma!...Oh! Yes!

---

## STOKELY:
Students of PS 83! Elect me to be your 8th grade student council VP! 

---

You got lots of different shades and colors of all high achieving folks but no chocolate! I am high achieving and chocolate! 

---

And I hear I have a voice that will melt the anger of all your I-talian mothers! Vote for me-! 

---


## STUDENTS: 
Okey dokey Vote for Stokey! 

---

## MAY CHARLES:
Okey dokey Vote for Stokey? What is Stokey? We name you Stoke-LY, not Stokey. 

---

## KWAME TURE:

---

## MAY CHARLES:
But I got a recollection or two too!

---

## KWAME TURE:
Fine!

---

## MABEL:
Stokely? You goin’ over to school now, son? 

---

## STOKELY:

---

## KWAME TURE:

---

## MAY CHARLES:
Why you think? 

---

## KWAME TURE:
I know. But it's for the people.

---

## ADOLPHUS:
Trolley should be comin' soon, boy.
Sure you don't want ice cream?

---

Whatsamatta, boy? Cat got yo’ tongue? 

---

## STOKELY:
Huh? 

---

## ADOLPHUS:
Your Grandmother Cecelia used to always say that. That old English expression. It mean you ain’t got no words for your Father, boy. 

---

## STOKELY:
What they do to that Emmett Till boy, Father? 

---

## ADOLPHUS:
We should get ice cream. 

---

## STOKELY:
I want to know the truth. 

---

## ADOLPHUS:
What happened to Emmett Till is not for a boy your age to know. 

---

## STOKELY:
The man in the barber shop says they killed him. That he was 14. I am 14. 

---

## ADOLPHUS:
And 14 should be kept 14- 

---

## STOKELY:
If he is old enough to die, I am old enough to know how, know why--! 

---

## ADOLPHUS:
Stokely-! ...Ima show you something, son. And when you look at it, you will have graduated. 

---

## STOKELY:
But I already graduated. 

---

## ADOLPHUS:
A different kind of graduation. The kind colored boys get. 

---

How’s it taste? 

---

## STOKELY:

## KWAME TURE:

---

## GENE DENNIS:

---

## STOKELY:
Dennis. Carmichael. 

---

## GENE DENNIS:
I know. “C.” Then “D.” They seat us alphabetically. 

---

## STOKELY:
Of course! You read your summer reading list out loud in class. I like Readers Digest. Mystery novels. 

---

## GENE DENNIS:
What of mystery intrigues you? 

---

## STOKELY:
Putting together the pieces. It’s why I will make a good doctor, my father says. The human body is an apparatus-- 

---

## GENE DENNIS:
A machine. 

---

## STOKELY:
Right! A machine! All the pieces working together. 

---

## GENE DENNIS:
You hip to The YCL? 

---

## STOKELY:
The Y.C. wha? 

---

## GENE DENNIS:
The YCL. Young Communist League. 

---

## ADOLPHUS:
Communists?! 

---

## STOKELY:
Yes. 

---

## ADOLPHUS:
No, Son. Reds will kill you! 

---

## STOKELY:
No, he’s not red. Gene Dennis is white. 

---

## ADOLPHUS:
Son. Communists are called Reds. 
And Reds will kill you! 

---

And why be with them reds when you going to be a doctor? 

---

## STOKELY:
They will give me something to fight for. Regular people. People like us. 

---

## ADOLPHUS:
Who is teaching you this drivel? 


---

## GENE DENNIS:
Introducing Bayard Rustin.

---

## BAYARD RUSTIN:
Thank you Gene. Young men, let’s discuss the position of the African man in this wilderness that is America. Do you all know who A. Philip Randolph is? 

---

## STOKELY:

---

## BAYARD RUSTIN:
Who is he then? 

---

## STOKELY:
Uh. Uh...well. You see

## BAYARD RUSTIN:
Well, I’m talking to schooled young men. Well done. You? What is your name? 

---

## STOKELY:
Stokely Standiford Churchill “Great Man” Carmichael, sir. 

---

## BAYARD RUSTIN:
With a name like that, you should only speak when you have correct answers. 

---

## STOKELY:
Yes sir. Thank you, sir. 

---

## BAYARD RUSTIN:
Now during the Second World War, I worked for Mr. Randolph, fighting against racial discrimination in war-related hiring. 
And got jailed several times for my beliefs!

---

## STOKELY:
Went to jail for his beliefs?

---

## BAYARD RUSTIN:
I refuse to register for the draft!
Then I was jailed again for sixty days for moral charges. 

---

## STOKELY:
Moral charges? 

---

## GENE DENNIS:
He’s a queer. 

---

## STOKELY:
So? He went to jail for what he believes. That makes him Superman. Like...

---

## ADOLPHUS:
President Kwame Nkrumah, son. 

---

## STOKELY:
A Black president, father? Where? 

---

## ADOLPHUS:
In Africa. In an independent Ghana, son. I saw them.

---

## STOKELY:
Saw them? How?

---

## ADOLPHUS:
While carpentering on the sea, I saw men, lead by Mr. Nkruman, walk out to take their place on the parliamentary floor.

---

And they are not dressed in the British garb of the court. 
They are dressed like they'd just come from out the jail.

---

Black men! Dressed as convicts! Walk out into a parliamentary floor not wearing the cloak of the oppressor!
Announcing that they are here! Free!

---

## STOKELY:
You okay, father?

---

## ADOLPHUS:
It's joy, son. Pride.
Don't you ever forget the name of The Redeemer. President Kwame Nkrumah.

---

## STOKELY:
I won't, Father.

---

## MAY CHARLES:
Yes, your father had heroes. He wanted to be yours.

---

## KWAME TURE:
But a man can have many heroes!

---

## CROWD:
Welcome, Brother Malcolm! 

---

## MALCOLM X:
Thank you, good people of Harlem! I say to you. If you want to take control of yourself, your lives, do like the Honorable Elijah Muhammad has taught me and pick up a book. 

---

## STOKELY:
Pick up a book! 

---

## MALCOLM X:
Educate yourself about your people. 

---

## STOKELY:
Educate! 

---

## MALCOLM X:
At the Schomburg Library. There you will find out who you are. 

---

## STOKELY:
The Schomburg is amazing, Father! Books on imperialism-Pan-Africanism 

---

## ADOLPHUS:
Your mother picked up your report card from school today. Teacher say two things of note. 

---

## STOKELY:
Whas that, Father? 

---

## ADOLPHUS:
One. You get into Harvard! 

---

## STOKELY:
I did? 

---

## ADOLPHUS:
Yes, son! We are so proud of you! 

---

## STOKELY:
Yes! But, there clearly is a big but...

---

## ADOLPHUS:
But, two, your teacher believes your calling is not medicine, but politics. 

---

## STOKELY:
Yes! 

---

## ADOLPHUS:
Yes? Do you know any other coloreds in politics? Other than Adam Clayton Powell? What chu gon’ do? Form a coup and oust him? 

---

## STOKELY:
I am not trying to oust Adam Clayton Powell 

---

## ADOLPHUS:
Go to Harvard. Start studyin’ with the medicine like Uncle. 

---

## STOKELY:
But what if Teacher is right?  

---

## ADOLPHUS:
A white man? Telling you who you are? 

---

## STOKELY:
Who do I get to be if not to choose who I get to be, like Bayard Rustin 

---

## ADOLPHUS:
Who? 

---

## STOKELY:
And Malcolm X 

---

## ADOLPHUS:
Listening to a man with no last name? 

---

## STOKELY:
And President Kwame Nkrumah! You told me, Father, always remember his name-! 

---

## ADOLPHUS:
President Nkrumah is in Africa! We ain’t in Africa, boy. 

---

## STOKELY:
Maybe politics is what I love. 

---

## ADOLPHUS:
Politics don’t love you! 

---

## STOKELY:
Father-! 

---

## ADOLPHUS:
See Emmett Till’s face in your mind. 

---

## STOKELY:
I will not swallow bitter! 

---

## ADOLPHUS:
Stokely Standiford Churchill Carmichael! 

---

## STOKELY:
I will study medicine, Father. I will go to Harvard. As you wish. 

---

## GENE DENNIS:
Stokes!

---

## STOKELY:
Gene!

---

## GENE DENNIS:
Senior bus trip! We are here in D.C!

---

## STOKELY:
What's that line of Negro boys over there?

---

## GENE DENNIS:
Boys? Psh. Come with me over there to those girls-

---

## JOHN MOODY:
You seen this, man? 

---

## STOKELY:
What is it? 

---

## JOHN MOODY:
Look at this. 

---

## STOKELY:
They are throwing ketchup on them! And pouring sugar in their eyes!

---

## JOHN MOODY:
That's what they do.

---

## STOKELY:
What do we do about it?

---

## JOHN MOODY:
We are doing something about it. What about you?

---

## STOKELY:
Me? I'm with the YCL. Are you?

---

## JOHN MOODY:
YCL? Naw, brother. We ain’t hanging with them white boys. We are NAG. 

---

## STOKELY:
Nag? 

---

## JOHN MOODY:
The Nonviolent Action Group. Campaigning in Virginia and here in D.C. 

---

## STOKELY:
But who are you affiliated with?  

---

## JOHN MOODY:
Howard, brother. Howard University. 

---

## ADOLPHUS:
Howard?

---

## STOKELY:
Yes, Father. I am going to Howard. Negro kids like me are making change. And that’s where I am going to be. 

---

## ADOLPHUS:
Hell no you won't go!

---

## STOKELY:
Hell no I won't go? That's good, I have to remember that one.

---

## ADOLPHUS:
Stokely, focus!

---

## STOKELY:
Father! I am a man now. And this man's mind is decided!
I am going to Howard. To meet people like...

---

Mr. Baldwin

---

## JIMMY BALDWIN:
Without truth in our publications, we are all infected. It’s metaphysical cancer, boy. 

---

## STOKELY:
Cancer?  

---

## JIMMY BALDWIN:
That’s right. Now as a Black writer, I must in some way represent you. Now, you didn’t elect me and I didn’t ask for it, but here we are. 

---

Everything I write will in some way reflect you. I’ll make you a pledge. 

---

If you will promise your elder brother that you will never, ever accept any of the many derogatory, degrading, and reductive definitions that this society has ready for you...

---

I, Jimmy Baldwin, promise that in my writing and beyond, I will never betray you. 

---

## STOKELY:
As a boy in Trinidad, I saw kids come to school with no shoes while politicians got fat driving fancy cars. 

---

I urged my tante to try and vote them out. It never sit right with me, even then. 

---

## JIMMY BALDWIN:
“To be a Negro in this country and to be relatively conscious is to be in a state of rage almost, almost all of the time.” But don’t let it make you bitter. 

---

## STOKELY:
Ain’t gon’ let the white man’s cancer get me. I’m ready. For revolution. 

---

## ELLA BAKER: 
Ready for Revolution? Is that so? 

---

## STOKELY:
Yes, Miss Ella Baker. And that was some speech you just gave. “Bigger than a hamburger.” The things you share about the bus boycotts in Greensboro. 

---

The Southern Christian Leadership Conference, our beloved S.C.L.C., making it crystal clear that current sit-ins and other demonstrations are concerned with something much bigger than a hamburger or even a giant-sized Coke. 

---

Thank you. I want you to tell me everything you know. 

---

## ELLA BAKER:
You just heard my speech, son. What do you think is your greatest asset in this fight? 

---

## STOKELY:
My fellow students.  

---

## ELLA BAKER:
So you were listening. What do you think they might have to offer? 

---

## STOKELY:
I don’t know. I generally find myself loud and proud with all the ideas. 

---

## ELLA BAKER:
What do you think you might learn if you try listening more than speaking? 

---

## STOKELY:
That maybe they have more to contribute than I think? That in the well of their imaginations lies the very place I, no, we, can find answers? 

---

## ELLA BAKER:
Am I hearing you say that you are your greatest asset? Not the old folks, 

---

like me and my contemporaries, trying to co-opt your youth for old strategies that may or may not deliver. 

---

## STOKELY:
Is that what I said? 

---

## ELLA BAKER:
What do you think? 

---

## STOKELY:
I think you are good at questions that help me figure out my own answers. 

---

## ELLA BAKER:
So what is your answer?

---

## STOKELY:
To ask questions! Then gather our ideas! And organize. 

---

## ELLA BAKER:
You see that young lady over there?
What do you think is your next best step now? 

---

## STOKELY:
Hey. Wanna strategize?  

---

## DIANE NASH:
Already on it, brother. Organizing a collective of just us students. Want to join? 

---

## STOKELY:
I’m in. What should I call you? 

---

## DIANE NASH:
Nash. Diane Nash. Let’s move. 

---

## STOKELY:
What do we want?

---

## FREEDOM RIDERS:
Freedom! 

---

## STOKELY:
When do we want it?

---

## FREEDOM RIDERS:
Now!  

---

## STOKELY:
What do we want?

---

## FREEDOM RIDERS:
Justice! 

---

## STOKELY:
When do we want it?! 

---

## FREEDOM RIDERS:
Now! 

---

## STOKELY AND FREEDOM RIDERS:
Justice Now! Freedom Now! 
Justice Now! Freedom Now! 

---

## STOKELY:
When I was a kid my mum would make me sit in her church and watch the preacher preach and praise shout. 

---

And when I got a little older I’d stand on the corner of 125th and 7th in Harlem and watch the stepladder preachers get up there and screech their talk! 

---

Their walk! Preaching liberation! Teaching Black restoration! To a new generation! And here I stand! Two years later, still at Howard 

---

## A LADY FREEDOM RIDER:
Hey fresh chocolate! 

---

## STOKELY:
That’s right, Mama. I’m only nineteen- 

---

## A LADY FREEDOM RIDER:
Watch out now! 

---

## STOKELY:
Well hey, you are pretty cute yourself! 

---

Now I'm on break from Howard, but I am learning there that we cannot sit and wait. We got to anticipate! We cannot wait! I’m talking to you straight! We acted! 

---

We let go the bitter and turn it to sweet! We have taken the train from New Orleans to Jackson, Mississippi and they tried to stop us! 

---

Tried to thwart us! Tried to ignore us! But here we stand, good people! And we did what we come here to do! 

---

That’s right! We integrated that train car! I say, we integrated that train car! 

---

Turn to the brother or sister next to you and pat yourselves on the back! 

---

And now that we are here, we are we going to sit at these lunch counters and have us a good meal for the good work we’ve done today, ain’t that right, ya’ll? I say ain’t that right?! 

---

Oh waiter? Waiter? Can you serve the brothers and sisters and the people at the lunch counter, please?! 

---

## MAY CHARLES:
Kwame, I don’t like this story now 

---

## STOKELY:
Yes! Laugh, good people! Keep on laughing! We gonna have joy all the way to freedom! Justice Now! Freedom Now! 

---

## MAY CHARLES:
I said I don’t like this story, Kwame! 

---

## STOKELY AND FREEDOM RIDERS:
Justice Now! Freedom Now! 
Justice Now! Freedom Now! 

---

## MAY CHARLES:
This story hurts! Stop! Stop-! 

---

[muffled cries and sounds of struggle]

## STOKELY:
Hey, what’s going on?! Hey, hey hey hey! Get your hands off that lady!  

---

## MAY CHARLES:
Stop! 

---

## STOKELY:
Take your hands off him, he’s just a kid! Get you hands off me! What are you doing?! You can’t-can’t-can’t-can’t-Hey-! Hey! Leggo my arm 

---

## MAY CHARLES:
STOP-! 

---

## STOKELY:
What are you going to do with that baton-! Officer! 

---


## MAY CHARLES & STOKELY:
Stop! 

---

[whooshing sound]

## MAY CHARLES:
No more stories about you in jail! 

---

It’s too painful, it’s too--- 

---

## KWAME TURE:
Ugly! And truth is ugly! 

---

## STOKELY (SINGING):
I'm gonna tell God how you treat me

---

## STOKELY:
Absolutely I’m goin to tell God how you treat me! 
Treat us! Locking us up in here like dogs! 

---

You make me come in here and stand before my brothers 

---

Naked, unclothed and shackled. 

---

You make us come in here, standing with wrist breakers on our arms until the pain is so unbearable 

---

That we have no choice but to flip our bodies, flip our resolve 

---

As you twist our arms like animals.

---

We stage a hunger strike. I don’t agree! 

---

But I do it because my brothers in Parchman need us to be one until, move as one force until we organize! 

---

We are nothing without organization! I was the last to eat!

---

And I vow I would never again allow my body to be broken down without nourishment of my own free will 

---

As the racists that hold the keys to this 6 by 8 foot hole that I share with another brother in the struggle try to break my soul. 

---

Cry out, brothers! I hear you brothers! 

---

They try to divide us and conquer us! But they cannot conquer us! 

---

This is akin to Middle Passage! 
The adage as savage! 
They stack us, attack us 

---

But they cannot bust us. 
We cannot trust thus 

---

That due process will free us, due process will retrieve us 

---

Back to the land of the living, giving us life 

---

You have had me in here for almost 49 days! 

---

49 days in this dank, stank 6 by 8 cell tank! I rank up high 

---

But I ain’t seent no sunlight since 49 days! You think you can break us? I don’t need more than a shower a week. Yes, laugh! 

---

Don’t need food! Laugh harder! 

---

Nor do I need you to like me! Just need my song! 

---

My song my Tante Elaine used to sing when she get an attitude. Like the one I got right now! 

---

## STOKELY (SINGING):
I'm gonna tell God how you treat me

---

## STOKELY:
Sing with me, Freedom brothers and sisters! 

---

## STOKELY & FREEDOM FIGHTERS (SINGING):
I'm gonna tell God how you treat me one of these days, Hallelujah. I'm gonna tell God how you treat me

---

I'm gonna tell God how you treat me one of these days!

---

I'm gonna sit at the welcome table one of these days, Hallelujah

---

I'm gonna sit at the welcome table one of these days

---

I'm gonna tell God how you treat me one of these days, Hallelujah
 
---

## MAY CHARLES: 
Those guards in that jail could have killed you. 

---

## KWAME TURE:
But mother. I will die. I am dying.

---

## MAY CHARLES:
You will not die! Not like my sweet Adolphus!

---

## KWAME TURE
Just like your sweet Adolphus!

---

## ADOLPHUS (SINGING OFF-STAGE):
One glad morning

---

## MAY CHARLES:
I don't want to remember this!

---

## ADOLPHUS (SINGING OFF-STAGE):
When this life is over
I fly away to a place
Where joy will never end
I fly away, oh Lordie, I'll fly away

---

## MABEL:
Son, pay your respects to your father. 

---

Go on, son. 

---

I’ll walk with you, then 

---

## STOKELY:
No. 

---

## MABEL:
You will regret it, son 

---

## STOKELY:
I want to remember him, the way he was a week ago when I saw him last.

---

Bless you Father. I promise you, I will graduate.  

---

## MABEL:
Promise me something too, son. That you will never leave me. 

---

[recorder clicks]

## MAY CHARLES:
Why record when Adolphus' dies?

---

## KWAME TURE:
Never leave you?

---

## MAY CHARLES:
How could so much pain ever help anybody?

---

## KWAME TURE:
Never leave you?

---

## MAY CHARLES:
Unclinch your fists, son! Who are you fighting?

---

## KWAME TURE:
The government. The doctors. You. 

---

## MAY CHARLES:
Me? Why fighting me? 

---

## KWAME TURE:
You owe me. 

---

## MAY CHARLES:
Owe you? For what?

---

## KWAME TURE:
I don't remember!

---

## MAY CHARLES:
You are not making sense.

---

## KWAME TURE:
This isn't chemo speaking, Mom.

---

## MAY CHARLES:
Then what is? What are you doing now?

---

## STOKELY:
I hate b-b-b-b-itter!

---

## TANTE ELAINE:
Don't disrespect, Stokely.

---

## STOKELY:
What, Tante? Where's mother!

---

## TANTE ELAINE:
You keep asking me the same question and what is my answer every time? Your mum is gone to America

---

## STOKELY:
But why?

---

## TANTE ELAINE:
Stokely!

---

## STOKELY:
Why?

---

## KWAME TURE:
And then Tante Elaine, she, she, she tells me

---

## MAY CHARLES:
She tells you what?

---

## TANTE ELAINE:
Don't you 'member, boy? You were there!

---

## KWAME TURE:
I was there. I was there!

---

## MAY CHARLES:
You was where?

---

## TANTE ELAINE:
Right after you have a big breathing attack-

---

## KWAME TURE:
Right after my last big asthma attack-

---

## TANTE ELAINE:
You overhear, boy.

---

## KWAME TURE:
I overhear.

---

## MAY CHARLES:
Overhear what? Overhear what?

---

## CECELIA:
Whassa matta? Where's the cat with your tongue, May Charles?

---

## MABEL:
I'm moving.

---

## CECLIA:
To where?

---

## MABEL:
New York, the Bronx.

---

## CECELIA:
And what of my son?

---

## MABEL:
Adolphus will come with me

---

## CECELIA:
You mean you give him an ultimatum.

---

## MABEL:
Later. He will come later. After I find us a place.

---

## CECELIA:
You and the children all alone in America?

---

## MABEL:
I will send for the children.

---

## CECELIA:
Send for them? You mean leave them here? With me? When will you send for them? When?

---

## MABEL:
When I am a better mother like you say I should be!

---

## STOKELY:
Ma, where are you going, Ma! Don't leave me! Don't leave me here alone!

---

## KWAME TURE:
You left me!

---

## MAY CHARLES:
Erase that tape!

---

## KWAME TURE:
Me, Umilta and Baby Lynette. In Trinidad. 

---

## MAY CHARLES:
I went to America! I didn't leave you. But of course that's what that Tante Elaine would have you believe.
Gimme the recorder!

---

## KWAME TURE:
No! You didn't even say goodbye. 

---

## MAY CHARLES:
I’m here now. 

---

## KWAME TURE:
And now you wish to leave my papers scattered everywhere? 

---

## MAY CHARLES:
I am here now!

---

## KWAME TURE:
Grandmother and Tante questioned your mothering, but leaving seems to be the thing you are pretty good at. Your love hurts. Literally.  

---

## MAY CHARLES:
Then you don’t need me at all then, son. Do you? 

---

## KWAME TURE:
If you do not do what I need you to do, then...no. 

---

Wait.

---

[drums crescendo]

B-b-b-b-bitter.
Bitter, bitter.

---

## CECELIA
Grandmother is here. Match my breath. Don't be scared.

---

Grandmother's got you. Breath with me.

---

That's it, child. That's it. I told Tante Elaine what herbs to get you.
She mixin' my recipe up special just for you

---

Gonna mix it bitter like you don't like.
But bitter heals you, son.

Make you strong.
Bitter like life.

## KWAME TURE:

## CECELIA:

## KWAME TURE:
Why is she leaving me?

## CECELIA:
Shhh, hush, boy. Hush.

## CECELIA:

## KWAME TURE:

## GLORIA RICHARDSON:
Speak up, son. What can your voice do for the people of Cambridge? 

---

## STOKELY:
Governor Wallace is campaigning here, Mrs. Richardson. You need young folks trained to organize. 

---

## GLORIA RICHARDSON:
Cambridge ain’t Mississippi, son, especially for us Blacks. 

---

## STOKELY:
Don’t you mean "negro" or “coloreds?” 

---

## GLORIA RICHARDSON:
“Coloreds?” What? Like we crayolas? 

---

## STOKELY:
My Tante Elaine says black is bad. 

---

## GLORIA RICHARDSON:
I am Black. Do you think I am bad? 

---

## STOKELY:
No Ma’am.

## GLORIA RICHARDSON:

You, Mrs. Richardson, are like Superman! But a lady. Powerful

B-b-b-b-b- 

---

[knock]
 
---

## KWAME TURE:
Ready for Revolution. 

---

## MAY CHARLES:
Here.

---

## KWAME TURE:
What's this? 

---

## MAY CHARLES:
From the open air marketplace down the road.

---

## KWAME TURE:
Ginger? Honey? Pepto bismol? 

---

## MAY CHARLES:
Ah chuts! Forgot apple cider vinegar-

---

## KWAME TURE:
What's this for?

---

A Bible?

---

A crucifix?

---

Holy water?

---

Ah! What are you doing?

---

## MAY CHARLES:
Saving you!

---

## KWAME TURE:
It's lonely to be dying. It's even lonelier when people closest to you deny you're dying. 

---

## MAY CHARLES:
Here's some more holy water-

---

## KWAME TURE:
Stop it, Ma!

---

## MAY CHARLES:
What?

---

## KWAME TURE:
Are you ready for revolution?

---

## MAY CHARLES:
Do you want me to find apple cider vinegar or no?

---

## KWAME TURE:
Ready for revolution. Ready for revolution.
Say it, Ma.

---

## MAY CHARLES:
Fresh lemons?

---

## KWAME TURE:
Why won't you listen to me?

---

## MAY CHARLES:
You won't listen to me.

---

## KWAME TURE:
Talk to me!

---

## MAY CHARLES:
I don't want to talk!

---

## KWAME TURE:
Then why did you come back!

---

## MAY CHARLES:
Told you to Pepto.

---

## KWAME TURE:
Me throat.

---

## MAY CHARLES:
Ginger.

---

## KWAME TURE:
I'm tired.

---

## MAY CHARLES:
Sleep!

---

## KWAME TURE:
Ma! What I have can't be fixed with a nap

---

## MAY CHARLES:
Gettin' old ain't for softies

---

## KWAME TURE:
I will not get old. Pepto can't fix this

---

## MAY CHARLES:
What pepto can't, laughter can.

---

## KWAME TURE:
Ma-

---

## MAY CHARLES:
I get a sniffle. I laugh. Body aches? I laugh harder.

---

## KWAME TURE:
Why don't you try to understand?

---

## MAY CHARLES:
Do I stutter, boy?

---

[off-stage laughter]

## KWAME TURE:
All that laughter! Laughter!

---

## STOKELY:
You brothers want to get a drink? We at the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee need to blow off some steam!

---

S.N.C.C. needs to blow off steam! Baby! A Trinidadian blows off steam by getting on a boat. Get it? Getting on a boat?

---

Oh, and the ladies, you know how they blow off steam? Laying low cause the position of women in S.N.C.C. is prone! 

---

## MAY CHARLES:
Prone? Uh oh.

---

[phone rings]

---

## STOKELY:
Hello?

---

## DIANE NASH:
“Prone?” 

---

## STOKELY:
Nash! Hello! Miss you at S.N.C.C. Will you pop in soon to say hey?

---

## DIANE NASH:
“Prone?” 

---

## KWAME TURE:
Yes. Prone, to lie flat, especially facing downward 

---

## DIANE NASH:
I know what it means, Stokely. 

---

## KWAME TURE:
Good joke, huh? 

---

## DIANE NASH:
It’s vulgar. 

---

## STOKELY:
I was joking! 

---

## DIANE NASH:
It’s disrespectful 

---

## STOKELY:
I whisper this line, everyone in earshot all burst out laughing! 

---

Like it’s the hardest laugh they ever did have in their lives. Even John Lewis!  

---

## DIANE NASH:
Yes. Fay told me. She says she even checked you at the time.

---

## STOKELY:
Yes, Miss Bellamy did.

---

## DIANE NASH:
She told me she also asked you where would this movement be without her? Mrs. Baker? Mrs. Richardson? 

---

Me? Ever try to build anything or solve a problem with a man? It takes a long time 

---

## KWAME TURE:
Nash 

---

## DIANE NASH:
It takes forever. 

---

## KWAME TURE:
Nash! 

---

## DIANE NASH:
S.N.C.C. was literally built on our backs! But I guess that couldn’t have happened unless we were laying flat. Right Stokely? 

---

## MAY CHARLES:
She told you!

---

## KWAME TURE:
This is funny? 

---

Okay, Ma! That’s enough 

---

Enough! Those ladies made me! And this is not funny, it's a cautionary tale, it was a- 

---

## DIANE NASH:
Misstep. I know it was a misstep.

---

## STOKELY:
Yes.

---

## DIANE NASH:
And I know your heart. Fannie Lou. Gloria. The others. We all know.
You done more for women in the movement than anybody.

---

## STOKELY:
I try my best.

---

## DIANE NASH:
And hopefully history remembers that instead of this. Just watch that damn motor mouth, Stokes. Okay?

---

## MAY CHARLES:
Motor mouth. She got that right.

---

## KWAME TURE:
Why don't you try to understand?

---

## MAY CHARLES:
I understand. More than you.

---

## KWAME TURE:
Then you are right.

---

## MAY CHARLES:
Ah! Now you understand.

---

## KWAME TURE:
Maybe you are a bad mother.

---

Forgive me. I didn't mean to-

---

Hello. Earth to May. Earth to May-- 

---

Knock knock. Whose there. You. You who? You who I need you to accept my apology, mother. Hello? Hello? 


---

[whoosh]

## STOKELY:
I say hello. My name is Stokely Carmichael. Are you a registered voter?

---

[door slam]

Hey hey hey! I’m Stokely Carmichael. Are you a registered voter? 

---

[door slam]

Knock Knock. Who is there. You. You who? You who I need you to register to vote! 

---

Be part of the solution for Black people in Lowndes County. 

---

Yes, yes, sign up, sign up! We are going to make this change for our people! Vote for the picture of the Black Panther! 

---

[gunshot]

---

## FANNIE LOU HAMER:
You good, boy?

---

## STOKELY:
Miss Fannie...Sammy. 

---

A student. A Navy man. An organizer. My friend.... 

---

Organizing Blacks to go to Macon County courthouse to register to vote. 

---

They say he tries to use a “whites only” restroom. 

---

Shoot him right in the face, Miss Fannie. Right in the face... 

---

## FANNIE LOU HAMER:
You love him? 

---

What I tell you befo’?  

---

## STOKELY:
“Gon’ be a lot of folks we love goin to glory if we gon’ win. Steel yourself now, boy. ” 

---

## FANNIE LOU HAMER:
So what you gon’ do wit yo’ pain? 

---

## STOKELY:
...Organize. 

---

Comrades! My friend and brother Sammy Younge Jr. is no more.
We insist the people hear his name!

---

Say his name! Sammy Younge!

---

## CROWD:
Sammy Younge!

---

## STOKELY:
So as we call up the name of our fallen brother, let us call in the name of a new chairman of S.N.C.C to replace our brother John Lewis who has resigned to pursue different ideologies. 

---

I, me, Stokely Carmichael humbly accept the position as the new chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, affectionately known as S.N.C.C. 

---

## DR. KING:
Mr. Carmichael. 

---

## STOKELY:
Dr. King. “Da Lawd.” 

---

## DR. KING:
Excuse me? 

---

## STOKELY:
Forgive me. I revere you. 

---

## DR. KING:
Okay. Well. As a leader of S.N.C.C. we need you. 

---

## STOKELY:
For? 

---

## DR. KING:
James Meredith has been shot. 

---

He’s still with us.  

---

## STOKELY:
Thank God. Trying to kill a man for integrating a university- ! 

---

## DR. KING:
Well it is Mississippi. 

---

## STOKELY:
What can S.N.C.C. do? 

---

## DR. KING:
We are gathering our collectives to finish the trek he started. A March Against Fear. 

---

## STOKELY:
We are in. 

---

## DR. KING:
Don’t you need to consult with your cohort? 

---

## STOKELY:
To march with Da Lawd? We are in, good doctor. Let’s march! 

---
[explosions, voices, and sirens]

---

## STOKELY:
They got Sammy Younge! They got me in Parchman and Cambridge!

---

They try to get me in Lowndes County! But they ain’t gon’ to get me here in Greenwood, Mississippi! 

---

Stop holding me back, Dr. King! They want a piece of me! I will give them a piece of me!

---

And I will get a piece of them! Now let me go!

---

## KWAME TURE:
See, Ma. I'm in trouble. Again.

---

You don't like when I'm in trouble.

---

Cat still got yo' tongue?

---

Okay, then.

---

[explosions, voices, and sirens]

---

## STOKELY:
They got Sammy Younge! They got me in Parchman and Cambridge! They try to get me in Lowndes County! 

---

But they ain’t gon’ to get me here in Greenwood, Mississippi! 

---

Stop holding me back, Dr. King! They want a piece of me! TOP HOLDING ME BACK, DR. KING! THEY WANT A PIECE OF ME! I WILL GIVE THEM A PIECE OF ME! AND I WILL GET A PIECE OF THEM! NOW LET ME GO! 

---

## KWAME TURE:
Ma!I know you want to say something-  

---

I'm sorry. Truly. Will you forgive me? Please. Please?

---

Your silence is power.
Power.

---

## STOKELY:
BLACK POWER! BLACK POWER! BLACK POWER!

---

An unforunate slogan?

---

## DR. KING:
It gives the wrong connotation.  

---

## STOKELY:
Connotation?  

---

## DR. KING:
On unsophisticated ears it means “Get Whitey.” 

---

## STOKELY:
And on sophisticated ears? 

---

## DR. KING:
The amassing of political and economic power. 

---

## STOKELY:
So you do understand! 

---

## DR. KING:
Absolutely. 

---

## STOKELY:
I used you, you know. For a national platform. We planned to drop that phrase. And it lit things on fire. 

---

## DR. KING:
I’ve been used before. One more time won’t hurt.  

---

## STOKELY:
Then what about this war in Vietnam. 

---

## DR. KING:
Lawd, today. 

---

## STOKELY:
You have quite the sense of humor, good doctor. 

---

## DR. KING:
Best kept secret of the movement, my friend. Go on. 

---

## STOKELY:
Right now the people are following you because you are “Da...”Ahem. 

---

## DR. KING:
Uh hm. 

---

## STOKELY:
You are our unofficial Christ. 

---

## DR. KING:
I’m a servant of Christ. 

---

## STOKELY:
A servant who hasn’t taken a stance on this illegal and morally corrupt war. Do you not understand that the war is part of our fight for Civil Rights? 

---

## DR. KING:
Of course I do. 

---

## STOKELY:
Then why stay silent? 

---

## DR. KING:
Step by step, Stokely. 

---

## STOKELY:
“Step by step” killed Sammy Younge, Jr. 

---

## DR. KING:
Very unfortunate loss.  

---

## STOKELY:
Unfortunate? He wasn’t a number! He was my brother! 

---

## DR. KING:
I’m sorry. 

---

## STOKELY:
What’s sorry is your refusal to take a stand. Brothers all over are being drafted to fight for rights for people in another country when they do not have those basic rights at home! 

---

They are telling our brothers to go over there and kill people while we are being slaughtered in a country we built brick by brick. 

---

## DR. KING:
These things take time, Stokely. 

---

## STOKELY:
The time is now. You cannot claim to fight injustice and be silent in the face of such injustice. 

---

## DR. KING:
You question my methods? 

---

## STOKELY:
Take a stand! Say NO to the war in Vietnam. Say it King, like my father tell me when I refuse to go to Harvard. HELL NO WE WON’T GO!
 
---

## STOKELY:
They think I make decisions without them, they think I am a one man show. Stokely “Star michael!” They say. 

---

But I am not. I just want to serve the people. It’s been a hard ass year, jack. Too hard. 

---

And so, I am stepping down as Chairman of S.N.C.C.  

---

## STOKELY:
...And humbly accepting being an honorary chairman of the Black Panther Party...If our people can all just work together. 

---

If I can just get S.N.C.C. to work together with the Black Panthers, we can do far more together than operating as separate and equal. S.N.C.C. and Black Panthers together, “we shall not be moved!” 

---

Death threats won't stop me!

---

## MAY CHARLES:
Death threats?

---

## KWAME TURE:
At last she speaks! 

---

You okay?

---

## MAY CHARLES:
Why wouldn't I be okay?

---

## KWAME TURE:
I didn't mean to-

---

## MAY CHARLES:
Eh eh. It's what you and the people need, right?

---

## KWAME TURE:
Yeah.

---

Wait. Who is this supportive and compliant person?

---

## MAY CHARLES:
A good mother. Who knows what you need.

---


## JOCKO (ON RADIO) 
Eat the yock
This is the Jock 

---


Back on the scene 
With mah record machine

---


Saying ooh bop a doo 
How do ye doo


---

## STOKELY:
My goodness. This...this...is beautiful! Dance with me!

---

This is the most exquisite, most beautiful voice I have ever heard! Keep dancing with me!

---

## JOCKO (V.O.) :
That was the glorious Miriam Makeba-

---

## STOKELY:
Miriam Makeba?

---

## JOCKO (V.O.):
From South Africa

---

## STOKELY:
South Africa... 

---

## JOCKO (V.O.):
She. The voice of a new generation. 

---

## STOKELY:
Mother...I’m going to marry Miss Miriam Makeba!  

---

## STOKELY:
Miss Miriam. That was an exceptional performance. Your voice is like silk against my soul.

---

## MIRIAM MAKEBA:
Okay.

---

## STOKELY:
Except silk against isn't the right word. Because your silk is one with my soul.

---

## MIRIAM MAKEBA:
Well, I really must be going-


---

## STOKELY:
Your eyes. They are exquisite. 

---

A cab uptown?

---

## MIRIAM MAKEBA:
...What did you say your name is again?

---

## KWAME TURE:
Miriam. Oh Miriam...

---

## MAY CHARLES:
Your eyes look brighter, son.

---

## KWAME TURE:
She was Black perfection.

---

## MAY CHARLES:
And you were perfect. In love.

---

## MIRIAM MAKEBA:
Luggage! Stokely! My flight leaves in thirty minutes to Montreux. How are you going to get
all my luggage to the airport? 

---

## MIRIAM MAKEBA:
Stokely? What are you doing? We have to go- 

---

## STOKELY:
See that long line of white men in their cars? 

---

## MIRIAM MAKEBA:
Who are they?

---

## STOKELY:
The FBI surveilling me... watch this.

---

## MIRIAM MAKEBA:
What! Don’t do that! They will think you have a gun! 

---

## STOKELY:
Because I am that violent Stokely Carmichael who the New York Times says is the second coming of Malcolm X! 

---

## MIRIAM MAKEBA:
This isn’t funny. We have to go. Now! 

---

## MIRIAM MAKEBA:
Stokely! What are you doing?! 

---

## STOKELY:
Getting you to the airport. 

---

## MIRIAM MAKEBA:
Here they come... to take my bags?
You rascal.

---

## STOKELY:
And while we wait...

---

## STOKELY:
Zenzi, may I have this dance? 

---

## MIRIAM MAKEBA:
Silly man. Don’t step on my feet. 

---

## STOKELY:
Let’s get married. 

---

## MIRIAM MAKEBA:
What? 

---

...Ok. 

---

## MAY CHARLES:
You are glowing! 

---

## KWAME TURE:
It’s the chemo. 

---

## MAY CHARLES:
It’s love. 

---

## KWAME TURE:
But our love costs. 

---

## MIRIAM MAKEBA:
That was my manager. News of our union has hit the press. My shows are canceled. 

---

## STOKELY:
All of them? 

---

## MIRIAM MAKEBA:
All of them. 

---

## STOKELY:
...Zenzi. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.

---

## KWAME TURE:
They ban her music! 
They throw her records out of windows. 
Smash her beautiful perfect voice to the ground! 

---

## MAY CHARLES:
Feel it. Feel it all. 

---

## KWAME TURE:
I am a machine! 
Machines do not feel! 

---


They just produce! 
Well I am going to produce 
These recordings 

---


And you will agree to the institute. 
These are the only things keeping me alive now! 
Feeling doesn’t stop pain- 

---

[gunshots]

---

## KWAME TURE:
Ah chuts! 

---

## MAY CHARLES:
What now? 

---

## REPORTER ONE:
Mr. Carmichael, are you declaring war on white America?

---

## STOKELY:
...When white America killed Dr. King she declared war on us! 

---

The rebellions that have been occurring around these cities and this country is just light stuff to what is about to happen. 

---

Black people know that they have to get guns. 
Next question.

---

## REPORTER TWO :
Do you fear for your life? 

---

## STOKELY:
The Hell with my life! You should fear for yours. I know I’m going to die! 

---

## KWAME TURE:
The pain! Hurts! Everywhere! Running out of time!

---

## STOKELY:
I am not a snitch! An informant! The government is bad-jacketing me to divide and conquer Black people! 

---

Because I still work with S.N.C.C. and The Panthers! It’s all lies! 
Lies! 

---

Yes, I will fly to Cuba to meet with Fidel. 

---

Death threats?! You threaten my life! The life of my wife! My family! 

---

Miriam, pack your things! We got to get the hell outta here. 

---

Hello, Guinea. 

---

Mr. Sekou Toure. I am your humble student. 

---

Mr. Kwame Nkrumah. I am at your service. 

---

Yes, all white people should leave S.N.C.C.! That’s right! We don’t need whites to liberate us! They need to liberate their own brothers if they want to help us! 

---

Dear Black Panther Party. I am of the opinion that the milk in your chocolate is diluting the power of the party. And with that, I no longer wish to be affiliated with you. 

---

Yes, I will come to Barbados to speak. 

---

Yes, I will come to Oakland to sign books. 

---

Here is my latest publication, Stokely Speaks. Whose name should I sign it to? 

---

Where do I sign? Ah, right here...I am officially now...Kwame Ture! 

---

[sirens]

---

## KWAME TURE:
GET YOUR HAND OFF ME! YOU CAN’T JAIL ME AGAIN! I AM NOT 
ATTEMPTING TO OVERTHROW THE GUINEAN GOVERNMENT JUST BECAUSE I CHANGE MY NAME!

---

I DON’T WANT TO BE IN JAIL ANYMORE! I WANT 
MOTHER! MOTHER! WHERE’S MY MOTHER---! 

---

## MAY CHARLES:
Kwame, you’re delirious- 

---

## KWAME TURE:
They call me sell out, traitor, say I disappear to Africa! I did not disappear!
I work! Full time! For 30 years.

---

Making Nkrumah's All African People's Revolutionary Party a force for liberation! Speaking! Organizing! All over the world!

---

## MAY CHARLES:
You're sweating, son.

---

## KWAME TURE:
They got Brother Malcolm! The good Docta King! Sammy Younge, Jr.!

---

But they didn't get me, Ma! Even through the government is killing me now with this cancer, they didn't get me!

---

I owe my fallen comrades! I owe the people! And so do you! The institute-

---

## MAY CHARLES:
Forget your institute! All you care about is the institute! 
What about me?

---

## KWAME TURE:
You? You owe me for leaving us! Where were you, Ma?

---

## MAY CHARLES:
Oh for God's sakes-

---

## KWAME TURE:
Stop it, Ma! Just stop! For once, don’t deny or avoid, just say it, say it, please---! 

---

## MAY CHARLES:
Why stay in Trinidad?! So your grandmother and tantes can repeatedly tell me how bad a mother I am? 
I was sick of the blatant disrespect! 

---

## KWAME TURE:
You left because you felt disrespected? 

---

## MAY CHARLES:
I left Trinidad to go back to New York to be with people who loved me, who understood 
me! 
To make a life! 

---

## KWAME TURE:
We were your life! 

---

## MAY CHARLES:
I am so much more than just a mother. 

---

## KWAME TURE:
You left your only son. And took his father out the house to be with you in America. 

---

## MAY CHARLES:
I begged your father to bring you and your sisters to the states long before your 
Grandmother Cecelia went to God. 
Begged! 

---

## KWAME TURE:
But he didn’t. He stayed with you. 

---

## MAY CHARLES:
I sent packages. Father sent suits for you- 

---

## KWAME TURE:
It wasn’t enough- 

---

## MAY CHARLES:
It’s all we had! 

---

## KWAME TURE:
I wasn’t enough! 

---

## MAY CHARLES:
Really son?

---

## KWAME TURE:
I built myself. Built charisma. Charm. And brilliance.

---

So people would like me. Love me.
So no one would leave me again. 

---

## MAY CHARLES:
Leave you? How dare you be so thoughtless, so selfish 

---

## KWAME TURE:
Selfish?

---

## MAY CHARLES:
I am losing my son! 

---

## KWAME TURE:
At last! You admit I am going to die! 

---

## MAY CHARLES:
I birth you! You! You think every night I didn’t pray to God to protect you? 

---

Think I didn’t call all your tantes, collect, which pissed them off, to learn when you try to make Tante Elaine vote, or skinned your knee on the playground, or lose a tooth? 

---

You were my son. Your eyes open, I see my Daddy's eyes.
Your first smile if my Granddaddy's...your quick wit is that old biddy, Grandmother Cecelia's. She ain't like me one bit, but she loved you. More than life itself.

---

Yes, it was seven, almost eight years I was gone. But I never slept! Barely ate! Worked my tail off to bring you and your sisters to America!

---

It cost me guilt. Tears. Shame.

---

As your little hands clutch onto my legs screaming, "Mother, mother, please don't leave me." But please don't leave me. Please don't die, son. DOn't die. Don't leave me alone.

---

## MAY CHARLES:
Son, what’s wrong-- 

---

## KWAME TURE:
Are you happy now-? 

---

## MAY CHARLES:
I’m calling someone- 

---

## KWAME TURE:
All I am is feeling-- 

---

## MAY CHARLES:
Where’s your phone- 

---

## KWAME TURE:
I’m not a machine-- 

---

## MAY CHARLES:
Hold tight, help is coming-- 

---

## KWAME TURE:
I’m a man, just a man-- 

---

## MAY CHARLES:
Breathe, son! 

---

## ADOLPHUS:
He’s tryin! 

---

## MAY CHARLES:
Slow your breaths... 
Try harder! 

---

## CECELIA:
Yell at the boy?! 

---

## MAY CHARLES:
I know how to mother! 

---

## TANTE ELAINE:
Yellin’ ain’t motherin’! 

---

## MAY CHARLES:
What is then? 

---

## CECELIA:
Pray over him. 
Love him with all you got. 
Then let go. 

---

## ADOLPHUS:
Let go. 

---

## TANTE ELAINE:
Let go. 

---

## MAY CHARLES:
Kwame, match my breath, son- 
Don’t be scared- 
Mother’s got you- 
Breathe with me. 

---


That’s it, son. That’s it. 
Tante Elaine is getting herbs- 
She mixin’ em up special just for you- 
Gonna mix it bitter like you don’t like- 

---

But bitter heals you, son. 
Make you strong- 
Bitter. ...Like life. 
Bitter life make you strong. 

---

## KWAME TURE:
B-b-b- 

---

## MAY CHARLES:
Breathe, son. 
Breathe. 

---

## KWAME TURE:
B--b-b-b-b-b--! 

---

## MAY CHARLES:
Good! Good, son! 
Now give me the bitter. 

---

So I can breathe it away. 
All the hurts. 

---

All the pain. 
All the sorrow 
Of being born Black 
And strong. 

---

Tell Grandmother Cecelia hello 
Greet your comrades who’ve fallen. 
My beautiful Adolphus. 

---

All them you’ve loved. 
And lost. 

---

Take your humanity with you 
And leave the bitter here with me. 
So you don’t take it with you to eternity. 

---

I have loved you best I could- 
Stokely Standiford Churchill “Great Man” Carmichael 
Kwame Ture 

---

You are the smartest most beautiful boy, no, man, in the world.
 
---

So now go get your rest.

---

## KWAME TURE:
But I don't want to leave you.

---

## MAY CHARLES:
Go.

---

...Ready. ...For Revolution. 

---

## STOKELY:
Well comrades, I just get out of jail. Again. ...Yes, laugh! It’s laughable! 

---

They arrest me while I march for the March Against Fear! They arrest me and try to stop us from registering Black people to vote. 

---

They arrest us again and again and again because they 
think we will not fight back! 

---

And I ask you! What sense does that make! You cannot be 
non-violent with someone who won’t be non-violent with you! That is nonsense! 
Illogical! 

---

A sheep being lead to slaughter! By the time you turn your cheek you are dead!
What good is a dead freedom fighter? He is no good! 

---

She is no good, I tell you that, Sweets! What we need is voting rights! 

---

What we need is control over our communities!

What we need is to stand up for our economics! 

---

For schools with adequate education for 
our children! 

---

For the right to breathe without a knee on our necks! 

---

And the next time the white man try to tell you to be quiet and docile and accept his nonsense, that you cannot vote, that you cannot eat, that you cannot work, that you cannot have equality! 

---

You tell him what we got to start saying now is Black Power! Black Power!

## CROWD:
Black Power!
