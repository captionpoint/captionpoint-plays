# Growing TPD
  - everyone voicing concerns/challenges/issues 
  - hear everyone's perspectives on how TPD is going 
  - where we want to be in a year

---

# Our Shows

---

## Bud & Herb
- an award-winning show that we're all proud of
- the highest quality show we have on the channel
- takes a larger amount of time and energy and thought

---

## ADHd20
- the lowest lift of all the shows: "winging it, casual-like"
- free and extremely important therapy for AK & Matt
- in 2025, we're branching out to guests of all brains, ND or no

---

## TPDL
- we're still getting there with the concept
- using pieces of it for shorts when it makes sense
- want to try to keep it from being a heavier lift

---

## TPD Produced
*amounts to the actual growth of the channel, but the most difficult lift for all*
### Stars and Wishes:
- find ways to make find all the "smarter vs. harder" elements
- i.e. "roll for mocktail" and "nekkid BG3" and "cooking with Bud and Herb"
- Ask an Artificer, deep diving into tech and games
- Actual Play that, depending on the situation can either be

# Shared Goals vs. Personal Goals

---

## we're (all) currently trying to keep up with:
  2 podcasts
  the weekly livestream
  a Patreon
    with an original one-shot each month & running 2 weekends & 
    an ongoing campaign that we're thinking about expanding to twice/month
  Social Media
    Patreon
    Discord
    Instagram/TikTok/YouTube
  other produced content that actively grows the channel
  spicy brains and home life and other interests and dumb old pets that are always going to the vet


  _And our fucking day jobs_

---

## Q: Where do we see TPD by End of the Year? What do we all Want? Do we share some, or all of these goals? 

### A: (no wrong answers)


---

# Real Talk:

## Feels to ü§ì like we are not on the same üöÄ

---

## Alison is trying to grow the channel in the way that she believes it needs to
- consistent weekly releases
- much community management
- focus on the content that brings numbers
- getting the job done as well as we can, knowing that the next release will be better

---

## Evan and Fitz are creating art
- beautifully crafted story and worldbuilding
- "will not release unless agreed to be perfect"
- the "waterfall method": create all episodes, release in bulk

---

## Matt is somewhere in-between 
*‚Ä¶and struggling as per uszh with a lack of priority and focus*
- knows that what has brought people to The Pocket Dimension is neither Bud & Herb OR ADHd20
- focusing on creating original content with a more stereotypical "YouTube formula", *along with*
- fostering Patrons and Patron Games and selling merch

*will benefit everyone more in the long run*


---

# We don't have a strategy, or we aren't *agreeing* on a strategy?

---

## we need to find a way to make it work better
- games are built with players in mind, but there are cancellations
- feedback is very slow on completed videos, or is never received
- meetings happen where people need to multitask; information isn't properly portrayed
- there is a lot of "this doesn't work for me", but less "let me work on it so that it does work for me"

---

# Possible Solutions?

---

## finding a system or structure that will help with this
- we chose clickup because I didn't get feedback on Notion and I felt that I couldn't make it work for all of us
- Clickup is not a dealbreaker‚Ä¶but I cannot guess how you best work, because we do not work the same way

---

## no matter what we have to have input/feedback
- at the very very least, a shared calendar
- full-on, rock solid, no guesswork Content Calendar


---

## We Elect an Admin‚Ä¶or Game Master?
- one person to control the flow of information and stuff
- all videos, Instagram posts, etc. will go to the Calendar first
- if a calendar is set a certain way one week, it can be changed‚Ä¶with enough prior knowledge
- but there cannot be changes made without Admin's approval

---

*ed: ask Alison about changing this for various Stories on IG and elsewhere?*

---

# Thoughts?

---

## AK and I are willing to take on the Project Mgmt and Scheduling of TPD's entire output
- this includes ADHd20, of course, the lowest lift at this point
- but more importantly: TPDL and other new produced content
- this also includes fitting in Bud & Herb into the schedule

---


## We want to Utilize the members of our Community
we talk about them all the time anyway, they truly are talented and fun: ttrpg players, video editors, both ttrpg AND video game designers, writers, etc.

---


## more guest GMs for Patron games
- Bladebound, Kai, Seth, etc. to run them and get paid
- if one of the Hottie Hive GM, they get paid similarly (if possible)

---


## more collabs (at our level)
- ADHDM, Corkboards & Curiosities, Deficient Master, etc.

---

## take our Strengths (above) and find a workable, fluid schedule that fits our lives and the way our brains work

---

1. everyone is always invited, but no longer required to participate if time does not permit

---

2. find ways to take away the guilt/stress/overbooking

---

3. make games less dependent on each others' schedules

- anyone can be an Ashley if they have to be
- Patron games, even campaigns, can be built without needing everyone present

---

## work on what everyone does best, delegate the rest
make this thing as FUN and as light as we can make it and still get to the point where we can have dinner with Brendan and Abria and Matt some day.
