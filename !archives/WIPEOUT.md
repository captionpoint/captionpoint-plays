## WYNN:
This dang thing is too tight.


## CLAUDIA:
He should be here by now.

---

## WYNN:
I can’t feel my legs.

---

## CLAUDIA:
He said it would start at eleven o’clock and it is currently eleven-oh-seven.

---

## WYNN:
Am I sincerely expected to be able to move in this?

---

## CLAUDIA:
(checking her watch) No.

---

No, wait.

---

## WYNN:
I can barely breathe in this godforsaken contraption.

---

Fuck.

---

## CLAUDIA:
Okay.

---

Now.

---

Now it is eleven-oh-seven.

---

## WYNN:
My nose is burning. 

---

## CLAUDIA:
Did you put on sunscreen?

---

## WYNN:
Of course I put on sunscreen, what do you think I am, some kind of hooligan that doesn’t put on sunscreen?

---
## CLAUDIA:
I never said you were a hooligan, I just want to make sure that you put on sunscreen.

---

## WYNN:
I bought the bottle that says SPF 90, okay?

---

It said it right on the bottle, up to four hours of protection, but that is a bald-faced lie because I can feel my nose burning as I speak.

---

## CLAUDIA:
I never said you were a hooligan.

---

## WYNN:
YOU GO TO HELL COPPERTONE BABY. 

---

## CLAUDIA:
Wynn, I never said you were a hooligan.

---

## WYNN:
I heard you the first time, would you stop goddamn attacking me?

---

## CLAUDIA:
I think the word “attack” is an exaggeration.


---

## CLAUDIA:
I think we would be a lot more productive right now if we used “I” statements.



---

## CLAUDIA:
I feel hurt when you don’t listen to me.

---

Now it’s your turn.


---

## CLAUDIA:
The way an “I” statement works is that -

---

## WYNN:
I KNOW WHAT AN “I” STATEMENT IS, CLAUDIA. 



---

## WYNN:
What are you looking at?

---

## CLAUDIA:
But you put on sunscreen right, Wynn?

---

## WYNN:
Oh my GOD.
---
## CLAUDIA:
Because it’s important!

---

And with climate change especially, and the ozone hole, we have to take care of ourselves, and sunscreen is a part of that, sunscreen is a way we can stay safe.

---

## WYNN:
If you say “sunscreen” one more time…

---

## CLAUDIA:
Elaine Vacek has 
[whispered]
skin cancer.

---

## WYNN:
Who? 

---

## CLAUDIA:
Elaine Vacek, from Pilates.

---

It’s one of those mole thingies, apparently.

---

I found a lump on my back a few months ago but the specialist said it was just an ingrown hair and that I should use something called a loofie to make the inflammation go down. 

---

## WYNN:
A what?

---

## CLAUDIA:
A loofie.

---

It’s a scrubby thing.

---

Georgie uses it in the bath sometimes.

---

## WYNN:
It’s pronounced loofah.

---

## CLAUDIA:
Yes, that’s what I said.

---

It’s worked wonders on my ingrown hair.

---

## WYNN:
(in her best Italian accent) Loofah. 


---

## CLAUDIA:
My mother had a lot of ingrown hair and she also had high blood pressure, which I now have because it’s passed genetically but also because I’m a Taurus which means I am very susceptible to stress.

---

## WYNN:
(no longer Italian) LOOFAH.

---

## CLAUDIA:
Gosh, it’s all very blue, isn’t it?

---

## CLAUDIA:
She’s doing a lot better, you know.

---

## WYNN:
Huzzah.

---

## CLAUDIA:
They put her on new medication, I think it’s really helping!

---

And there are all sorts of programs for people like her now, it’s so stimulating.

---

There’s a Paint-By-Numbers which she just adores, you know how creative she is.

---

## WYNN:
I think I would rather be force fed shampoo than Paint-by-Numbers. 

---

## CLAUDIA:
They focus on a different artist each week, it’s very well planned.

---

## WYNN:
I would rather choke on my own spit and die than Paint-by-Numbers.

---

## CLAUDIA:
I think it’s wonderful that she’s getting an opportunity to be artistically productive. 

---

## WYNN:
Well, aren’t you a fucking miracle.


---

## CLAUDIA:
It’s been a long time since the three of us were all together. 


---

## CLAUDIA:
Gosh, when was the last time?

---

Was it two years ago? 

---

## WYNN:
I don’t know. 

---

## CLAUDIA:
It was at the opera, wasn’t it?

---

“Die Zauberflöte.” 

---

## WYNN:
I don’t know.

---

## CLAUDIA:
Which would have been two years ago.

---

Or was it three? 

---

## WYNN:
I don’t know, Claudia.

---

I’m not a calendar.

---

## CLAUDIA:
She’s doing a lot better.

---

## WYNN:
You already said that.

---

## CLAUDIA:
Don’t you think it would be nice to see her again?

---

The three of us, all together, just like old times?

---

Don’t you think that would be nice? 

---

## WYNN:
No. 

---

## WYNN:
If this instructor doesn’t show up in the next ten seconds I am getting my ass out of this freezing hellhole and booking myself a massage.



---

## CLAUDIA:
THERE SHE IS!

---

Oh, thank goodness.

---

MARGARET!

---

GARY!

---

OVER HERE!

---

Look, can you see her?

---

 GARY!

---

Look, Wynn, it’s Gary!

---

GARY!

---

MARGARET!

---

## WYNN:
Claudia.

---

Claudia.

---

Claudia.

---

Claudia.

---

Claudia.

---

Claudia!

---

## CLAUDIA:
THIS WAY, GARY!

---

CAREFUL!

---

## WYNN:
What is she doing here?

---

## CLAUDIA:
YOU’RE ALMOST THERE, GARY!

---

## WYNN:
You said this was going to be just you and me!

---

## CLAUDIA:
KEEP GOING!

---

YOU’RE DOING GREAT! 
---
## WYNN:
Just you and me!

---

Your early birthday present, that’s what you said you wanted!

---

## CLAUDIA:
RIGHT HERE, GARY!

---

WE’RE RIGHT OVER HERE!

---

## GARY:
I SWEAR TO GOD I JUST SAW A DOLPHIN AND LADIES YOU GOTTA BELIEVE ME WHEN I TELL YOU THAT IT WINKED AT ME.

---

## CLAUDIA:
This is nice, isn’t it?

---

Don’t you think this is nice? 

---

## WYNN:
Claudia, I am going to kill you. 

---

## GARY:
HOT PIG IN A BLANKET IF IT ISN’T MY LITTLE WYNNIEBAGO!

---

Get over here, you glorious treasure, I haven’t seen you in ages and I want to give you a smoochy.

---

## CLAUDIA:
Did you remember to go to the bathroom? 

---

## GARY:
Air smoochies then, Wynn!

---

AIR SMOOCHIES!

---

GOD!

---

Look at us!

---

We look sexy!

---

Well, you two look sexy, I look like a walrus on one of those keto diets but you gotta work with what you’ve got, ladies, even if what you’ve got is a post-menopausal paunch of a belly.

---

But you know what, I love it!

---

I love my paunch!

---

I love this board!

---

I love this sun!

---

Hang ten, baby!

---

I’m a surfer!

---

## CLAUDIA:
You put on sunscreen, right?

---

## GARY:
Hell no!

---

I want to get one of those sexy summer tans like Sofia Loren.

---

## CLAUDIA:
Gary!

---

You have to put on sunscreen or else you’ll get 
skin cancer.

---

## GARY:
You only get skin cancer if you think you’re going to get skin cancer.

---

## WYNN:
That is so true.

---

## CLAUDIA:
That is absolutely incorrect.

---

## CLAUDIA:
Elaine Vacek has
skin cancer.

---

## GARY:
Well, good for Elaine.  

---

## GARY:
OH MAMA!

---

## GARY:
Now are we going to catch some waves today, ladies, or are we going to sit around until we’ve decomposed into basic protein compounds? 

---

## CLAUDIA:
We have to wait for the instructor, remember I told you I hired an instructor?

---

## GARY:
Right, right.

---

Which one is he? 


---

## CLAUDIA:
He’s twelve minutes late.

---

No.

---

Nooooo.

---

## GARY:
Ooooh, would you just look at all these puppies!

---

Wooooooof! 

---

## CLAUDIA:
Thirteen!

---

Thirteen minutes.

---

## GARY:
We are in the presence of some Platonic forms here, ladies.

---

Oooh, Wynn, look at that one, with the mullet!

---

He’s just like – what’s his name, Pablo, Pinocchio, I always get your third and fourth husbands mixed up, Petruchio – 

---

## WYNN:
Pierce? 

---

## GARY:
Pierce!

---

What a great name for a man.

---

Direct.

---

Confident.

---

Robust.

---

## WYNN:
We’re getting a divorce. 

---

## GARY:
Flaccid.

---

Sniveling.

---

Lame.

---

## CLAUDIA:
What?

---

I didn’t know that.

---

## CLAUDIA:
Why didn’t you tell me that? 


---

## GARY:
I said this to you Claudia, remember, at the wedding, I said there is something off about that man.

---

Sure, he’s pleasant and he makes a mean mushroom risotto but there is something fundamentally off about him. 

---

## CLAUDIA:
Wynn, why didn’t you -

---

## WYNN:
And are you still seeing that Pamela person?

---

## GARY:
Oh hell no.

---

No, that pinto bean has left the taco.

---

She tried talking me into double dipping on hydrocodone and you know how sensitive my adrenal glands are.

---

No, ma’am.

---

I’ve upgraded to a newer model, and ladies, I think this one’s a keeper.

---

Her name is Anika.

---

Doesn’t that just sound gorgeous?

---

Anika.

---

That’s a toot straight outta Gabriel’s trumpet.

---

Ahhh-nika. 

---

## CLAUDIA:
She’s very kind.

---

## GARY:
And wait till you see the bazoombas that come with.



---

## CLAUDIA:
Margaret!

---

We are in public! 

---

## GARY:
Wow!

---

Would you just look at this place?

---

You know,  my whole life I wanted to be a surfer, ever since I was a little girl, but my mother couldn’t take the patchouli.

---

OH!

---

OH!

---

OH!

---

Did I ever tell you about the time I ran into Steven Paccetti on my way down to Santa Cruz, right after my mother’s funeral?

---

## WYNN:
Who’s Steven Paccetti? 

---

## CLAUDIA:
From high school, remember?

---

The geometry teacher’s son?

---

## GARY:
The kid who ate the lung during the fetal pig dissection.

---

## CLAUDIA:
The one who became a priest.

---

## WYNN:
Oh, that Steven. 

---

## GARY:
Yes, thank you, ladies, ahoy, we are on the same boat, let’s take off.

---

SO!

---

I’m in the Bug, driving down Highway One, with my mother’s ashes beside me, and I’m heading towards the Boardwalk because it was her dying wish to be sprinkled among the roller coasters, we all remember that crazy broad my mother.

---

ANYWAY, I’m driving - no!

---

I’m cruising!

---

Unlike Claudia here who drives at the pace of a menopausal snail.

---

## CLAUDIA:
I drive at the speed I feel safe driving. 

---

## WYNN:
You drive at forty miles an hour.

---

## CLAUDIA:
Automobiles are death machines. 

---

## GARY:
And I catch up to this truck which is crawling down the road, just crawling.

---

And you know I think tail-gaiting is a mortal sin, but I’m getting antsy!

---

I don’t like being in confined spaces with my mother, dead or alive.

---

So, I speed up.

---

I get close.

---

I’m inches away, ladies, inches, when WHAMMO!

---

The truck rounds a curve, slams the brakes, my Bug takes a nosedive, and me and my mother go flying SMACK into the windshield!

---

## CLAUDIA:
But you were wearing a seatbelt, right? 

---

## GARY:
So I pull over, and the truck pulls over, and guess who steps out of the passenger side?

---

## WYNN:
Steven - 

---

## GARY:
STEVEN PACCETTI, looking like God’s gift to the Jesuits!

---

So I say Steven!

---

Great to see you, honey!

---

Because it is!

---

I’m happy to see the little pater, it’s been a minute!

---

But Steve 
is blushing.

---

Something’s not right.

---

So I begin to pry.

---

I’m interested.

---

I’m a detective.

---

I’m Nancy Drew along the side of Highway One, hot on the Case of the Slammed Brakes, and just when I think I’ve got it all figured out, 

---

the driver’s door slooowly opens and this hunk steps out, and, ladies, I do mean hunk, with the muscles, and the jawline, and one of those collarbones you could just take a nap in, 

---

and I turn to Stevie to make a joke about archangels when I notice something on the side of Stevie’s face, some dangly 
white thing, 

---

like a glob of spit or something, and I’m about to point it out when all of a sudden my little grey cells kick in, everything falls into place, 

---

I see the light, and, LO, it is a shocker!

---

## WYNN:
What?

---

## GARY:
What, she says. 

---

## WYNN:
What! 

---

## GARY:
You think they were driving around to see the view?


---

## WYNN:
No!

---

## GARY:
Yes, my child. 

---

## WYNN:
No way!

---

## GARY:
Oh, all the way.

---

Father Steven was bestowing fellatio all the way down Highway One. 

---

## WYNN:
OH MY GOD!

---

## CLAUDIA:
OH MY GOSH!

---

## GARY:
RIGHT?

---

## CLAUDIA:
OH!

---

## WYNN:
THAT’S INCREDIBLE.

---

## CLAUDIA:
OH MY GOSH I’M PEEING. 

---

## WYNN:
God, that is so funny.

---

## CLAUDIA:
No, I’m actually peeing!

---

Sharks are attracted to the scent of urine, aren’t they? 

---

## WYNN:
That is so fucking funny!

---

## GARY:
What’s so funny?

---

## WYNN:
Steven Pacetti!

---

## GARY:
Oh!

---

Oh!

---

I have the absolute funniest story about Steven!

---

You’re not going to believe this.

---

So I’m cruising along Highway One, right, with my mother’s ashes beside me -  

---

## WYNN:
Oh my god.

---

## CLAUDIA:
Wynn.

---

## GARY:
When I notice this truck just crawling down the -

---

## WYNN:
Oh my god.

---

## CLAUDIA:
Wynn, be quiet.

---

## GARY:
What?

---

What’s wrong?

---

## CLAUDIA:
Nothing’s wrong.

---

Tell the story, sweetie.

---

You were on Highway One – 


---

## GARY:
I was on Highway One - 

---

## WYNN:
You said she was getting better. 

---

## CLAUDIA:
She is getting better. 

---

## GARY:
Who’s getting better?

---

## WYNN:
You call this better?

---

## GARY:
What are you talking about? 

---

## CLAUDIA:
Wow, look at that water, isn’t it nice to be out on the water?

---

## WYNN:
You call this better? 

---

## CLAUDIA:
ISN’T IT NICE?

---

Isn’t it nice to be together again, gosh, it’s so nice.

---

## BLAZE:
Laaaaaaaaaa-dieeeeeeeeeezzzz. 

---

## CLAUDIA:
Oh, thank goodness. 


---

## WYNN:
Who is that?

---

## CLAUDIA:
The instructor! 


---

## GARY:
Who? 

---

## WYNN:
That’s…the instructor?

---

## CLAUDIA:
I told you he’d find us.

---

## GARY:
Where?

---

## WYNN:
That? 

---

## CLAUDIA:
I hope he’s good.

---

I asked for the best.


---

## WYNN:
Oh my god.

---

## GARY:
Woof.

---

## WYNN:
Oh my god.

---

## GARY:
Woof. 

---

## WYNN:
Oh my god.

---

## CLAUDIA:
Girls!


---

## BLAZE:
Heyyyyyyyyyyyyy.


---

## BLAZE:
Um…Claudia Rutters?

---

## CLAUDIA:
Here! 

---

## BLAZE:
Yeah, I was looking for you out on the beach but I didn’t see you.

---

## CLAUDIA:
They told us at the shop to head straight out and that you would find us – 

---

## BLAZE:
Yeah we usually start people out on the beach.

---

But if we head back now we should probably have enough time to catch a couple waves before my next lesson.  

---

## GARY:
Back?

---

I’m not going back!

---

## BLAZE:
Yeah, totally.

---

I just have to go over some board basics before we get started.

---

You know.

---

On the beach.

---

## WYNN:
Great call, Claudia.

---

## CLAUDIA:
At the shop, they told us, that person, what was her name?

---

The angry one, with the holes in her ears.

---

She said head straight out and –

---

## WYNN:
Great call.

---

## BLAZE:
Cool, so if you ladies will just turn around and paddle after me – 


---

## GARY:
STOP!

---

HELP!

---

EMERGENCY!


---

## BLAZE:
Yo, what’s up? 

---

## GARY:
I can’t go back to the beach.

---

## BLAZE:
Totally.

---

So I’m gonna paddle behind you, okay?

---

That way I can push your board so that you don’t have to paddle.

---

## GARY:
You misunderstand me, tadpole.

---

I won’t go back to the beach. 

---

## CLAUDIA:
(wisely) That’s a very common mistake.

---

Can’t.

---

Won’t. 


---

## WYNN:
Claudia.


---

## GARY:
I want to go surfing!

---

I want to go surfing! 

---

## BLAZE:
Okay, okay, okay!

---

Um…I guess I can go through some of the stuff here…?

---

## CLAUDIA:
Are you sure?

---

I don’t want to miss any important information. 

---

## BLAZE:
(not that sure) Yeah…


---

## BLAZE:
Okay!

---

So!

---

We got Claudia and  –

---

## GARY:
Margaret.

---

That’s how I was baptized.

---

But the cool kids call me Gary. 

---

## BLAZE:
Gary, nice, and – 

---

## CLAUDIA:
Winifred Peterson.

---

## WYNN:
CLAUDIA.

---

## CLAUDIA:
That’s what I put on the form! 

---

## WYNN:
It’s Wynn. 



---

## BLAZE:
Wynn.

---

Gary.

---

Claudia.

---

Beautiful names, ladies.

---

I’m gonna try and remember those.

---

My name is Blaze and I will be your surf instructor today.

---

We are gonna have ourselves an awesome day today, you guys.

---

Conditions are perfect out there.

---

The waves are totally frothing.

---

## CLAUDIA:
This is the beginner’s lesson, right?


## GARY:
Ooooh can I just adopt you?


## WYNN:
I go by Wynn.

---

## BLAZE:
Woooaaah onslaught haha.


---

## BLAZE:
Okay!

---

So!

---

Who here has surfed before?



---

## CLAUDIA:
I take a water aerobics class on Wednesdays at 2 pm at the Y.

---

## GARY:
I ride public transportation!

---

## WYNN:
Excuse me?

---

## GARY:
You know, when you stand in the middle of the train with no hands and go WHEEE!

---

## CLAUDIA:
I think we’re all beginners, Blaze.

---

## BLAZE:
I love to see it!

---

Okay.

---

So, what do you think is the most important thing about surfing?

---

## GARY:
Shredding!

---

The shredding!

---

## BLAZE:
Nice try, Gary.

---

But actually I’m looking for a different “S word.” 

---

## CLAUDIA:
Security?


## WYNN:
Sunburn.

---

## BLAZE:
Close, Claudia!

---

Safety!

---

Because here at the Santa Cruz Surf Skool, we believe the best ride is the safest ride. 

---

## CLAUDIA:
I think that’s very wise.

---

## BLAZE:
If you feel out of control at any point today, I want you to put a hand up like this.

---

Can I see you guys try that?

---

## BLAZE:
Awesome!

---

Now that we have completed our safety training, we are going to go over –

---

## CLAUDIA:
Blaze!

---

Excuse me, Mr.

---

Blaze!

---

## BLAZE:
Claudia, yo. 

---

## CLAUDIA:
What about the rest of the safety training?

---

## BLAZE:
Yeah we kinda have to go back to the beach to do the rest. 

---

## CLAUDIA:
Then maybe we should – 

---

## GARY:
(in a Russian accent) NYET, COMRADE!

---

NO GOING BACK! 

---

## CLAUDIA:
I’d just like to point out that the three of us are not quite as young as Mr.

---

Blaze, and - 

---

## WYNN:
Oh my god.


## GARY:
Speak for yourself, granny!


---

## GARY:
I fully intend to live into my nineties.

---

## CLAUDIA:
And, while this all seems very fun, I just want to make sure that we are doing everything in our power to make today as safe as possible.

---

Like I tell my students: to be overprepared is to be ready for success.

---

## WYNN:
You are being such an asshole right now.  

---

## BLAZE:
Don’t worry.

---

Everything is going to be totally okay.

---

## CLAUDIA:
How do you know that?

---

Are you a psychic?

---

## GARY:
We’ll be fine!

---

We’re in the hands of an expert! 

---

## CLAUDIA:
How old are you? 

---

## BLAZE:
Nineteen.


---

## CLAUDIA:
I can’t do this.

---

## WYNN:
Claudia!


## GARY:
You promised!

---

## CLAUDIA:
No, I’m sorry, I thought I could do this, but I can’t.

---

I can’t do this. 

---

## GARY:
But – but – but – 

---

## WYNN:
This was your fucking idea!


---

## CLAUDIA:
I’m sorry, there are just times in life when you have to put your foot down and stand up for yourself and this is one of those times. 

---

## GARY:
But – but - 



---

## CLAUDIA:
Okay.


---

## WYNN:
Excuse me? 

---

## GARY:
Really?

---

## CLAUDIA:
Of course.


---

## GARY:
Oh, thank you baby! 

---

## WYNN:
What the hell was that?

---

## GARY:
You have such a giving spirit. 

---

## CLAUDIA:
I just think it’s important to support those who support me. 

---

## GARY:
You know I love you, Claudia.

---

## CLAUDIA:
I love you too, Gare-Bear.

---

## WYNN:
Oh, and I love you John-Boy and I love YOU Jim-Bob! 

Beat.

---

## BLAZE:
Okay!

---

So the next thing we’re gonna do is strap on our leashes.

---

## WYNN:
Leashes?

---

Like for dogs?

---

## BLAZE:
Haha.

---

No.

---

Different kind of leash.


---

## BLAZE:
Your leash attaches you to your board so that you don’t lose it when you wipe out.

---

Also, if you’re drowning you can always tell which direction is up cause your surfboard will float to the surface and - *

---

## CLAUDIA:
What?

---

I’m going to drown?

---

## GARY:
Which foot do I put it on?

---

## CLAUDIA:
Am I going to drown?

---

## BLAZE:
Yeah so most people put it on their right foot, which is regular, but if you’re goofy then you put it on the left one, like me. 

---

## CLAUDIA:
What if it’s tied around the wrong foot? 

---

## BLAZE:
You’ll probably just fall off.

---

## CLAUDIA:
And drown?

---

## WYNN:
How do I know if I’m this goofy thing or whatever? 


---

## GARY:
You’re goofy.

---

Especially after a few shots of tequila.

---

Then you’re really goofy.

---

## BLAZE:
When you ride a bike, which foot leads when you pedal downhill? 

---

## CLAUDIA:
I don’t know how to ride a bike.



## GARY:
O-HO!


---

## BLAZE:
Looking good, Gary.

---

## CLAUDIA:
I don’t know how to ride a bike.

---

## BLAZE:
Okay so when you’re wearing socks and you run and slide across a kitchen floor, which foot do you lead with? 



---

## CLAUDIA:
I think you and I do very different things with our free time.

---

## BLAZE:
Put it on your right foot. 


---

## GARY:
I read in Surfer Magazine that native Hawai’ians don’t use leashes, is that true?

---

## BLAZE:
Yeah some guys are going back to the traditional surf roots and stuff.

---

## GARY:
So true surfers don’t need a leash.



---

## BLAZE:
No, no, no, Gary, I think you should definitely – 

---

## CLAUDIA:
Help!

---

I’m drowning!

---

HELP!

---

## BLAZE:
Claudia, it isn’t too deep here.

---

You can probably touch the bottom. 

---

## CLAUDIA:
Oh. 


---

## GARY:
Cowabunga!

---

Let’s boogie!

---

## CLAUDIA:
Wynn doesn’t have her leash on.

---

## WYNN:
I’m getting in touch with my inner Hawaiian.

---

## BLAZE:
Haha.

---

Totally.

---

But, like, actually you do need to put on your leash.

---

It’s school protocol.

---

## WYNN:
Everyone’s a goddamn socialist these days.

---

## BLAZE:
Awesome!

---

So!

---

The key to being a good surfer is being a good paddler. 


---

## BLAZE:
See how slow I’m going?

---

That’s crucial.

---

Most people think you have to go fast but what really matters is how deep you go.

---

## WYNN:
Tell that to my ex-husband.

---

## BLAZE:
Okay!

---

Let me see you practice your paddle in the air.

That looks really good, Claudia!

---

Both arms, Wynn.

---

## CLAUDIA:
What?

---

## GARY:
How am I doing? 

---

## BLAZE:
A little slower, Gary.

---

Think about pulling the water beneath you.

---

## GARY:
Like this?

---

## BLAZE:
Keep trying.

---

Wynn, you gotta use both arms.

---

## GARY:
Ignore her.

---

She’s an only child.

---

## CLAUDIA:
That’s not true.

---

She has two step-brothers.

---

Owen and Graphite.

---

No.

---

Griffin.

---

Griffith.

---

## GARY:
She is in essence an only child. 

---

## CLAUDIA:
Griffith Gallagher!

---

Remember?

---

He was in Mrs. Blanchard’s class with us?

---

Oh, this is a funny story, Blaze.

---

So, Winifred and I were both assigned to Mrs. Blanchard for the first grade and Gary was supposed to be with Mrs. Kaye.

---

## GARY:
Mrs. Kaye!

---

She used to pluck her chin hairs with a binder clip!

---

## CLAUDIA:
I knew Wynn because she was the only one on the block who would come over and play at my house, but I didn’t know Gary because her family had just moved from New Jersey.

---

## CLAUDIA:
But then, Dennis Carmichael tried to cut off my pigtail, 

---

and Wynn tried to stop him but Dennis had a crush on her so that made things worse but then Gary hit him right in the tummy and we became best friends for all of elementary school, 

---

plus junior high, plus high school, and then Wynn got married and Gary and I went to San Francisco State and then Gary went to law school 

---

and I started having kids, Michael, he’s my oldest, and Marli, they’re graduated now, my children.

---

Michael received his medical degree from Stanford and then my husband and I retired to Potrero Hill.

---

Have you ever been to Potrero Hill?

---

## WYNN:
I thought it was Delaware.

---

## GARY:
Jersey City, baby.

---

## WYNN:
Pierce and I did a week in Atlantic City once.

---

## GARY:
Brave little toasters!

---

## WYNN:
I like Atlantic City. 

---

## GARY:
You would.

---

## WYNN:
What does that mean?

---

## GARY:
Atlantic City’s for sellouts. 

---

## WYNN:
Bullshit.

---

## GARY:
If you want real Jersey, you gotta 
go south of the border.

---

## WYNN:
Which would be Delaware.

---

## GARY:
Cape May.

---

Now that’s Joisey.

---

## WYNN:
Didn’t you leave New Jersey when you were six?

---

## GARY:
Once a Shoobie, always a Shoobie


---

## CLAUDIA:
It’s in a very accessible part of San Francisco, just off the Bay Bridge, and there’s a wonderful French place that makes very good “croque monsieurs” and -

---

## WYNN:
So, Blaze, correct me if I’m wrong, but I thought there was a standing portion to this whole surf thing.

---

## BLAZE:
Oh yeah!

---

The pop up!

---

Shoot.

---

I don’t know how I’m gonna show you that on the water… 

---

## CLAUDIA:
She told us, in the shop, to go straight -

---

## BLAZE:
Okay, okay, so you’re paddling, right?

---

You’re paddling, you’re paddling, you’re paddling, and then woah all of a sudden you see the wave and you pop up, right?

---

## GARY:
Right! 

---

## BLAZE:
Wrong!

---

You don’t pop up when you see the wave.

---

You pop up when you feel the wave.

---

## GARY:
Ohhhhhh.

---

## WYNN:
What does that even mean? 

---

## BLAZE:
Yeah, so the “pop up” is the process of standing up on the wave. 

---

## WYNN:
No, obviously, no, I know that.

---

I’m talking about that other thing, that “feeling” crap.

---

## BLAZE:
Oh yeah.

---

so like, the waves are coming at us pretty fast, right?

---

## CLAUDIA:
Yes.

---

## BLAZE:
The reason we paddle is to catch up to the speed of the waves.

---

If you pop up too fast, you’ll kill your momentum.

---

If you stand up too slow, the wave will break on top of you.

---

The key is to stand when you’re going the same speed as the wave.

---

I hear lots of people say that they missed a wave cause their board wasn’t the right size, or they weren’t in 
the right place.

---

Nah.

---

Usually, it’s cause they weren’t feeling the wave beneath them.

---

You gotta feel it if you wanna catch it.

---

## GARY:
Like herpes. 

---

## CLAUDIA:
Is there some sort of signal we should be looking for?

---

So that we know when to start the pop up?

---

## BLAZE:
Um…

---

## BLAZE:
Okay, so do you guys see that guy over there?

---

On the green board?

---

Watch him.

---

I think he’s about to go for this next wave.

---

## BLAZE:
He’s paddling, right?

---

See how he’s paddling?

---

He’s going nice and steady, he’s not rushing he’s just paddling, he’s COME ON KOLOHE PADDLE BUDDY, okay he’s looking behind him, checking the wave YOU GOT THIS DUDE!

---

PADDLE!

---

PADDLE!

---

## GARY:
PADDLE!

---

PADDLE!

---

PADDLE!


---

## BLAZE:
Okay, he’s stopped paddling, he’s straightening out, he’s COME ON KOKO, and yep, yep, there he goes, back foot, right foot, uncle stance, 

---

he’s - up, up, pop up, beam me up scotty, beam me YOU’RE ON A BOMB DUDE, see but you can also, with the knees if IT’S TOTALLY EXPLODING, makes the drop, angling in, 

---

he’s NICE ONE it’s doubling, 
tripling, totally washing machine, it’s WATCH YOUR RAILS DUDE and he’s, nice,  

---

water off, sucking up, up, okay, he’s deep, good, good face, yes, barrel, yes, nice, yes, nice, nice, 

---

GROM ON YOUR LEFT yes, all the way, all the way, yes, to the soup, to the soup, GET INTO THAT YES!

---

YES!

---

YES!!

---


KOLOHE!!

---

DUDE!!


---

YOU WERE BEYOND VERTICAL!!

---

YOU WERE TOTALLY COVERED UP DUDE THAT WAS TOTALLY OG!!

---

WOOOOO!!

---

## BLAZE:
So.

---

Any questions?

---

## BLAZE:
Awesome.

---

Let’s roll.

---

## GARY:
This is – Wynn, you look tired maybe we should take a break. 


---

## WYNN:
I’m fine.

---

I don’t need to take a break.

---

Do you need to take a break?

---

## GARY:
I don’t need to take a break, why would I need to take a break?

---

## WYNN:
You were the one who suggested that we should take a break.

---

## GARY:
It was a suggestion, I feel fine.

---

I could do this for hours. 

---

## WYNN:

Me too.

---

## GARY:
We’re young.

---

We’re fit.

---

Why would we need a break?

---

## CLAUDIA:
I could maybe use a minute to catch my breath.

## GARY
Hallelujah.

---

## WYNN:
Oh thank god.

---

## CLAUDIA:
Isn’t this nice?

---

Being all together again?


---


## CLAUDIA:
IS THAT A SHARK?

---

## CLAUDIA:
Never mind, it’s a piece of kelp.


---

## CLAUDIA:
I’m fine. 


---

## GARY:
Who is THAT? 

---

## WYNN:
Blaze?

---

Our instructor?

---

## GARY:
THAT’S Blaze?

---

I thought that was a minor deity.

---

Look how tight his wetsuit is.

---

## CLAUDIA:
Gary!

---

Blaze is a minor!

---

## GARY:
No, he’s an option.

---

## WYNN:
Legally speaking, he’s an adult.

---

## GARY:
Yeah?

---

How about it, Wynniebago?

---

Wanna habeus his corpus?

---

## WYNN:
God no.

---

No, I’m swearing off men.

---

## GARY:
Smart cookie. 

---

## CLAUDIA:
What’s wrong with men?

---

Some are very nice.

---

For example, Georgie - 

---

## GARY:
Oh my gosh, Wynn, what if you became a lesbian and we moved to one of those beachside lesbian communities and did ceramics!

---

## WYNN:
No thanks.

---

## GARY:
I’m telling you, the sex is incredible.

---

## WYNN:
I bet.

---

## GARY:
Seriously, Wynn.

---

The vagina is a scary place for men with low self-esteem.

---

You deserve someone who knows what they’re doing.

---

The best thing about being a lesbian is you don’t have to fake orgasms anymore!

---

## CLAUDIA:
I don’t fake org – org – orga-



---

## WYNN:
What was that, Claudia?

---

## GARY:
An orca?

---

## CLAUDIA:
You both know very well what I mean.

---

## GARY:
I’m sorry, Claudia, I simply have no idea what you’re talking about.

---

## WYNN:
Maybe it would be easier if you used an “I” statement. 

---

## CLAUDIA:
All I meant to say is that Georgie and I love each other in a way that feels satisfying and supportive.

---

## WYNN:
You mean he still doesn’t know where your clitoris is?

---

## GARY:
Hey, Wynn, know who’s seen more action than Claudia? 

---

## WYNN:
Who? 

---

## GARY:
The inside of my wetsuit. 


---

## GARY:
No, no, no wait.

---

I can do better.

---

## CLAUDIA:
For your information, I have a very fulfilling sexual life. 

---

## WYNN:
That’s right.

---

Because you’re the adventurous one. 

---

## CLAUDIA:
Georgie is very tender towards me.

---

We consider ourselves co-creators of the intimate space.


---

## GARY:
Okay, okay, I got it, I got it!

---

Guess who’s seen more action than Claudia? 


---


## WYNN:
Steven Paccetti?


## GARY:
My mother’s ashes - oooh, that’s a good one! 

---

## GARY:
I like yours better.

---

## CLAUDIA:
I have seen plenty of action!

---

## WYNN:
Is that so?

---

## CLAUDIA:
I just prefer to keep my private life private, that’s all.

---

## GARY:
Does Georgie do dark twisted things that you’re too embarrassed to talk about? 

---

## CLAUDIA:
No!

---

We have a loving, consensual - 

---

## GARY:
Does he use food?

---

## CLAUDIA:
Gary!

---

You know our house has an ant problem!

---

## WYNN:
What about role-play?

---

## CLAUDIA:
Can we not – 

---

## GARY:
Handcuffs? 

---

## CLAUDIA:
Please – 

---

## WYNN:
Whips?

---

## CLAUDIA:
I don’t - 

---

## GARY:
Nipple clamps?

---

## WYNN:
Butt plugs?

---

## GARY:
Anal beads?

---

## CLAUDIA:
I have never - 

---

## WYNN:
A loofie?


---

## WYNN:
THOSE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE FOR THE BATH, CLAUDIA!

---

## CLAUDIA:
Wynn, keep your voice down – 

---

## WYNN:
YOU’RE SUPPOSED TO USE THEM ON YOUR PORES! 

---

## CLAUDIA:
Well, I think it feels very nice when Georgie presses it … down there.

---

## WYNN:
Oh my god.

---

Oh my god!

---

## GARY:
Claudia!

---

## CLAUDIA:
What?

---

It’s a perfectly reasonable – 

---

## GARY:
You are a sexual deviant.

---

## CLAUDIA:
No I am not!

---

## GARY:
CLAUDIA RUTTERS IS A SEXUAL DEVIANT!

---

## CLAUDIA:
Gary!

---

People are looking! 

---

## WYNN:
Do you wash it after you use it or do you just let it hang there like proof?

---

## CLAUDIA:
Actually, we have a special one for – 

---

## WYNN:
YOU HAVE A SEX LOOFAH?? 

---

## CLAUDIA:
Be quiet! 

---

## GARY:
You should be proud!

---

You have a fetish!

---

That makes you interesting! 

---

## WYNN:
HOW LONG HAVE YOU HAD A SEX LOOFAH??

---

## CLAUDIA:
Winifred, please!

---

## WYNN:
HAVE I USED YOUR SEX LOOFAH??


---

## BLAZE:
Ladies!

---

How’s it going?

---

Who ready to go surfing?

---

## GARY:
Me!

---

Me!

---

I am!

---

## BLAZE:
Woah, Gary!

---

And actually, we want to go that way.

---

See all those surfers over there?


---

## BLAZE:
That’s called the line-up.

---

That’s where we’re gonna catch our waves.

---

## GARY:
We have to wait in line? 

---

## CLAUDIA:
Gosh.

---

That’s a lot of people. 

---

## BLAZE:
Being in a line-up is how you figure out whose wave it is.

---

We can’t all go for the same wave, right?

---

That would be a major collision situation.

---

So we gotta take turns.

---

## CLAUDIA:
Like kindergarten! 

---

## BLAZE:
Yeah!

---

## CLAUDIA:
Sharing is caring.

---

## BLAZE:
I’m gonna take you guys out to the line-up one at a time.

---

When you’re not with me, I want you to hang here, okay?

---

Let’s call this the safe zone.

---

When you catch a wave,  
paddle back to the safe zone.

---

If you lose your board at any point, use your safety signal.

---

Do we remember the safety signal?


---

## BLAZE:
Awesome.

---

So who wants to -

---

## GARY:
SHOTGUN!


---

## BLAZE:
Gary, I am loving that energy! 

---

## WYNN:
Don’t encourage her.

---

## GARY:
Said the fossil.

---

## BLAZE:
Okay, Wynn and Claudia, you guys stay here.

---

Gary, follow me out to the line-up.

---

Remember, we want to paddle around the wave.

---

Not straight towards the line-up.

---

Around the -


---

## BLAZE:
Wait!

---

Gary!

---

Around the wave!


---

## BLAZE:
We have to paddle around the wave!

---

## GARY:
This wave?

---

## BLAZE:
No, Gary!

---

That’s not what I –

---

## BLAZE:
Wait! 


---

## GARY:
Did I get it?

---

Did I get it? 

---

## BLAZE:
Gary, you gotta make sure you look behind you before you start paddling.

---

There could have been somebody already riding that wave.

---

## GARY:
But there wasn’t!

---

It was my wave!

---

## BLAZE:
Just wait for me next time, okay? 

---

## GARY:
Okay, DUDE.

---

## BLAZE:
I’ll tell you when to start paddling.

---

I want you to focus on feeling the water beneath you, feeling the wave.

---

And when you fall, I want you to -

---

## GARY:
Oh, I won’t fall. 

---

## BLAZE:
Everybody falls. 

---

## GARY:
Not me.

---

I’m a pro.

---

## BLAZE:
You have to fall off if you want to get back on.

---

## GARY:
Well, aren’t you the cutest little motivational poster.

---

## BLAZE:
No that’s, like, how you surf.

---

## GARY:
Hey.

---

Take it easy.

---

I’ve got this all under control.


---

## WYNN:
Goddamn suicide machines.

---

## CLAUDIA:
Oh my gosh.

---

## WYNN:
This is elder abuse.	

---

## WYNN:
CLAUDIA!!

---

## CLAUDIA:
Sorry, I’m sorry, I just – they’re so - wobbly!


---

## WYNN:
Does saltwater dissolve Botox?

---

## CLAUDIA:
What?

---

## WYNN:
Never mind. 

---

## CLAUDIA:
Do you want me to ask my son Michael? 

---

## WYNN:
Do not ask Michael.

---

## CLAUDIA:
He went to Stanford.

---

## WYNN:
Michael does not need to know about my Botox.

---

## CLAUDIA:
Sweetie, everybody knows.


---

## CLAUDIA:
I can’t see!

---

There’s salt in my eyes!

---

I can’t see!

---

Help!

---

Help! 


---

## WYNN:
Oh hi!

---

No, I’m not with her.

---

Oh, that’s too sweet.

---

No, she’s fine.

---

Of course.

---

Have a nice day!


---

## CLAUDIA:
Okay. 


---

## CLAUDIA:
That was not funny, Winifred. 

---

## WYNN:
Really?

---

I’m having a blast.


---


## CLAUDIA:
I do not appreciate it when you deliberately attempt to destabilize me. 

---

## WYNN:
See, that’s so interesting because I do not appreciate it when you deliberately lie to me.


---


## CLAUDIA:
What are you talking about?

---

## WYNN:
You said you wanted to go surfing for your birthday.

---

## CLAUDIA:
So?


---

## CLAUDIA:
We’re surfing.

---

It’s almost my birthday.

---

I don’t see how anything I said was a lie.

---

## WYNN:
Why didn’t you tell me she was coming?


---

## CLAUDIA:
I – 

---

## WYNN:
Lied.

---

You lied.

---

## CLAUDIA:
Technically, I omitted.

---

But only because I -

---

## WYNN:
You manipulated me.

---

## CLAUDIA:
I wanted to make sure you would come!

---

I wanted it to be the three of us.

---

## WYNN:
What, and you thought I wouldn’t have come if I knew ---

GARY was going to be here?


---

## WYNN:
Wow. 

---

## CLAUDIA:
I just think – 

---

## WYNN:
Wow. 

---

## CLAUDIA:
You can be conflict avoidant sometimes and - 

---

## WYNN:
That is low, Claudia. 

---

## CLAUDIA:
And part of that comes from being an Aquarius, but I also think part of it  comes -

---

## WYNN:
Gary is my best friend. 


---


## CLAUDIA:
I know, but you aren’t always great at being there, and that’s not a criticism, it’s who you are, it’s who you’ve always been.


---

## WYNN:
Jesus Fucking Christ. 

I have a lot going on right now. 

---

## CLAUDIA:
I know.

---

But after the opera, when Gary told us what was going on you disappeared.

---

## WYNN:
The Golf Club just asked me to redesign the newsletter logo, on top of coordinating next month’s Napa trip, 

---

and the damn benefit is taking forever to plan because, surprise surprise, turns out Joanna is a raging megalomaniac, and Mark isn’t any help, 

---

I mean, Christ, when did everyone collectively decide to insert a javelin up their own assholes?


---


## CLAUDIA:
And the divorce.



---

## CLAUDIA:
Do you want to talk about it? 

---

## WYNN:
I don’t want to talk about it. 

---

## CLAUDIA:
Because I’m here for you if you need anything or if you want to talk about it.

---

## WYNN:
I do not want to talk about it. 


---

## CLAUDIA:
“You do not have to be good.

---

”

---

## WYNN:
Excuse me?

---

## CLAUDIA:
“You do not have to walk on your knees
for a hundred miles through the –”

---

## WYNN:
Are you on drugs?

---

## CLAUDIA:
Wild Geese.

---

It’s a poem.

---

“You only have to let the soft animal of your body”-

---

## WYNN:
It’s a divorce, Claudia.

---

There were no casualties.

---

## CLAUDIA:
I know, but - 

---

## WYNN:
I’ve done this before.

---

## CLAUDIA:
But you were with Pierce for so long and what with the grandkids -

---

## WYNN:
They’re not mine.

---

## CLAUDIA:
But they call you Nana.

---

## WYNN:
Exactly.

---

Do I look like a Nana to you?



---

## CLAUDIA:
Oh, Wynnie.


---

## CLAUDIA:
What?

---

## WYNN:
“Oh, Wynnie” 

---

## CLAUDIA:
I’m empathizing with you because I care about you!


---

## WYNN:
You’re pitying me.

---

## CLAUDIA:
The divine light in me recognizes the divine light in you!

---

That’s what Namaste means.

---

## WYNN:
You’re making me feel fucking defective. 

---

## CLAUDIA:
I think sometimes the judgements we perceive to be coming from other people are actually coming from within ourselves.

---

## WYNN:
You’re supposed to be on my side!

---

## CLAUDIA:
I am on your side!

---

I’m always on your side!

---

That’s what the poem’s about!

---

“Tell me about despair, yours, and I’ll tell you mine.

---

Meanwhile –”


---

## CLAUDIA:
Winifred!

---

Those were supposed to be for our security whistles!


---

## WYNN:
This is my security whistle.


---

## GARY:
Now?

---

## BLAZE:
Not yet.


---

## GARY:
Now?

---

## BLAZE:
Not yet.

---

## GARY:
How about now?

---

## BLAZE:
Patience, Gary.

---

## GARY:
Patience, patience, patience.



---

## GARY:
So I’m actually not good at this whole “patience” thing, is the problem. 

---

## BLAZE:
The waves will come.

---

I promise.

---

## GARY:
I’m a public defender, Moon Doggy.

---

I don’t take promises lightly.

---

## BLAZE:
Just try and relax. 

---

## GARY:
Right.

---

## BLAZE:
Be in the moment. 

---

## GARY:
Right.

---

## BLAZE:
Let everything go.

---

## BLAZE:
Hey, can you scooch back for me? 

---

## GARY:
What?

---

## BLAZE:
You’re too far forward on your board.

---

Your nose might pearl. 

---

## GARY:
My nose?

---

## BLAZE:
The nose of your board.

---

There’s too much weight on it. 

---

## GARY:
What?

---

## BLAZE:
Scooch back, just a little.

---

## BLAZE:
A little bit more.

---

## BLAZE:
A little bit more.

---

## GARY:
Look, I’m a seal!


---

## BLAZE:
A little bit more.

---

So your toes touch the water.


---

## BLAZE:
Now you’re ready to surf.

---

## GARY:
My whole life I wanted to be surfer, ever since I was a little girl.

---

## BLAZE:
I love to hear it.

---

## GARY:
But my mother was terrified of the ocean, terrified.

---

We’d come down to the beach and in this really witchy voice she’d say “Margaret Ann, if you so much as put one toe in that water, you are going to drown.”

---

## BLAZE:
Why did your mother come to the beach if she didn’t like the ocean?

---

## GARY:
Because she was my mother.

---

Suffering was her modus operandi.

---

## BLAZE:
Yeah.

---

My mom can be like that sometimes.

---

## GARY:
Oh really?

---

Is your mother also a Catholic? 

---

## BLAZE:
Nah, she’s into chakras and stuff.
---
## GARY:
Ooh, a pagan.

---

## BLAZE:
I guess. 

---

## GARY:
I love pagans.

---

They’re so spontaneous. 



---

## GARY:
Chakras are those little glowy color balls, right? 

---

## BLAZE:
Yeah, I think they’re like energy centers or something.

---

I don’t know.

---

It’s kind of my mom’s thing.

---

## GARY:
Did your mother teach you how to surf?

---

## BLAZE:
No.

---

My dad.

---

He’s pro.

---

## GARY:
Really? 

---

## BLAZE:
Yeah, he’s a big wave rider out in Hawaii. 

---

## GARY:
Wow.

---

Did he teach you how to surf?

---

## BLAZE:
Yeah…

---

## GARY:
You are lucky.

---

You are so lucky.

---

Take advantage of that, Blaze, that’s the only advice I’ll give you and then I’ll shut up like a good little oyster.

---

Take advantage of what life gives you and be damn grateful. 

---

## BLAZE:
Yeah.

---

## GARY:
Because you are lucky.

---

So lucky. 

---

## BLAZE:
Yeah. 

---

## GARY:
Don’t just sit there “yeah-ing” at me like a naïve little ingrate.

---

You are a passionate person, so don’t you – 

---

## BLAZE:
WAVE, GARY!

---

## GARY:
WHAT? 


---

## GARY:
AH!

---

CRAP!

---

## BLAZE:
PADDLE, GARY, PADDLE, PADDLE PADDLE PADDLE!!

---

## GARY:
HOLY SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT!


---

## CLAUDIA:
Gary!

---

Gary, sweetie, are you okay? 

---

## WYNN:
Oh my god.


---

## GARY:
Did you see me?

---

## CLAUDIA:
Do you want me to stop the lesson?

---

I can stop the lesson.

---

EXCUSE ME MR. BLAZE -

---

## GARY:
I’m fine, Claudia!

---

I’m spectacular!

---

I’M SURFING! 


---

## GARY:
Oh my god, I feel like I could conquer the world!

## WYNN:
Calm down, Napoleon.	

---

## GARY:
Should I leave Anika?

---

## CLAUDIA:
What? 


---

## GARY:
What if she’s holding me back?

---

I mean, look at me!

---

I just surfed a wave. 

---

## CLAUDIA:
What does that have to do with Anika?

---

## GARY:
She’s afraid!

---

She doesn’t want me to pop-up!

---

She wants me to pop down, down, down, doggie!

---

But sometimes you have to pop up if you want to find your true purpose in life!

---

How am I supposed to find my true purpose if Anika keeps limiting my potential?

---

“Margaret, don’t walk so fast.” “Don’t light the stove with a match.” “Don’t buy sneakers with laces.” She’s just like my mother!

---

Remember?

---

After high school?

---

When we were going to travel the vineyards of France only my mother wouldn’t let me go 
because she thought I was going to become an alcoholic?

---

What if that was it?

---

What if my true purpose was to live in Bordeaux and make wine?

---

## WYNN:
But you hate Cabernet.

---

## GARY:
I love Cabernet.

---

## WYNN:
You always say Cabernet is only good for district attorneys and the sexually repressed.

---

## GARY:
I did not say that.

---

When did I say that?

---

## WYNN:
Every time we ate at that French restaurant.

---

## GARY:
Which restaurant?

---

## WYNN:
The one in Potrero Hill.

---

Where Claudia used to take singing lessons.

---

Remember?

---

## GARY:
I don’t…

---

## WYNN:
You’d get the steak and I’d get bouillabaisse and Claudia would ask for the sandwich with no crusts.

---

What was it called?

---

## CLAUDIA:
Le croque monsieur. 

---

## GARY:
Potrero Hill?

---

## WYNN:
It was called Bonne Maison.

---

## GARY:
I haven’t been.

---

To Potrero Hill.

---

## WYNN:
Yes you have.

---

## CLAUDIA:
Wynn.

---

## GARY:
No.

---

No, I don’t think I’ve been to -

---

## WYNN:
Then where did we have dinner every Monday night for ten years, Gary?

---

Fucking McDonalds?

---

## CLAUDIA:
Wynn.

---

## GARY:
No…we went to…we went to…

---

## WYNN:
Jesus Christ.

---

## CLAUDIA:
Winifred! 

---

## GARY:
Ohhhhh!

---

Potrero Hill!

---

I thought you said - but you said Potrero Hill.

---

Oh no, of course I remember Potrero Hill.

---

Down by San Jose. 

---

## WYNN:
Potrero Hill is in San Francisco.

---

## GARY:
Right, that’s what I said.

---

Oh my god!

---

Look!

It’s Blaze.

---

He’s taking a wave.

---

And he’s amazing


---

## CLAUDIA:
That was very impressive, young man. 

---

## BLAZE:
What are you guys doing all the way over here?

---

I thought I lost you for a second.

---

## GARY:
I want to do that.

---

Teach me how to do that.

---

## CLAUDIA:
We didn’t go anywhere.

---

We stayed exactly where you told us to stay.

---

## BLAZE:
No, the safe zone is over there.


---

## BLAZE:
The current must have taken you guys.

---

## CLAUDIA:
There’s a current? 

---

## BLAZE:
There’s always a current. 

---

## CLAUDIA:
What??

---

## BLAZE:
A current is just whatever direction the water is moving in.

---

They’re not always dangerous.

---

But I can show you something that can help you guys stay in place.

---

It’s called triangulation. 



---


## CLAUDIA:
Is that calculus?

---

## GARY:
Strangulation!!

---

## CLAUDIA:
I was never good at calculus.

---

## BLAZE:
Triangulation.

---

I don’t usually bring it up in beginner lessons.

---

But it’s actually pretty easy.

---

Okay, think of a triangle, right?

---

Three points.

---

Three angles.


---

## BLAZE:
The goal of triangulation is to maintain the triangle.

---

You, the surfer, are point one.

---

Then you pick two other points, like…

---

## GARY:
The boat!

---

## BLAZE:
Something that won’t move.

---

Like the taco shop… and that palm tree.

---

So I’ve got my triangle, right?

---

Me, taco shop, palm tree.

---

When I’m out on the water, I’m always trying
to maintain the triangle.

---

If a wave takes me super far away, all I have to do is look back at the shore, find my points, and paddle back until I make the triangle again. 

---

## GARY:
So we need to find three – 

---

## BLAZE:
Two -

---

## GARY:
Two points…

---

## CLAUDIA:
And from your experience, what are the best points to pick?

---

## GARY:
(to Wynn) Are you picking the church?


---


## BLAZE:
There aren’t really any best -	

---

## WYNN:
No.


---

## GARY:
DIBS ON THE CHURCH.

---

## BLAZE:
Alright, who’s next?

---

Claudia?

---

## CLAUDIA:
But I haven’t picked out my points yet!

---

## BLAZE:
That’s okay. 

---

## CLAUDIA:
But -

---

## GARY:
Ooh, I’ll go! 

---

## BLAZE:
C’mon, Claudia.

---

You got this. 

---

## CLAUDIA:
Oh my gosh.

---

Okay. 

---

## BLAZE:
That’s what I’m talking about!

---

Let’s go!

---

## GARY:
Have fun.

---

## CLAUDIA:
Thanks!

---

## WYNN:
Watch out for the sharks.

---

## CLAUDIA:
What?


---

## CLAUDIA:
Wait!

---

There are - wait, Blaze!

---

Blaze, are there actually – wait!



---

## GARY:
You look good, Wynn

---

## WYNN:
Thanks.

---

## GARY:
I look like a mushroom.

---

Little Miss Portobello.

---


## GARY:
Ow.

---

## WYNN:
Gary?

---

## GARY:
Nothing.

---

It’s nothing.


---

## WYNN:
Gary.

---

## GARY:
Don’t worry.

---

I am completely – 


---

## WYNN:
Should I call Claudia?

---

## GARY:
No, no, no, it’s okay, it’s okay, I’m – 


---

## WYNN:
Claudia!

---

 Claudia!

---

## GARY:
No!

---

Just come here.

---

## WYNN:
I can’t!

---

Claudia!

---

## GARY:
Just get over here.

---

Help me.

---

## WYNN:
You’re paying for that!!

---

## GARY:
Oh yeah?

---

## WYNN:
Get over here, you little squirt!

---

## GARY:
Never!!


---

## GARY:
I’m king of the world!!

---

## BLAZE:
Remember, we’re going to paddle around the wave.

---

## CLAUDIA:
Around the wave.


---

## BLAZE:
Awesome, Claudia. 

---

## CLAUDIA:
Around the wave.

---

## BLAZE:
You’re doing great.

---

## CLAUDIA:
Around the wave.

---

Around the wave.

---

Around the -


---

## CLAUDIA:
I’m going to die.

---

## BLAZE:
Claudia, we got some white water coming up, but we’re gonna keep paddling, okay?


---

## CLAUDIA:
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh.

---

## BLAZE:
Claudia! 


---

## CLAUDIA:
Wow.

---

That was a close one. 


---

## CLAUDIA:
Blue house…park bench…Claudia.

---

Blue house…park bench…Claudia.

---

Blue house…park bench…Claudia. 


---

## CLAUDIA:
You’re a very good surfer.

---

## BLAZE:
Thanks. 

---

## CLAUDIA:
People say “those who can’t do teach” but I think that’s completely incorrect.

---

Teaching is much harder than doing.

---

You have to be very good at what you do if you want to explain it to somebody else.

---

There’s nothing harder than people.

---

## BLAZE:
Tell me about it.

---

People are the worst.

---

One time I was teaching this guy and every time I said paddle, he would just jump off his board.

---

## CLAUDIA:
Oh my goodness.

---

## BLAZE:
One time he jumped onto another surfer.

---

It was a mess.

---

I almost got fired.

---

## CLAUDIA:
Have you been teaching surfing for a long time?

---

## BLAZE:
Since I was thirteen.

---

## CLAUDIA:
I started teaching when I was twenty three.

---

Do you teach a lot?

---

## BLAZE:
Every day. 

---

## CLAUDIA:
Wow.

---

How do you find time to study for school? 

---

## BLAZE:
Oh.

---

Yeah.

---

I don’t. 

---

## CLAUDIA:
You don’t study?

---

## BLAZE:
I don’t go to college. 

---

## CLAUDIA:
Oh.

---

## BLAZE:
Yeah.

---

You know. 

---

## CLAUDIA:
No, I certainly do not know.


---

## BLAZE:
It’s complicated. 

---

## CLAUDIA:
What’s complicated? 

---

## BLAZE:
It’s just me and my mom right now, so I can’t, like, be away a lot. 

---

## CLAUDIA:
UC Santa Cruz is only a ten minute drive from here.

---

## BLAZE:
I think it’s, like, fifteen.



---


## CLAUDIA:
When my children graduated high school, we sat down together and came up with a one year plan, a five year plan, and a ten year plan.

---

"Education is the passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today." Malcolm X.

---

## CLAUDIA:
What about surfing? Are you interested in surfing professionally?

---

## BLAZE:
My dad's a professional surfer.

---

## CLAUDIA:
Perfect! So he can help! You know, my son Michael was just telling me that they put surfing in the Olympics now. Isn’t that exciting?

---



## BLAZE:
Did you watch?

---

## CLAUDIA:
Sorry?

---






## BLAZE:
The surfing at the Olympics.

---

Did you watch it?

---

## CLAUDIA:
Georgie and I are more synchronized swimming fans, but I’m sure it was very nice.

---

## BLAZE:
It sucked.

---

They rescheduled four times cause it was too flat.

---

They’re talking about using a wave pool next time.

---

## CLAUDIA:
That’s a clever idea.

---

## BLAZE:
It’s stupid!

---

It’s the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard!

---

## CLAUDIA:
Why is that?

---

## BLAZE:
Because you can’t schedule waves!

---

Waves are alive!

---

The ocean is alive!

---

You can’t program something that’s alive!

---

A real surfer works with whatever waves they get.

---

Even if the wave isn’t perfect.

---

It doesn’t matter.

---

It’s your wave.

---

You have to figure out how it works.

---

It doesn’t matter if there are better waves somewhere else.

---

There are always better waves somewhere else, who gives a shit?

---

This is your wave.

---

Your wave.

---

You don’t abandon it just cause they break bigger in Hawaii.

---

Or cause it’s hard, cause it doesn’t make you look good, cause it’s not want you want.

---

You show up and you figure it out.

---

You show up.

---

You show up.

---

You show up.

---

You show up.

---

You stay.


---

## CLAUDIA:
Are you an Aries? 

---

## BLAZE:
What?

---

## CLAUDIA:
I’m a Taurus, which means I’m patient and responsible, but also a little stubborn.

---

## BLAZE:
I think I’m the fish one.

---

## CLAUDIA:
A Pisces!

---

Like Georgie!

---

Pisces are water signs, which I get for you, less so for Georgie.

---

But Pisces have a hard time confronting reality due to a lack of inner confidence, which is definitely true for Georgie, and maybe that’s true for you too.

---

Is that true for you?

---

## BLAZE:
I mean, I’m good.

---

## CLAUDIA:
Of course you are.

---

You’re young.

---

You have your whole life ahead of you.

---

But what about fifty years from now?

---

Fifty years from now you’re going to want to provide for 
yourself, and your family.

---

For your future.

---

I always tell my students: a life doesn’t happen by chance, it happens by choice.

---

## BLAZE:
I guess I just really have to be with my mom right now.

---

## CLAUDIA:
But sweetie, your mom wants you to succeed and…and well, do you really think you’re going to want to teach surfing for the rest of your life? 


---

## CLAUDIA:
Sweetie, it’s water and a board.

---

Do you really want to throw away your future for water and a board?


---

## GARY:
Eight?

---

## WYNN:
Seven.


---

## GARY:
Six? 

---

## WYNN:
Three.

---

## GARY:
Six!

---

## WYNN:
Two.

---

## GARY:
You, cucaracha, are going blind.

---

## WYNN:
That is the most lopsided ass I’ve seen since Reggie Fairfax took you to prom.


---

## GARY:
Reggie Fairfax.

---

Wow.

---

I haven’t thought about him in decades.

---

## WYNN:
He’s about to turn.

---

Watch the ass.

---

Watch it.

---

Watch.


---

## WYNN:
See?

---

## GARY:
Huh.

---

## WYNN:
Lopsided. 

---

## GARY:
Cockeyed is what it is. 

---

## WYNN:
Ergo three.

---

## GARY:
Ergo one.

---

## WYNN:
Ouch.

---

## GARY:
I don’t have time to waste, baby.

---

If I spy a pickle, I’m crying pickle.


---

## GARY:
Pickle.

---

## WYNN:
Pickle.


---

## GARY:
Oh no, he heard us! 

---

## WYNN:
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT, WATER HOBO?

---

## WYNN:
Aw, he fell off. 

---

## GARY:
This is what I love about being old.

---

You can get away with anything.



---

## GARY:
Hey!

---

Is that Takashi?

---

That guy you dated sophomore year.

---

That guy, the one on the purple board?

---

## WYNN:
Are you referring to that forty-year-old man?


---

## GARY:
Forty??

---

## WYNN:
Besides, it can’t be Takashi.

---

His family just put him in one of those death traps.

---

## GARY:
He’s in hospice?

---

## WYNN:
It’s a regular facility, but what does it matter.

---

Once you’re in, there’s no getting out.

---

And it’s called something absolutely ridiculous.

---

Happy Pines.

---

Good Pines, Very Good Pines, I don’t fucking know.

---

Why are they always naming these places after trees?

---

Have you noticed that?

---

It’s always: come waste the dregs of your life in Glorious Ethereal  Very Nice Plant Land! 

---

## GARY:
You know, they’re not that bad anymore. 


---

## GARY:
They’re not!

---

Some places look so normal you wouldn’t know if it weren’t for all the golf carts. 

---

## WYNN:
They do something to the water, you know.

---

Mix in some kind of low grade arsenic to increase turn-around.

---

## GARY:
That’s not true!

---

## WYNN:
Everybody has to pay rent.

---

## GARY:
They’re trained nurses, not serial killers!

---

## WYNN:
Why are you getting so defensive?

---

You always said you hated those places. 

---

## GARY:
I did!

---

I do!

---

But that was before the fiasco that was my mother.

---

With her stupid fantasy of dying at home like some kind of saint.

---

Only she didn’t account for the fact that she’d live until she was ninety-fucking-eight.

---

Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

---

I almost lost my mind.

---

I swear I almost killed her myself.

---

I had to put bed pans over the carpets because the damn hobgoblin wouldn’t stay put.

---

And when she finally gave in, it was so expensive!

---

Why does dying have to be so expensive?

---

Doesn’t living cost enough? 

---

## WYNN:
That’s why I had my lawyer put a Belgium Clause into my will. 

---

## GARY:
What’s a Belgium clause? 

---

## WYNN:
If I lose my mind and start pissing myself, they are legally obliged to ship me off to Belgium and have me disposed.

---

I’d rather die than have anyone witness my incontinence.

---

## GARY:
They just legalized it in Oregon. 

---

## WYNN:
I don’t trust people from Oregon.

---

## GARY:
Washington too.

---

And Hawaii.

---

That’d be something.

---

Showing up at the pearly gates with a lei around your neck.

---

Saint Peter would shit a brick.


---

## WYNN:
So is that your plan?

---

Go to Hawaii when – if…

---

## GARY:
Yes.


---

## GARY:
No.

---

## GARY:
I don’t know. 


---

## GARY:
I don't think I have the guts.

---

## WYNN:
Claudia told me the new medication was helping.

---

## GARY:
It makes Claudia feel better.


---

## WYNN:
Pierce bought us his-and-her burial plots last year.

---

For my birthday.

---

Guess how much they cost.

---

## GARY:
Four thousand dollars.


---

## WYNN:
Two hundred and ninety.

---

## GARY:
Thousand? 

---

## WYNN:
Each.

---

## GARY:
Oh my god.

---

## WYNN:
It’s an ocean view.

---

## GARY:
For the corpses?

---

## WYNN:
You know Bay Area real estate.

---

## GARY:
If I bought Anika a plot like that, she would garrote me. 

---


## GARY:
Look at that girl.

---

Shit. 

---

## WYNN:
You call that a swimsuit? 

---

## GARY:
Look at her go.

---

## WYNN:
That looks like a thong.

---

## GARY:
Can you believe we used to move like that?

---

## WYNN:
She looks naked.

---

## GARY:
She looks like a goddess.


---

## WYNN:
Pierce cheated on me.

---

## GARY:
Fuck him.

---

## WYNN:
With our golf instructor.

---

## GARY:
Fuck him.

---

## WYNN:
She’s fifty-five.

---

## GARY:
Oh fuck him.

---

## WYNN:
I think I could understand if she was younger.

---

But fifty-five?

---

What the hell am I supposed to do with fifty-five?

---

## GARY:
Has she gone through menopause yet?

---

Because men have a thing about periods.

---

They’re like vampires.  

---

## WYNN:
I could tell right away because he would come home smelling like her.

---

She smelled so fresh, so alive.

---

I smell like the discount shelf at the supermarket.

---

## GARY:
You smell like Chanel.

---

You always smell like Chanel.

---

## WYNN:
I don’t recognize myself anymore.

---

When I look at myself, in the mirror, I think: that can’t be true.

---

That face, that can’t be who I am.

---

It’s like I’m disappearing beneath my wrinkles.

---

## GARY:
I like your wrinkles.

---

## WYNN:
Of course you do.

---

## GARY:
I’m serious!

---

When I see women our age with those smooth doll faces, I get the heebie-jeebies.

---

It’s like meeting an alien.

---

## WYNN:
It’s the neck.

---

You can always tell the age by the neck.


---

## GARY:
But give me a saggy creasy old broad and I’ll show you a woman who’s actually had a life.

---

All these little lines.

---

It’s like a roadmap of my past.

---

Sometimes when it gets bad I trace my face and it calms me down.

---

I remember that I’ve laughed before, and cried.

---

I remember myself.

---

I remember that I have a self.

---

## WYNN:
When I walk down the street now, it’s like I don’t even exist.

---

Men used to gape at me.

---

## GARY:
And I used to do reverse cowgirl, honey.

---

People change.

---

We evolve.

---

## WYNN:
The worst part is not having anyone to sleep next to at night.

---

Pierce and I always slept naked.

---

I loved that.

---

I love feeling a man’s body.

---

The joints of his hips.

---

His arms. His upper thighs.

---

There is something so vulnerable about a man’s upper thigh.

---

It’s like the 
only part of their body that you’re not supposed to see.

---

And then the rest of him is so strong, so big and hairy and sure of itself.

---

When Pierce sleeps at night, his chest heaves 
up and down like he’s some great big hibernating bear.

---

Maybe that’s why I fell for him.

---

I liked knowing that he could wake up and break me into pieces if he wanted to.


---

## WYNN:
I don’t think I’m evolving.

---

## GARY:
What do you mean?

---

## WYNN:
The cowgirl thing. 

---

## GARY:
What cowgirl thing?

---

## WYNN:
Oh my god.

---

## GARY:
What? 

---

## WYNN:
Oh my god.

---

## GARY:
Why are you looking at me like that?

---

## WYNN:
What did you just say?

---

## GARY:
What are you talking about? 

---

## WYNN:
I want you to tell me what you just said.

---

About cowgirls.

---

Just now.

---

## GARY:
Stop looking at me like that!

---

## WYNN:
Gary, what did you just fucking say?

---

## GARY:
Don’t swear at me!

---

## WYNN:
Margaret! 

---

## GARY:
What!

---

## WYNN:
What did you just fucking -


---

## CLAUDIA:
OH MY GOSH!

---

## BLAZE:
CLAUDIA!!

---

## BLAZE:
YES!!
Claudia!

---

Dude, that was amazing! 

---

## CLAUDIA:
I just did what you told me to!

---

I paddled and then I felt the wave and you said UP and I was UP!

---

## BLAZE:
And you’ve really never surfed before?

---

## CLAUDIA:
No, but I do take a water aerobics class on Wednesdays at 2 pm at the Y!

---

## BLAZE:
You’re totally a natural. 

---

## CLAUDIA:
I’ve seen videos of surfers before but I never thought it would feel so amazing!

---

## BLAZE:
Wait till you start standing. 

---

## CLAUDIA:
You really think I could stand?

---

## BLAZE:
With some practice, I don’t see why not.

---

You’ve got a great feel for the wave.

---

## CLAUDIA:
Wow.

---

Wow. 

---

## BLAZE:
Wynn, you ready?

---

We should paddle out now while there’s still a break in the set.

---

## CLAUDIA:
Oh, go for it, Wynnie!

---

It’s so amazing!

---

I’ve never felt so alive in my whole life!



---

## CLAUDIA:
Do you know that song by Simon and Garfunkle?

---

The one that’s like duh-dah-dah-dah-dah sparrow and a snail.

---

## GARY:
“El Condor Pasa”?

---

## CLAUDIA:
“El Condor Pasa,” do you know that song?

---

## GARY:
Yes, Claudia, I also happened to be alive during the seventies. 

---

## CLAUDIA:
It starts with that – it’s guitar, I think – that trembling sound, it’s very delicate, like – 


---

## GARY:
I know the damn song.

---

## CLAUDIA:
I’d rather be a hammer than a nail.

---

That’s a line in the song.

---

I’d rather be hammer than a nail.

---

I’d rather be a hammer than a nail. 

---

## CLAUDIA:
I think I’m the nail.

---

I think all my life I’ve been the nail.


---

## CLAUDIA:
I’m so glad you convinced me to do this, Gary.

---

I know I was against it at first, but this is amazing.

---

I’ve never felt so alive in my whole life!

---

I really feel like this is one of those watershed moments and I’m never going to be the same again!

---

## GARY:
You didn’t even stand.

---

## CLAUDIA:
Sorry?


---

## GARY:
You didn’t stand up.

---

## CLAUDIA:
It was only my first time. 

---

## GARY:
YOU DIDN’T STAND UP! 

---

## CLAUDIA:
Sweetie, is everything -

---

## GARY:
I don’t want to talk to you anymore. 

---

## CLAUDIA:
Gary?

---

Is something -

---

## GARY:
I SAID I DON’T WANT TO TALK!


---

[Claudia starts to sing Surfin' Safari by the Beach Boys. Gary eventually joins in]

---

## CLAUDIA:
Look, sweetie!!

---

We’re finally on our safari!


---

## GARY:
HANG TEN MY DUDES!!


---


## BLAZE:
Okay, we’ve got a good set coming up.

---

## WYNN:
Wait  - 

---

## BLAZE:
Come closer.

---

## WYNN:
I can’t -  

---

## BLAZE:
And scooch back on your board a bit.

---

## WYNN:
I don’t - 


---

## BLAZE:
When I say paddle – 

---

## WYNN:
I don’t want to – stop - 

---

## BLAZE:
That’s when you’re gonna -  

---

## WYNN:
STOP TELLING ME WHAT TO DO!

---

## BLAZE:
Are you okay?

---

## BLAZE:
We don’t have to do this.

---

We can go back to the others if you want. 

---

## WYNN:
I am not going back.



---

## BLAZE:
Uh…

---

## WYNN:
Fuck.

---

## WYNN:
She finished it!

---

She fucking - 

---

## WYNN:
Fuck!!

---


## WYNN:
What?

---

## BLAZE:
That’s just, um.

---

That’s littering.

---

## WYNN:
So sue me.


---

## WYNN:
What?

---

## BLAZE:
Nobody wanted to teach this lesson today.

---

Nobody.

---

And I didn’t get it.

---

Three old ladies?

---

How hard could that be?

---

Oh my god.

---

## WYNN:
I could get you fired for the way you’re speaking to me right now.

---

## WYNN:
I’m serious!

---

## BLAZE:
Okay!

---

Go ahead!

---

That’ll fix everything, right? 

---

## WYNN:
I know your life is a tropical paradise but in the real world, on land, there are these things called consequences, so why don’t you do us both a favor and shut the fuck up.

---

I knew this was bad idea.

---

I told Claudia.

---

What do you think is going happen after spending three on hours on top of a piece of foam?

---

Some kind of goddamn epiphany?

---

I’ll tell you what’s going to happen.

---

I’m going to wake up tomorrow with so many 
bruises on the inside of my thighs that my Pilates instructor will think I fucked a trash compactor.

---

My nose will be sunburnt and I’ll have go to my dermatologist to ensure it isn’t cancerous and that the Botox hasn’t migrated to the side of my neck.

---

Assuming I 
survive this godforsaken afternoon of torture.

---

Assuming I don’t fall off and dislocate my shoulder or break my hip or lacerate my face or sprain my leg or paralyze myself or get bitten or stung or attacked or drowned.

---

God, I hate the ocean! 

---

## WYNN:
Mango Peach Pineapple??

---

I’ve been looking for this flavor everywhere!

---

Where did you find it?

---

## BLAZE:
My friend runs the dispensary on Ocean Street.

---

## WYNN:
Reefside?

---

I went there!

---

They told me they were out.

---

## BLAZE:
Yeah sometimes they hide the best flavors for locals. 

---

## WYNN:
Oh.

---

## BLAZE:
No.

---

You keep it.

---

## WYNN:
Really? 

---

## BLAZE:
I can always get more.

---

## WYNN:
It’s so good.

---

## BLAZE:
I love how the mango kicks in the end.

---

At first you think they forgot it and then – 

---

## WYNN:
Mm.

---

## BLAZE:
There she is.

---

## WYNN:
I’m being greedy.

---

## BLAZE:
I can’t smoke during lessons.

---

## WYNN:
Come on. 

---

## BLAZE:
Like, it’s in my contract. 

---

## WYNN:
Scaredy-cat. 


---

## WYNN:
Did you try the vanilla coffee version they rolled out last year? 

---

## WYNN:
Right? 

---

## BLAZE:
It was so bad. 

---

## WYNN:
At least it wasn’t Buttered Popcorn.

---

Now that was flavor was fatal.

---

## BLAZE:
I liked Buttered Popcorn! 


---

## WYNN:
Give me a break.

---

## BLAZE:
It was really good!

---

## WYNN:
It tasted like airplane.

---

## BLAZE:
It tasted like buttered popcorn!

---

## WYNN:
It tasted like stale pretzels and socks and the little farts people think they can get away with because of the altitude. 

---

## BLAZE:
You’re funny. 

---

## WYNN:
No.

---

Gary’s the funny one. 

---

## BLAZE:
“Because of the altitude.” That’s funny.


---

## WYNN:
You remind me so much of Adrian. 

---

## BLAZE:
Who’s Adrian?

---

## WYNN:
My second husband.

---

He was the good one. 

---

## BLAZE:
You guys still together?


---

## WYNN:
He died.

---

## BLAZE:
Sorry.

---

## WYNN:
Happens to the best of us.

---

## BLAZE:
How old was he?

---

## WYNN:
Twenty-four.

---

He was in an accident.

---

But don’t worry!

---

My next husband had a lot more money so they all lived happily ever after. 

---

## BLAZE:
What’s his name?

---

## WYNN:
He’s also dead.

---

## BLAZE:
I’m sorry.

---

## WYNN:
I’m not.

---

He deserved it.


---

## WYNN:
What does it feel like to surf a wave?

---

I mean actually surf it, not whatever it is we’re paying you to make us do. 

---

## BLAZE:
It’s awesome.

---

## WYNN:
You have to give me more than that, Buttered Popcorn. 


---


## BLAZE:

Have you ever been to Mavericks?

---

## WYNN:
Maverick?

---

## BLAZE:
Mavericks. It’s this wave that breaks out by Half Moon Bay.

---

It can get huge. like forty feet.

---

## WYNN:
Oh my god. 

---

## BLAZE:
My dad used to ride it all the time.

---

When I was 13, he took me out with him.

---

The swell was so massive that day. The waves were like mountains. 

---

Just walls of water, coming up out of nowhere. 

---

We paddled out, and my heart started going like crazy. 

---

My dad kept yelling at me "paddle, paddle, paddle!"

---

But I couldn't move. I was totally frozen. 

---

And then this wave came. And it was... it was so big. And my dad just... pushed me and...

---


The thing about waves is that they don’t actually exist. 

---

They’re just energy moving through water.

---

So when you’re on one, it’s like…you feel that. All that energy.

---

From the bottom of the ocean. From the currents.

---

From ocean trenches and underwater volcanoes and coral reefs.

---

From the sky. From clouds and tornadoes and rain and moonlight. And the stars.

---

When I rode that wave, I swore I felt stars.

---

I felt the whole freaking universe, just in the spray of white water.


---


People call it a surfer’s high but that doesn’t make sense. It’s more like a surfer’s everywhere.


---

Because the energy goes freaking everywhere. So for a second you’re everywhere too.

---

You’re stoked.



---

## WYNN:
Blaze. 

---

## BLAZE:
Yeah?

---

## WYNN:
What’s your real name?

---

## BLAZE:
Thomas. 

---

## WYNN:
How did you end up a Blaze?

---

## BLAZE:
When I was a kid, I used to drop down a wave without turning and my board would carve this streak of white water behind me and my dad always said it looked like a candle’s –

---

## WYNN and BLAZE:
Blaze. 

---

## BLAZE:
Yeah.

---

## WYNN:
So you’re a daddy’s boy. 

---

## BLAZE:
My dad’s a dick. 

---

## WYNN:
Ah.

---

## BLAZE:
And like, I get it.

---

He’s big wave rider and that’s super intense.

---

You have to be really focused.

---

But when my mom got bad, he just freaked and – and – and you just don’t leave someone when they get like that, you know?

---

Just cause it’s messing with your career and stuff.

---

## WYNN:
Do you still see him?

---

## BLAZE:
He has a shaping shop in Oahu now, so.

---

## WYNN:
Right.

---

## BLAZE:
But we talk sometimes.

---

He wants me to come help run the shop.

---

## WYNN:
In Hawaii? 

---

## BLAZE:
Yeah. 

---

## WYNN:
Do you want to go?

---

## BLAZE:
I don’t think I can afford the ticket.

---

## WYNN:
But do you want to?

---

## BLAZE:
I mean, I can’t leave my mom anyway, so it doesn’t really matter.

---

## WYNN:
Do you want to?


---

## WYNN:
Life only happens once.

---

And it goes fast, Thomas.

---

Life goes away so fucking fast.

---

All you can do is hold on.

---

And then you get arthritis. 

---

## WYNN:
Hey.

---

Hey. 

---

## BLAZE:
I think I miss my dad.

---

## WYNN:
Of course you do. 

---

## BLAZE:
He’s an asshole. 

---

## WYNN:
I’m an asshole.

---

It’s not the be-all end-all.

---

## BLAZE:
You’re not an asshole.

---

## WYNN:
You don’t even know me.

---

## BLAZE:
You’re not an asshole.

---

## WYNN:
You don’t know me.


---

## BLAZE:
When I was a kid, my mom used to tell me that currents are made up of souls.

---

That’s why they’re so strong.

---

It’s the force of all of these souls on their way to the next life. 


---

## WYNN:
I can’t feel it. 

---

## BLAZE:
It’s different from the rest of the water.

---

It’s like this burst of cold. 

---

## WYNN:
I can’t feel it.

---

I can’t fucking feel it! 

---

## WYNN:
Oh.



---

## GARY:
(shouting) WAVE, WYNN!

---

## CLAUDIA:
GET IT, WYNNIE!

---

PADDLE, PADDLE, PADDLE!


---

## GARY:
Okay, I’m next!

---

And no dilly-dallying this time.

---

I came here to surf a wave, goddammit. 

---

## BLAZE:
(dazed) What?

---

## GARY:
WAVES!

---

Those curly little things that contain dolphins!

---

## BLAZE:
Oh.

---

Yeah.

---

I don’t know.

---

We should probably start heading back to shore.

---

## GARY:
No!

---

No!

---

My whole life I wanted to be a surfer, ever since I was a little girl!



---

## BLAZE:
Woah, 

---

## GARY:
wait!

---

Wait!

---

This one looks a little big, I think you should wait!

---

## GARY:
CLAUDIA DID IT ON HER FIRST TRY.

---

## CLAUDIA:
COME ON GARY!

---

YOU GOT THIS!

---

 PADDLE!


---

## WYNN:
PADDLE, MOTHERFUCKER!

---

## BLAZE:
GARY, YOU’RE TOO FAR FORWARD!

---

YOUR NOSE IS GONNA – 

---



## CLAUDIA:
Gary?

---

Gary, honey?

---

Gary, sweetie, please say something. 

---

Are you okay? 



---


## CLAUDIA:
What hurts Gare-Bear? Is it your head? 

---

Wynn, come here. 


---

## GARY:
Don’t touch me.

---

## CLAUDIA:
What hurts, Gare-Bear?

---

Is it your head?

---



## GARY:
Who are you?

---

What are you doing?

---

## CLAUDIA:
It’s me, sweetie, it’s us, it’s Claudia and Wynnie.

---

Wynn, would you get over here.

---


## GARY:
No!

---

Don’t touch me!

---

Get away from me!

---

Help! 


---

## BLAZE:
Hey, can I - 

---

## CLAUDIA:
Gary, sweetie, it’s me, it’s Claudia it’s okay. 

---

## GARY:
IF YOU COME ANY CLOSER, I’LL SCREAM.

---

## BLAZE:
Can I - 

---

## CLAUDIA:
Please, honey, please, it’s going to be –

---

## GARY:
NO!

---

GET AWAY!

---

 NO!

---

## CLAUDIA:
Anika’s right on the beach, sweetie.

---

 Wynn, for the love of God.

---

## GARY:
LEAVE ME ALONE! 

---

## BLAZE:
Can I talk to her?

---

## CLAUDIA:
I’m sorry Blaze, but I think it’s time for the lesson to end.

---

## BLAZE:
But – 

---

## CLAUDIA:
I don’t think you understand.

---


## GARY:
She - isn’t well.

---

## BLAZE:
No, no, I know.

---

My mom gets like this too.


---

## BLAZE:
Hi.

---

My name is Blaze.

---

What’s your name?




---

## GARY:
Margaret. 

---

## BLAZE:
Hi, Margaret.

---

It’s good to meet you.

---

I see that you are feeling a little scared and I want to make sure you are okay.

---

Are you feeling okay, Margaret? 


---

## GARY:
I’m wet.

---

## BLAZE:
Yeah.

---

That’s because we’re in the ocean! 

---

## GARY:
I -

---

## GARY:
I’m – 

Whe - where am I?

---

## BLAZE:
You’re at the beach.

---

We’re in Santa Cruz.

---

That’s the Boardwalk over there. 

---

## GARY:
When I was little my mother…when I was – I wanted…when I – my mother used to - when I - I – I – I –


---

## BLAZE:
I see that you are feeling a little bit scared right now.

---

Why don’t we take a deep breath together?

---

In…two, three.

---

Out…two, three.  




---

## BLAZE:
That’s really good, Margaret, you’re doing a really great job.

---

It’s going to be okay.

---

Margaret, we’re going to head back to shore now.

---

Can you paddle with me?

---

## GARY:
No.

---

## BLAZE:
Okay.

---

That’s okay.

---

Can I push your board for you, Margaret?

---

That way you don’t have to paddle, you can just relax and have a good - 

---

## GARY:
No!

---

No.

---

I don’t - I – I – I – I want – I want to – I want to do that.


---

## BLAZE:
You want to go surfing? 

---

## BLAZE:
What if we watch the surfers?

---

That’s a lot of fun.

---

And then -

---

## GARY:
NO!

---

NO!

---

I DON’T WANT - 

---

## BLAZE:
Okay, it’s okay, Margaret.

---

It’s okay.

---

What I’m hearing is that you want to go surfing.

---

Is that right, Margaret?

---

Do you want to go surfing?

---

## BLAZE:
Okay.

---

Can you do one thing for me, though, Margaret?

---

Can you pick two things to look at when you’re on the wave?

---

So that you always know where you are?

---

## BLAZE:
Can you pick two things that won’t move?


---

## BLAZE:
Nice, Margaret.

---

Those are really good choices.

---

Now, when we paddle, we take big, deep strokes to get a lot of power.

---

Can you do that for me?

---

## BLAZE:
That’s really good!

---

You’re a really good paddler, Margaret. 

---

## GARY:
I – I’m a surfer.

---

## BLAZE:
That’s right, Margaret.

---

You’re absolutely a surfer.

---

Come on.

---

Let’s go catch a wave.


---

## WYNN:
She’s lost her mind.

---

## CLAUDIA:
She is going through a temporary episode but she will pull through this and we will keep looking for ways to move forward together.

---

## WYNN:
She’s lost her mind.

---

## CLAUDIA:
Please stop saying that. 

---

## WYNN:
She has lost her fucking mind.

---

## CLAUDIA:
STOP IT!

---

You do not have the right to speak like that!

---

You do not have the right.

---

## WYNN:
You said she was better!

---

## CLAUDIA:
You left. 

---

## WYNN:
What are you talking about?

---

I didn’t leave.


---

## CLAUDIA:
From the day Gary told us what was happening, from that stupid, horrible opera, you vanished.

---

## WYNN:
I’ve been busy.

---

## CLAUDIA:
You’ve been busy.

---

I’ve been busy.

---

We’ve all been busy!

---

But she’s your best friend.

---

You don’t abandon your best friend.

---

## WYNN:
I didn’t – 

---

## CLAUDIA:
You haven’t seen her in two years!

---

## WYNN:
She’s not mad at me!

---

Clearly, she’s moved on!

---

## CLAUDIA:
Of course she’s moved on!

---

All she can do is move on! 

---

## WYNN:
Besides, it’s not like she’s not alone!

---

She has her new girlfriend - 

---

## CLAUDIA:
Caretaker.


---

## WYNN:
Anika is her girlfriend.

---

## CLAUDIA:
Anika is her caretaker.

---

She’s been helping us prepare for the move.

---

## WYNN:
What move? 

---

## CLAUDIA:
To the facility.

---

Didn’t Gary tell you? 

---

## WYNN:

Gary didn’t – 

---

## CLAUDIA:
She’s going on Monday. 

---

## WYNN:
What? 

---

## CLAUDIA:
Her mental lapses are becoming too frequent.

---

Soon she’ll need round-the-clock care.

---

## WYNN:
But – she’s taking new medicine!

---

You said –

---

## CLAUDIA:
It makes her feel better.

---

You know Gary.

---

She always needs to feel like she’s doing something.

---

## WYNN:
But -

---

## CLAUDIA:
This is Gary’s choice, Wynn.


---

## CLAUDIA:
What are you doing?

---

Where are you going?

---

Wynn!

---

Where are you going?

---

## WYNN:
I can’t do this.

---

I can’t - 

---



## CLAUDIA 
What about me?

---

## WYNN:
What?

---

## CLAUDIA:
What about me, Wynn?

---

What about me?

---

## WYNN:
What’s wrong with you?

---

## CLAUDIA:
Why do you never think about me?


---

## CLAUDIA:
There’s nobody left once Gary goes.

---

Georgie’s getting clumsier by the day, it’s only a matter of time before something happens, and and meanwhile, 

---

here I am, trying to call you like a damn fool just so I can have somebody to talk to, so I can hear a voice that isn’t the one in my head, and I’m sick of it!

---

I’m sick of being the only person who tries, who cares, because nobody cares about me, nobody cares about how I’m feeling!

---

Stupid, silly, little Claudia, let’s just leave her alone because she’s capable, she can take it, she won’t fuss, and everything is happening so fast and I – I just discovered that I can surf!

---

I didn’t know I could do that and what if there are other things I can do but I won’t have the time to figure it out? 

---

## WYNN:
There’s time.

---

## CLAUDIA:
How do you how know much time we get?

---

How do you know that?

---

## CLAUDIA:
You can leave Pierce.

---

You can leave Gary.

---

But you can’t leave me.

---

Because I can’t do it without you.

---

I need you.

---

So you have to stay.

---

Promise me you’ll stay.

---

## WYNN:
Claudia. 

---

## CLAUDIA:
Promise me right now. 

---

## WYNN:
I’ll try.

---

## CLAUDIA:
WINIFRED, YOU HAVE TO PROMISE.

---

## BLAZE:
So when the wave comes, you’re going to paddle nice and deep and slow, okay?


---

## BLAZE:
The most important thing is to look where you want to go.

---

Do you think you can do that for me?


---

## BLAZE:
I think you can too. 


---

## BLAZE:
Okay, Margaret.

---

There’s a wave coming.

---

Are you ready? 

---

## GARY:
I’m ready.

---

## BLAZE:
Okay, start paddling.

---

Awesome, Margaret.

---

Just like that.

---

I’m going to push you now, okay?

---

Are you ready?

---

On three…one, two, three!


---

## BLAZE:
You got this, Margaret!


---

## CLAUDIA:
YOU’RE  DOING GREAT, HONEY!

---

YOU LOOK SO BEAUTIFUL!


---

## WYNN:
YOU GOT THIS, BABY!


---

## BLAZE:
THAT’S AWESOME, MARGARET!

---

YOU’RE DOING A GREAT JOB!

---

## GARY:
Look!

---
