JEEVES INTERVENES<br>
by Margaret Raether
---
---

## JEEVES:
Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to First Folio Theater and this evening’s production of Jeeves Intervenes.

---

We are pleased that you are able to join us and have just a few reminders for your visit to Mr. Wooster’s home.

---

 
First, we do ask that you leave your masks on throughout the performance and whilst inside the facilities here at the Peabody Estate.

---


Further, the taking of photographs, whether with a Kodak Autographic Camera, one of Mr. Eastman’s devices, or your mobile device, is strictly prohibited.

---

 
Also, I would kindly ask that you turn off your mobile phones, watches and any other which-it who’s-it devices you may have on your person.

---

Interrupting the performance would be most impolite.

---

I sincerely hope you enjoy the show.

---

## JEEVES:
Good morning, sir.

---

## BERTIE:
(mutters incoherently)

---

## JEEVES:
Quite so, sir.

---

I have taken the liberty of mixing a little preparation of my own invention which proves quite efficacious at moments such as these.

---

## BERTIE:
(a horrid garglng sound)

---

## JEEVES:
Just so, sir.

---

## BERTIE:
By Jove —! Jeeves, old thing, you are one of the wonders of the world!

---

## JEEVES:
One does endeavor to give satisfaction, sir.

---

## BERTIE:
I don’t suppose one could enquire—

---

## JEEVES:
I’m terribly sorry, sir.

---


## BERTIE:
No, no.

---

Of course not.

---

## JEEVES:
I’m not at liberty to divulge the contents, sir.

---

## BERTIE:
Secrets of the guild and all that—

---

## JEEVES:
Precisely, sir.

---

## BERTIE:
No doubt about it, Jeeves, that pick-me-up of yours would produce results in anything short of an Egyptian mummy! 

---

Mind you, for just a touch there, I felt as though someone had touched off a bomb inside the old bean.

---

But now the sun shines, the birds are a- twitter, and, generally speaking, hope dawns once more.

---

## JEEVES:
As you say, sir.

---

## BERTIE:
I don’t mind confessing to you, Jeeves, that the lads and I were making a bit merry at the dear old Drones Club last night.

---

## JEEVES:
I had surmised as much, sir.

---

## BERTIE:
It was Freddie Widgeon’s notion – indoor polo.

---

No need to fuss about the weather or the state of the ponies.

---

Just saddle up the old broomsticks, trusty English umbrellas for mallets and whack away in the dining room.

---

## JEEVES:
Most ingenious, sir.

---

## BERTIE:
Mind you, it takes the very keenest sort of concentration to make a tricky shot what with the other lads chucking dinner rolls at one.

---

## JEEVES:
It would seem a most daunting task.

---

## BERTIE:
I should say so.

---

Still, we were in high spirits.

---


One last jolly go before yours truly is compelled to bid farewell to the delights of town and motor down to the country to do the old family obligatory.

---

Relations do play havoc with one’s social life, eh, Jeeves?

---

## JEEVES:
So it would seem, sir.

---

By any chance, was there a costume contest at the Club as well?

---

## BERTIE:
What?

---

## JEEVES: 
I was seeking some sort of explanation for… this, sir.

---

## BERTIE:

That? That’s my new cummerbund!

---

## JEEVES:
I beg your pardon, sir?

---

## BERTIE:
You heard me, Jeeves.

---

I won it in a wager from Pongo Twistleton.

---

I intend to start a new fashion trend.

---

What do you think?

---

## JEEVES:
I did think that perhaps the circus was in town.

---

## BERTIE:
Now see here, Jeeves, there’s no use going all frosty on me.

---

I intend to keep and wear that cummberbund; it is the last word in fashion!

---

## JEEVES:
The very last word, sir.

---

## BERTIE:
The Woosters are noted for their amiable disposition, but as the last of the Woosters, I feel compelled to take a stand vis a vis that cummberbund, Jeeves.

---

Jeeves? Are you there?

---

## JEEVES:
Sir?

---

## BERTIE:
Jeeves, I cannot help but observe that there has been a distinct frost on the upper slopes for several days now.

---

## JEEVES:
I’m terribly sorry, sir.

---

## BERTIE:
I hope that you are not sulking about our trip to the South of France?

---

## JEEVES:
No indeed, sir.

---

I have put it from my mind entirely.

---

## BERTIE:
After all, it’s hardly my fault that we were forced to cancel! Well, actually, I suppose it is my fault.

---

But not, if you follow me, in way for which I could actually be faulted.

---

## JEEVES:
I’m not entirely certain that I follow, sir.

---

## BERTIE:
It’s her.

---

You know who I mean.

---

## JEEVES:
Are you, by any chance, referring to Mrs. Spencer-Gregson?

---

## BERTIE:
The very same.

---

My cursed Aunt Agatha, she who chews broken bottles.

---

She who kills rats with her teeth.

---

## JEEVES:
Yes, I have observed, sir, that Mrs. Spencer Gregson is a woman of very forceful character.

---

## BERTIE:
Forceful doesn’t begin to cover it, Jeeves.

---

One moment you and I are booked for Cannes to spend a jolly holiday on the jolly old Riviera.

---

The next moment, Aunt Agatha buttonholes me for two minutes and I find myself clasped to the iron bosom of my family.

---

Forced, mind you, forced to forgo the Riviera and instead to put in a command appearance with my nearest and dearest.

---

Worthy people, of course.

---

Virtuous, upright… dreary beyond belief.

---

You can see why I was imbibing rather freely last night.

---

From jolly Riviera to dreary country estate.

---

It’s tragic, really.

---

## JEEVES:
As you say, sir.

---

## BERTIE:
The thing is, when Aunt Agatha wants you to do a thing you do it, or else you find yourself wondering why those fellows in olden days 

---

made such a fuss about a paltry thing like the Spanish Inquisition.

---

And, mind you, I know what she’s up to with all this family togetherness nonsense.

---

## JEEVES:
I did wonder if she had a matrimonial prospect in view for you, sir.

---

## BERTIE:
The woman’s obsessed with marrying me off.

---

It was only last week that she wrinkled her nose at me as if I were a drain that had gone bad, 

---

and then, Jeeves, then ordered me to pay particular attention to the Honourable Gertrude Winklesworth-Bode.

---

Oh, I see what she’s planning.

---

## JEEVES:
One does wonder if the Riviera might not have been the more prudent course of action, sir.

---

## BERTIE:
Of course it would, but one glance from Aunt Agatha’s Evil Eye and my will is paralyzed.

---

Paralyzed!
I rely on you to steer me safely through these troubled waters, Jeeves.

---

## JEEVES:
I shall certainly do my utmost sir.

---

I am acquainted very slightly with the young lady in question and I fear that she would not suit, sir.

---

## BERTIE:
Of course she wouldn’t.

---

The prospect doesn’t bear thinking of.

---

We'd be known by as Bertie and Gertie.

---

Like some dashed musical act.

---

But wait, how do you know her, Jeeves?

---

## JEEVES:
A niece of mine walks out with the undergardener of Miss Winklesworth-Bode’s guardian, Lord Worplesby.

---

## BERTIE:
It beats me how you always know everything about everyone.

---

## JEEVES:
Miss Winklesworth-Bode, I fear, could not be characterized as popular with the staff.

---

She appears to be a very… improving sort of person.

---

Her efforts are well meant, no doubt.

---

## BERTIE:
No doubt, But, by and large, people don’t wish to be improved!

---

## JEEVES:
It can be a rather daunting undertaking.

---

## BERTIE:
I have an ominous foreboding that she views me as her next project.

---

Just have a gander at this book Gertie lent me! I mean, look at the title, Jeeves: Types of Ethical Theory.

---

## JEEVES:
Dear me.

---

## BERTIE:
And just listen! The postulate or common understanding involved in speech is certainly co-extensive, 
---

in the obligation it carries, with the social organism of which language is the instrument, and the ends of which it is an effort to subserve.

---

All perfectly true, no doubt, but I ask you, Jeeves, what sort of thing is that to spring on a fellow?

---

## JEEVES:
It does seem a trifle obscure.

---

## BERTIE:
It does indeed! The girl’s a menace.

---

Still she does have a very fetching profile…

---

## JEEVES:
Given your feelings, sir, one cannot help but question the wisdom of the forthcoming visit.

---

## BERTIE:
Yes, I know, but there is no saying “no” to Aunt Agatha, a woman who gladly wears barbed wire next to her skin! 
---
Let us speak no more of it, Jeeves.

---

To the country we must and shall go.

---

## JEEVES:
As you say, sir.

---

## BERTIE:
To the various relations we shall converse politely.

---

## JEEVES:
Very good, sir.

---

## BERTIE:
To the honourable Gertrude Winklesworth-Bode we shall not propose marriage!

---

## JEEVES:
No, sir.

---

## BERTIE:
You can lead a horse to the altar, Jeeves, but you cannot make it wed!

---

## JEEVES:
Well put, sir.

---

## BERTIE:
If Aunt Agatha thinks I'm going to wait around while she and Gertie lead me trussed, stuffed, 
---
and garnished with lemon to the altar, she's got several more thinks coming!

---

## BERTIE:
I have made my decision, Jeeves! Yes, sir.

---

## BERTIE:
You must hold me to it, Jeeves, at all costs.

---

## JEEVES:
I shall do my very best, sir.

---

## BERTIE:
Thank heaven I don’t have to cope with any of that until tomorrow when we motor down to the country.

---

I refuse to give it another thought.

---

Here I am, without a care in the world, without a relation in sight! 
---

As some poetical Johnnie once said, “Eat drink and be merry— something something something…”

---

## JEEVES:
A message for you, sir.

---

## BERTIE:
Oh yes? Excellent! I’ll wager it’s from Gussie Fink-Nottle.

---

You remember him, Jeeves, the one who— oh, Good Lord! Jeeves!

---

## JEEVES:
Sir?

---

## BERTIE:
We’re in the soup! She’s here.

---

Come to town!

---

## JEEVES:
She, sir?

---

## BERTIE:
Aunt Agatha! In London! Some nonsense about shopping.

---

“I shall expect you to be at home as I shall be dropping by at some point.

---

By the way — and right here is where she gets down to brass tacks, Jeeves! — Gertrude Winklesworth-Bode will be accompanying me.

---

Such a charming girl.

---

I know you two will have much to discuss.” Did you ever hear a more sinister threat?

---

## JEEVES:
Does she indicate a time, sir?

---

## BERTIE:
She’s too devious for that.

---

Jeeves, I am not at home!

---

## JEEVES:
No, sir.

---

## BERTIE:
I have not been home.

---

Spent the night at my club.

---

Never received this note.

---

## JEEVES:
Indeed, sir.

---

## BERTIE:
You haven’t seen me! No notion what’s become of me!

---

## JEEVES:
It shall be as a dark mystery, sir.

---

## EUSTACE:
Where is he?

---

## JEEVES:
I regret, sir, that Mr. Wooster is not at home.

---

## EUSTACE:
Not at home! 

---

## JEEVES:
No, sir.

---

## EUSTACE:
But he must be! He never stirs out before noon.

---

Bertie!

---

## JEEVES:
I’m terribly sorry, sir.

---

I fear he has inexplicably vanished.

---

## BERTIE:
Bassy? 

---

## EUSTACE:
Bertie!

---

## JEEVES:
Ah, he has reappeared.

---

What a shock.

---

Mr. Eustace Bassington-Bassington.

---

May I take your hat, sir?

---

## EUSTACE:
Thank you, Jeeves.

---

Terribly sorry to barge past you like that.

---

## JEEVES:
Think nothing of it, sir.

---

## BERTIE:
Dash it, Bassy, I can’t see you now.

---

I’m making a run for it!

---

## EUSTACE:
I understand.

---

Just popped by to say good-bye before drowning myself in the Thames.

---

## BERTIE:
What? You’re doing what?

---

## EUSTACE:
I can see I’ve come at a bad time.

---

I’ll go now.

---

## BERTIE:
What are you blathering about, you ass?

---

## EUSTACE:
I may be an ass, but at least I’m not a silly ass!

---

## BERTIE:
You are!

---

## EUSTACE:
No, you are!

---

## JEEVES:
If that will be all, sir.

---


## EUSTACE:
No, don’t go, Jeeves.

---

## BERTIE:
Yes, do stay.

---

I expect Bassy wants your advice.

---

## EUSTACE:
Yes, well, after all Bertie— Jeeves is, in a manner of speaking, the brains of the family.

---

No offense.

---

## BERTIE:
None taken.

---

You’re quite right.

---

Oh well, have a seat and out with it.

---

But, make it quick, mind you.

---

I’m expecting a fire-breathing dragon on my doorstep at any moment.

---

## EUSTACE:
Sorry, what?

---

## BERTIE:
My Aunt Agatha is on her way.

---

Probably polishing up her hatchet this very moment.

---

## JEEVES:
If one might enquire as to the nature of Mr. Bassington-Bassington’s dilemma?

---

## BERTIE:
Yes, Bassy, what’s driven you to drown yourself this time? Not in love again, I hope?

---

## EUSTACE:
Certainly not! I told you, Bertie, I’ve sworn off the fair sex forever.

---

## BERTIE:
What utter rot.

---


## EUSTACE: 
It’s not!

---

## BERTIE:
It is! If all the girls you have loved were placed end to end — not that I suppose that would be easy to do — they would reach half way to Piccadilly.

---

## EUSTACE:
Further than that, I expect.

---

Some of them were pretty tall.

---

## JEEVES:
One hesitates to interrupt the mathematical speculation, but am I to understand that the problem is romantic in nature?

---

## EUSTACE:
No, I tell you! It’s that…other matter, Jeeves.

---

## JEEVES:
Ah.

---

## BERTIE:
What other matter? What’s going on? 

---

## EUSTACE:
Look, Bertie, I’ve got this Uncle.

---

## BERTIE:
Yes, well, I know how that goes.

---

I’ve got this Aunt.

---

## EUSTACE:
Yes, but we are now talking about me.

---

It’s my mother’s eldest brother, Sir Rupert Watlington-Pipps.

---

## JEEVES:
Unfortunately, Mr. Bassington-Bassington is financially dependent upon his uncle.

---

## EUSTACE:
Yes, he supplies me with the allowance that allows me to live like a prince in London.

---

## BERTIE:
What piffle.

---

You live like an absolute pauper!

---

## EUSTACE:
I was being ironic.

---

## BERTIE:
Well, stop that! It confuses me.

---

So, I take it Sir Rupert is a bit of a skinflint?

---

## EUSTACE:
The old blighter would walk ten miles in the snow to chisel an orphan out of tuppence.

---

## BERTIE:
Ah.

---

## EUSTACE:
And he has the most bizarre ideas about making a man out of me.

---

## BERTIE:
Good luck to that!

---

## EUSTACE:
Exactly! He’s been threatening to send me to India to learn the jute business from the bottom up.

---

## BERTIE:
Good heavens!

---

## EUSTACE:
I haven’t any real notion what the jute business is, but I definitely do not want to be at the bottom of it.

---

## BERTIE:
I should think not.

---

The mind positively reels!

---

## EUSTACE:
Still, Uncle Rupert was most insistent.

---

So, I asked myself, “What would Bertie do?”

---

## BERTIE:
Did you? 

---

## EUSTACE:
And then… I did it.

---

## BERTIE:
…What?

---

## JEEVES:
Mr. Bassington-Bassington came to me for advice.

---

## BERTIE:
Of course he did.

---

## EUSTACE:
I would have come to you for advice, Bertie, but, you know, what good would that do?
---

I mean, you are a fairly consummate chump, after all.

---

Not that I want to hurt your feelings.

---

## BERTIE:
No, no, I see that.

---

## EUSTACE:
So I thought I’d just put it to Jeeves.

---

## BERTIE:
Right.

---

And Jeeves, no doubt concocted a brilliant scheme of some sort.

---

## EUSTACE:
He did! 

---

## BERTIE:
Jeeves is a wonder!

---

## EUSTACE:
A marvel.

---

What a brain!

---

## BERTIE:
At least a nine and three-quarters.

---

But, then, he does eat a lot of fish.

---

Well, Jeeves, out with it! What did you advise?

---

## JEEVES:
Well, sir, it did occur to me that if Sir Rupert were convinced that Mr. Bassington-Bassington was making a brilliant success here in London, 
---
he — Sir Rupert, that is — might forgo his plan to send the young man to India.

---

## BERTIE:
A brilliant success? At what?

---

## EUSTACE:
Oh, you know, business of some sort.

---

## BERTIE:
Have you gone into business?

---

## EUSTACE:
Of course I haven’t gone into business.

---

What are you on about? What I did was write a lot of letters chock full of lies to Uncle Rupert.

---

## BERTIE:
Oh, well, that’s all right then.

---

## EUSTACE:
No, it’s not all right.

---

There has been… a development.

---

## JEEVES:
Oh, dear.

---

Is there to be, by any chance, a visitation?

---

## EUSTACE:
Yes! Uncle Rupert is coming to London to visit his successful nephew.

---

## BERTIE:
And once he sees that fourth floor walk-up above the chemist shop that you call home—

---

## EUSTACE:
Good-bye, London and jolly times.

---

Hello, India and jute.

---

## BERTIE:
You are in the soup.

---

## EUSTACE:
Hence my decision to drown myself.

---

## BERTIE:
Nonsense! Buck up! So, you’re in a pickle.

---

Well, that happens.

---

Certainly happens to me.

---

## JEEVES:
With remarkable frequency.

---


## BERTIE:
There’s only one thing to be done.

---


## EUSTACE:
What?

---

## BERTIE:
We shall leave it to Jeeves.

---

## JEEVES:
Of course, one doesn’t like to put oneself forward, however, if I might suggest a course of action?

---

## EUSTACE:
Yes, do.

---

## BERTIE:
Suggest away, Jeeves.

---

## JEEVES:
Sir Rupert has been corresponding with you at your place of business?

---

## EUSTACE:
Birnham and Fortescue.

---


## BERTIE:
Yes.

---

Where?

---

## EUSTACE:
Gracie Birnham and Bootsie Fortescue.

---

You know them.

---

## BERTIE:
Aren’t those the two girls who do that juggling act at the Variety Theatre?

---

## EUSTACE:
Terribly jolly girls.

---

They’ve been very sporting about letting me collect my post at their flat.

---

## BERTIE:
I must say, Bassy, I had no idea you had such a flair for skullduggery.

---

## JEEVES:
However, Sir Rupert will naturally expect to stay with you at your home.

---

## BERTIE:
Which he will expect to be some very posh sort of digs in Mayfair or some such.

---

## EUSTACE:
Um, yes.

---

That is what he will expect.

---

## JEEVES:
Then, sir, a respectable flat in Mayfair is what is required.

---

## BERTIE:
Yes, well, where are you — No! Absolutely not.

---

I’m sorry for your trouble, but no.

---

## EUSTACE:
Right.

---

Right.

---

Well then, I’m off to the river.

---

## BERTIE:
Oh, don’t be daft.

---

At least, not more than you can help.

---

When does the old prune arrive?

---

## EUSTACE:
Tomorrow.

---

Do you mean—?

---

## BERTIE:
Yes, of course.

---

Go pack your things.

---

You can move in here and pretend this is your place.

---

Temporarily, mind you.

---

A few days at most!

---

## EUSTACE:
Bertie, I am forever in your debt!

---

## BERTIE:
Yes, you bally well are.

---

You’d better wire your uncle this address.

---

## EUSTACE:
Done.

---


## BERTIE:
What?

---

## EUSTACE:
That is—

---

## BERTIE:
Oh, I see.

---

You and Jeeves had already fixed this up between you!

---

## EUSTACE:
Well, I—

---

## BERTIE:

“I’m just off to drown myself in the Thames” indeed! I have been grossly deceived.

---

## JEEVES:
I was quite certain your loyalty would prompt you to aid your friend in his difficulties.

---

## BERTIE:
You know, Jeeves, I don’t mean to sound critical, I would appreciate being consulted before you sublet my flat.

---

Just a thought.

---

I mean, where am I supposed to stay?

---

## JEEVES:
One had hoped, the Riviera, sir.

---

However, even with our forced change in plans, we shall have departed London by the time Mr. Bassington-Bassington takes up residence.

---

## EUSTACE:
It really is awfully sporting of you to let Uncle Rupert and I stay here, Bertie.

---

I can’t tell you how grateful I am.

---

How soon can you get out?

---

## BERTIE:
Tomorrow, if that’s quite convenient.

---

## EUSTACE:
Perfect! As long as you’re gone before noon.

---

That’s when Uncle’s train arrives.

---

## BERTIE:
There shouldn’t be any difficulty, as Jeeves and I are off to the country to stay with my blasted relatives.

---

Jeeves, you did cancel our reservations for Cannes?

---

## JEEVES:
I shall regretfully do so at the very earliest opportunity, sir.

---

## BERTIE:
Blasted relatives.

---

Relatives! Bassy, you rotter! 

---

## EUSTACE:
What did I do?

---

## BERTIE:
You delayed my getaway!

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
Bertram! 

---

## EUSTACE:
I should go—

---

## BERTIE:
Stand by me, coward!

---

## JEEVES:
Mrs. Spencer-Greg—

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
He knows who I am.

---

Bertram Wilbeforce Wooster!

---

## BERTIE:
Aunt Agatha! What a delightful surprise!

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
Are you completely hen-witted? Did I or did I not write, telling you to expect me?

---

## BERTIE:
That’s right, you did! Of course, you did.

---

And here you are! What, ho! What, ho! What, ho!

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
Do try not to be an ass, Bertram.

---


## GERTRUDE:
Hullo, Bertie.

---

## BERTIE:
I’m sorry.

---

Aunt Agatha, Gertrude, may I present Mr. Eustace Bassington-Bassington, an old school chum of mine.

---

Eustace, I should like you to meet my Aunt, Mrs. Spencer Gregson, and this is the Honourable Gertrude Winklesworth-Bode.

---

## GERTRUDE:
How do you do.

---

## EUSTACE:
(gibberish)

---

## GERTRUDE:
I beg your pardon?

---

## BERTIE:
Pull yourself together, Bassy.

---

Do sit down, everyone.

---

Anywhere at all…

---

[uncomfortable silence]

---

Well, isn’t this jolly? That’s what this is… jolly.

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
Tell me, Mr. Bassington-Bassington, to what branch of the family do you belong?

---

## BERTIE:
Bassy! What branch?

---

## EUSTACE:
Nana smoo.

---

Thanks just the same.

---

## BERTIE:
…Right.

---

Jeeves?

---

## JEEVES:
Sir?

---

## BERTIE:
Know any Bassington-Bassingtons?

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
Of course he doesn’t.

---

Don’t be ridiculous, Bertram.

---

## JEEVES:
I am acquainted with three branches of the Bassington-Bassington family, sir, the Shropshire Bassington-Bassingtons, 
---
the Hampshire Bassington-Bassingtons, and the Kent Bassington-Bassingtons.

---

## BERTIE:
Jeeves knows everything.

---

## GERTRUDE:
How extraordinary.

---

## BERTIE:
Isn’t it? So.

---

England seems pretty well stocked up with Bassington-Bassingtons.

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
Indeed.

---

## BERTIE:
No chance of a sudden shortage, what? Right… May I offer you something, Aunt Agatha? Gertie?

---

## GERTRUDE:
Nothing, thank you.

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
Dear Gertrude and I are just up for the day to do some shopping.

---

## GERTRUDE:
We’re at Brown’s Hotel for the night, then back to the country on the morning train.

---

## BERTIE:
I see.

---

Well…what fun!

---

## GERTRUDE:
I understand you will be joining the family get-together.

---

Perhaps we could all travel down together!

---

## BERTIE:
Yes, that would be… I mean, absolutely… I’m not precisely sure what my plans are as yet…

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
We can settle all that at tea.

---


## BERTIE: 
Tea?

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
Tea.

---

Tea.

---

Don’t sit there with your mouth opening and closing like a fish, Bertram.

---

We cannot stay just at present, but, having ascertained that you are indeed at home, we shall return for tea this afternoon.

---

## BERTIE:
This afternoon?

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
At four o’clock.

---

Sharp.

---

Gertrude, dear, I require a brief word with Bertram.

---

There is a very fine view of the park from the dining room.

---

Perhaps you could show it to Mr. Bassington-Bassington.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Of course.

---

Shall we take in the view, Mr. Bassington-Bassington?

---

## EUSTACE:
What? Oh, yes!

---

## GERTRUDE:
Oh! Are you all right?

---

## EUSTACE:
Perfectly! Rather! Just— you know— for a moment there— but now— indeed! Ha, ha!

---

## EUSTACE:
I do beg your pardon.

---

## BERTIE:
He’s… just a bit— 

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
He certainly is!

---

## BERTIE:
Well, Aunt Agatha, what—

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
Bertram, I shall come straight to the point.

---

It is high time you were breeding.

---

## BERTIE:
…I beg your pardon?

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
As the last of the Woosters, heaven help us, it is your sacred duty to carry on the Wooster name.

---

## BERTIE:
But surely—

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
I am a great believer in bloodlines, Bertram.

---

And it is clear to me that the Wooster blood has become dangerously thin.

---

## BERTIE:
It’s not in the least thin.

---

Possibly even verging upon fat!

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
I don't know what you're talking about, and I don't for a moment suppose you do, either.

---

The Wooster blood has thinned, I say, thinned to have produced a spineless invertebrate like you.

---

Steps must be taken.

---

## BERTIE:
But I don’t want to take steps!

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
Kindly do not talk drivel.

---

It is high time that you brought matters with dear Gertrude to a satisfactory conclusion.

---

## BERTIE:
I hate to disappoint you, Aunt—

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
It is your destiny to disappoint me, Bertram.

---

It is young men like youreself who make a person like myself, with the future of the realm at heart, despair.

---

Cursed with too much money, too little character, and virtually no brain whatsoever.

---

## BERTIE:
I’ll have you know—

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
What you require is someone with sufficient strength of mind to counteract the deficiencies of your own character.

---

Dear Gertrude is such a person.

---

She will mold you, Bertram.

---

## BERTIE:
But I don’t want to be molded! I’m not a jelly!

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
That, Bertram, is a matter of opinion.

---

## BERTIE:
See here, you can’t just order me to marry… can you?

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
Can’t I? (bellowing) Gertrude! Come, dear, it is high time that we departed.

---

## BERTIE:
But Aunt—

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
We’ll settle all this at tea.

---

This afternoon.

---

At four.

---

You may instruct your keeper to make preparations.

---

## BERTIE:
My—

---

## GERTRUDE:
She means Jeeves, of course.

---

She always refers to him as your keeper.

---

Isn’t that just killing?

---

## BERTIE:
Killing.

---


## AUNT AGATHA: 
Jeeves.

---


## JEEVES:
Madam?

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
Miss Winklesworth-Bode and I are taking tea with Bertram this afternoon at four.

---

I require cucumber sandwiches.

---

No crusts.

---

And Oolong tea.

---

Not Black, not Green, not Darjeeling— Oolong.

---

Is that quite clear?

---

## JEEVES:
Quite, madam.

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
You may see me to the door.

---

Gertrude, say your farewells to Bertram and his… poor afflicted friend.

---

## GERTRUDE:
She means to give us a moment alone.

---

…More or less.

---

Isn’t she sweet?

---

## BERTIE:
Sweet! I’ll have you know, that woman is strongly suspected of turning into a werewolf at the full moon!

---

## GERTRUDE:
Oh, Bertie, you are such a tease!

---

## BERTIE:
I assure you, I was never more in earnest.

---

She’s known far and wide as the Nephew Crusher!

---

## GERTRUDE:
Stop it, you naughty boy, or I shall be in the whoops! 

---

Oh, Bertie, dear, you’ve been reading my book!

---

## BERTIE:
What? Oh, yes! Can’t put it down.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Splendid! When you’ve finished, we’ll have a lovely long discussion about it.

---

And then, I think, it will be high time to start you in on Nietzche.

---

## BERTIE:
What?

---

## GERTRUDE:
Nietzche.

---


## BERTIE: 
Gesundheit.

---


## GERTRUDE:
What?

---

## BERTIE: 
Did you sneeze?

---

## GERTRUDE:
Oh, you naughty boy! 

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
Gertrude!

---

## GERTRUDE:
Oh dear, must run! See you at tea.

---

It was lovely to meet you, Mr. Bassington-Bassington.

---

## EUSTACE:
(Gibberish)

---

## GERTRUDE:
Er, yes.

---

Just so.

---

(affectionately) Ta, Bertie!

---

## BERTIE:
Have you gone totally bonkers? What the devil is wrong with you?

---

## EUSTACE:
I have seen a vision.

---

A goddess! 

---

## BERTIE:
Are you completely off your onion?

---

## EUSTACE:
A goddess, I say.

---

And having seen her, I needs must worship.

---

## BERTIE:
I needs must give you a swift boot up the backside.

---

Now look, Bassy, I know how susceptible you are, but I absolutely forbid you to go ga-ga about Gert-the-Flirt Winklesworth-Bode.

---

Do you hear me?

---

## EUSTACE:
Gertrude, oh, dearest Gertrude.

---

You begin where Helen of Troy left off!

---

## BERTIE:
Bassy, we are in the midst of a crisis! Get hold of yourself!

---

## EUSTACE:
Do you think I made any sort of impression at all?

---

## BERTIE:
Yes, I think one could safely say that you made a sort of impression.

---

## EUSTACE:
I know I didn’t say much—

---

## BERTIE:
But what you did say was eloquent.

---

## EUSTACE:
— however it seemed to me that there was a kind of unspoken communion of souls.

---

## BERTIE:
What utter rot!

---

## EUSTACE:
There was a kind of look in her eye.

---

## BERTIE:
Yes, I know that look.

---

Like a sergeant-major.

---

## EUSTACE:
Bertie, I don’t expect you to understand as you have no soul, but there is a language of love that transcends mere sordid words.

---

## BERTIE:
Oh, go boil your head.

---

Jeeves! Oh.

---

## JEEVES:
I thought perhaps I ought to assist Mr. Bassington-Bassinton in packing for his forthcoming visit.

---

## BERTIE:
Unquestionably.

---

The poor loon has gone completely barmy.

---

Bassy, listen to me, I know that Gertrude is a very lively, attractive girl and all that—

---

## EUSTACE:
Bertie, I am in love! It struck me all of a sudden, like a bolt from the blue, like—

---

## BERTIE:
Like a speeding train on track nine, yes.

---

Got it.

---

The thing is, Gertie is the sort of girl who expects a fellow to carve out a career and what not.

---

I know for a fact that I’ve heard her speak favourably of Napoleon.

---

## EUSTACE:
Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? Thou art more lovely and more temperate:

---

## BERTIE:
Bassy, your Uncle Rupert will be here tomorrow.

---

Un-lovely, un-temperate Uncle Rupert.

---

## EUSTACE:
Rough winds do — something something — buds of May, And summer's — something — hath too short a date.

---

## BERTIE:
Jeeves, we’ve lost him.

---

## JEEVES:
Mr. Shakespeare, sir.

---

The sonnets.

---

## BERTIE:
Ah, I thought it was one of those poetical Johnnies.

---

(soothingly) Here we go, Eustace.

---

Go with Jeeves.

---

## EUSTACE:
You’ve got to put in a good word for me, Bertie!

---

## BERTIE:
What, with Gertrude?

---

## EUSTACE:
Yes, Yes! You may not have realized, but I was just a trifle tongue-tied when first we met.

---

## BERTIE:
I didn’t notice.

---

## EUSTACE:
Speak for me, Bertie.

---

You’re clever.

---

## BERTIE:
Compared to you, I’m one of the ten great minds of England.

---

## EUSTACE:
Will you, Bertie?

---

## BERTIE:
No.

---

Get out.

---

## EUSTACE:
I’m not leaving until you promise to help me, Bertie!

---

## BERTIE:
I’m already loaning you my home to deceive your uncle, you great dimwit.

---

I refuse to get involved in your pathetic imaginary love affair with Gertrude Winklesworth-Bode.

---

I’ve got my own problems there.

---

## EUSTACE:
But, Bertie, we were at school together! 

---

## BERTIE:
What’s that got to do with anything?

---

## EUSTACE:
Dear old Malvern Prep!

---

## BERTIE:
No.

---

Absolutely not.

---

## EUSTACE:
Jolly golden school days! 

---

## BERTIE:
Stop it!

---

## EUSTACE:
Boyhood chums of old.

---


## BERTIE:
No! This is a definitive No!

---

## EUSTACE:
♪ Through the years that lie ahead, ♪

---

♪ With every single step♪ 

---

♪ We’ll recall our golden days— ♪

---

## BERTIE & EUSTACE:
♪ At dear old Malvern Prep! ♪

---

## BERTIE:
Oh, all right! Shut up!

---

## EUSTACE:
You’re a brick, Bertie.

---

Now, do impress upon her that I’ve got a serious mind and so forth.

---

## BERTIE:
I didn’t know you had any sort of mind!

---

## EUSTACE:
Do be serious, Bertie.

---

You’ve got to… I don’t know, lay the groundwork!

---

## BERTIE:
Yes, all right.

---

I shall play on her like a harp.

---

## EUSTACE:
Can you play a harp?

---

## BERTIE:
As it happen, no.

---

But as I would play a harp if I could play a harp.

---

## EUSTACE:
Topping! Oh, Gertrude, my Gertrude!

---

## BERTIE:
What a morning! Have you ever noticed, Jeeves, that just when things are humming along, 

---

somewhere in the background, Fate is quietly slipping the lead in to the boxing glove?

---

## JEEVES:
Very profound, sir.

---

## BERTIE:
Look after him, Jeeves, he’s liable to go leaping merrily into the Thames and drown in earnest.

---

## JEEVES:
You may rely on me, sir.

---

I do, Jeeves.

---

I do.

---


[Tango playing]

---

## BERTIE:
Jeeves! Door! 

---

[Doorbell rings again]

---

Jeeves! —oh, right.

---

It’s high time you got back, you great dundering— Who the devil are you?

---

## SIR RUPERT:
I am Sir Rupert Watlington-Pipps.

---

Who the devil are you?

---

## BERTIE:
I— I— I—

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Speak up, you ninny! 

---

## BERTIE:
See here, you can’t—

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Can’t I? That’s what those rebels thought when they attacked the Regiment at Kirkekan in ’85.

---

But they were wrong, sir.

---

Wrong!

---

## BERTIE:
What?

---

## SIR RUPERT:
What do you mean by standing around with your mouth hanging open.

---

Fetch my bag!

---

## BERTIE:
Look here—

---

## SIR RUPERT:
This instant! On the double.

---

March!

---

## BERTIE:
You know—

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Where is my blasted nephew? A fine welcome, I must say!

---

## BERTIE:
Look, there’s been a slight—

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Don’t just stand there blathering, show me to my room.

---

Gad, I cannot abide an incompetent servant!

---

## BERTIE:
You think that I—

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Speak when you’re spoken to and not until then, man!

---

## BERTIE:
I am not a servant!

---

## SIR RUPERT:
On that we agree.

---

Such impertinence! I shall insist that my nephew give you the sack!

---

## BERTIE:
See here, you— 

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Name?

---

## BERTIE:
Sir Rupert—

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Not my name, you blundering jackass! Yours!

---

## BERTIE:
Bertram Wilbeforce Wooster!

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Dreadful! Without a doubt, you are the most pathetic excuse for a valet that I have ever seen! Now then, Woolrich—

---

## BERTIE:
Wooster.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Unpack my bag, but mind that you don’t pinch anything.

---

I shall know if you do.

---

## BERTIE:
Will you let me speak!

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Certainly not! Pick up that bag this instant!

---

## BERTIE:
But I—

---

## SIR RUPERT:
PICK UP THAT BAG!

---

## SIR RUPERT:
I do not tolerate insolence.

---

No, sir! Why if you were under my command, I’d have you flogged! Now be about your business, Woolscroft!

---

## BERTIE:
Wooster.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Silence!

---

## JEEVES:
Dear me.

---


## BERTIE:
Jeeves!

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Who the— You’re not my nephew! 

---

## JEEVES:
No, sir.

---

## BERTIE:
Sir Rupert! 

---

## JEEVES:
Yes, sir, leave it to me.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Good Lord, this place has more traffic than Waterloo Station.

---

## JEEVES:
My apologies, Sir Rupert, for not being here to welcome you properly.

---

I am Jeeves, Mr. Bassington-Bassington’ valet.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
What?

---

## BERTIE:
What?

---

## SIR RUPERT:
If you are Eustace’s valet, who is that?

---

## JEEVES:
Allow me to present Mr. Bertram Wooster, Mr. Bassington-Bassington’s houseguest.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
What?

---

## BERTIE:
What?

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Eustace never mentioned a houseguest.

---

## JEEVES:
No, sir? That is surprising.

---

Mr. Wooster is, I believe, an old schoolmate.

---

## BERTIE:
Yes.

---

Yes! Dear old Malvern Prep.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Extraordinary.

---

Why the devil didn’t you say something?

---

## BERTIE:
I did!

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Not one word! Think you’re funny, do you?

---

## BERTIE:
Well, I—

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Damned impudent puppy!

---

## JEEVES:
Most distressing, sir.

---

If I might suggest, perhaps you might like to see your room and have a short rest after your journey.

---

I would, of course, notify you upon Mr. Bassington- Bassington’s return.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Very kind, I’m sure.

---

But where is Eustace?

---

## BERTIE:
Yes, where—

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Why didn’t he meet my train?

---

## JEEVES:
I am sorry to say, sir, that Mr. Bassington-Bassington seemed to be under the very definite impression that you were to arrive tomorrow.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Poppycock!

---

## JEEVES:
Most unfortunate, sir.

---

I do apologize.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Not your fault.

---

You seem a decent fellow.

---


## JEEVES:
Very kind, sir.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Yes, very well.

---

Show me to my room.

---

## JEEVES:
This way, sir.

---

I wonder, would you care for a hot toddy?

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Excellent idea.

---

Good man!

---

## JEEVES:
Most gratified, sir.

---

## EUSTACE:
Here I am at last! I think I’ve got everything.

---

Hullo, Bertie, what’s wrong? You look all white and shaken, rather like a dry martini!

---

## BERTIE:
You ass! You dolt! 

---

## EUSTACE:
Bertie!

---

## BERTIE:
Blockhead!

---

## EUSTACE:
Have you gone quite mad?

---

## BERTIE:
He’s here.

---

Right here! Now! This very minute!

---

## EUSTACE:
Who is?

---

## BERTIE:
Sir Rupert Bleeding Watlington-Pipps, you great blithering oaf!

---

## EUSTACE:
What?!

---

## BERTIE:
He arrived just now! 

---

## EUSTACE:
No, no! Tomorrow! 

---

## BERTIE:
No, no! Today!

---

## EUSTACE:
If this is your idea of a joke, Bertie, let me tell you there is such a thing as going too far, and you have gone it!

---

## BERTIE:
Come back here!

---

## EUSTACE:
He can’t be here!

---

## BERTIE:
Well he is, and let me tell you, that man’s supply of the milk of human kindness is plainly short by several gallons!

---

## EUSTACE:
I cannot understand how this happened!

---

## BERTIE:
Could it be, oh, just off the top of my head, that you have the brain of a titmouse!

---

## EUSTACE:
I say, that’s a bit harsh!

---

## BERTIE:
Right! I mustn't disparage titmice in that fashion! (leaping) Aha! Got you!

---

## EUSTACE:
No you don’t! Look here, Bertie, Uncle Rupert wired that he was arriving on Wednesday, the 21st! This is Tuesday!

---

## BERTIE:
By Jove, you’re right.

---

Today is Tuesday.

---

## EUSTACE:
You see!

---

## BERTIE:
Tuesday, the 21st, you galloping pea brain!

---

## EUSTACE:
No!

---

## BERTIE:
Hah!

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Unhand my nephew, you villain!

---

## EUSTACE:
Uncle!

---

## BERTIE:
Sir Rupert!

---

## SIR RUPERT:
What is the meaning of this!

---

## BERTIE:

I— He— we were merely— say something, Eustace!

---

## EUSTACE:
Uncle!

---

## JEEVES:
May I be of assistance, sir?

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Jeeves, fetch a constable at once.

---

This fellow assaulted my nephew!

---

## EUSTACE:
I, I, I, I, I—

---

## JEEVES:
Perhaps I can clear up what may be a misapprehension, sir.

---

## BERTIE:
Yes! Jeeves will explain.

---

Won’t you, Jeeves?

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Are you telling me there’s an explanation for what I just witnessed?

---

## JEEVES:
A very simple one, sir.

---

## BERTIE:
Childishly simple! (to JEEVES) What is it?

---

## JEEVES:
I believe Mr. Wooster and Mr. Bassington-Bassington were rehearsing for a performance.

---

An amateur theatrical of some sort.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Eustace, am I to understand that you planning to disgrace your family by appearing on the stage?

---

## EUSTACE:
No, no! Of course, not.

---


## BERTIE:
Heaven forfend!

---

## EUSTACE:
Wouldn’t think of it!

---

## JEEVES:
I believe it is for a charity benefit of some sort, is it not, sir?

---

## EUSTACE:
Yes! 

---

## BERTIE: 
Charity!

---

## SIR RUPERT:
A benefit?

---

## EUSTACE: & BERTIE
For children! For the poor! Poor—
—children! Right!

---

So, you see, uh, Bertie and I— Rehearsing, as it were—

---

## EUSTACE:
Absolutely.

---

Frightfully good cause, you know— act of charity toward our fellow, albeit, less fortunate, um, you know—

---

## BERTIE:
We thought we’d do our bit to bring a bit of cheer to the poor little nippers!

---

## SIR RUPERT:
On a stage? Good God… acting!?

---

## JEEVES:
I believe Mrs. Spencer Gregson is chairing the benefit committee.

---

A most respectable lady.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Mrs. Who?

---

## BERTIE:
My Aunt Agatha.

---

Frightfully proper and all that.

---

## EUSTACE:
Simply overflowing with the, uh, milk of human whatnot.

---

## BERTIE:
What? Oh, yes.

---

Full of… compassion for the poor.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
I see.

---

(grudgingly) Well, I suppose that makes it all right.

---

Not that I approve, mind you.

---

## EUSTACE:
Oh, no!

---

## BERTIE:
That’s quite clear.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Yes, well… See here, Weaver.

---


## BERTIE:
Wooster.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
I’d like a word with my nephew, if you don’t mind.

---

## BERTIE:
Not at all! Make yourself entirely at home.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
You certainly seem to have done so…
A private word!

---

## BERTIE:
Oh! Certainly.

---

I’ll just pop off back to my—which room am I in again, Jeeves, old man?

---

## JEEVES:
Second door on the right, sir.

---


## BERTIE:
That’s it.

---

I thought so.

---

## JEEVES:
I’ll just fetch your bag, sir.

---


## BERTIE:
My what?

---

## JEEVES:
Your bag, sir.

---

It was located at Victoria Station and a porter has just now delivered it with abject apologies.

---

## BERTIE:
Well, I should think so! Very careless of them to misplace it.

---

Yes, just bring it along, Jeeves.

---

Pleased to meet you, Sir Rupert.

---

I’ll just toddle off to the guest room now.

---

Where I’m staying… I’m off.

---

Uh… right.

---


## EUSTACE:
Welcome to London, Uncle Rupert.

---


## SIR RUPERT:
Why didn’t you meet my train?

---

## EUSTACE:
Yes, ah, well, I was expecting you—

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Tomorrow.

---

That’s what your man said.

---

What sort of idiot could possibly mistake the date?

---

## EUSTACE:
Ah… I suppose… Bertie must have got the message wrong.

---

Silly old Bertie…

---

## SIR RUPERT:
I thought as much.

---

## EUSTACE:
Terribly decent fellow, of course.

---

But not much upstairs.

---

Still, I try to be tolerant.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Does you credit, I’m sure.

---

How long is he planning to stay?

---

## EUSTACE:
I’m not quite… Not long.

---

I think.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
This infernal rigmarole that you two were rehearsing… that his notion?

---

## EUSTACE:
Oh, um, well.

---

It’s his aunt, you know, who’s in charge.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Eustace, I’m going to be brutally frank with you.

---

## EUSTACE:
Oh, God.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
You’ve done well for yourself.

---

I’d never have believed it, but you have.

---

## EUSTACE:
Thank y—

---

## SIR RUPERT:
You’re in a position now where there are those who will try to take advantage of you.

---

## EUSTACE:
Really?

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Moochers.

---

Sponges.

---

Leeches who will attach themselves to you and bleed you dry.

---

## EUSTACE:
Oh, but surely—

---

## SIR RUPERT:
This Wainwright fellow— 

---

## EUSTACE:
Wooster.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Very suspicious.

---

Beady little eyes.

---

Vacant expression.

---

I don’t want you falling under evil influences now that, against every expectation, you’ve managed to come up in the world.

---

## EUSTACE:
I shouldn’t call Bertie an evil influ—

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Don’t be naive.

---

One only has to look at the fellow to know he’s a bounder of the very worst sort.

---

## EUSTACE:
Well…

---

## SIR RUPERT:
I shall be keeping a sharp eye on him.

---

Never fear.

---

## JEEVES:
I beg your pardon, Mr. Bassington-Bassington.

---

Might I enquire about your plans for tea?

---

## EUSTACE:
Plans?

---

## JEEVES:
For tea, sir.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Plans? Nothing complicated about tea.

---

Brew it.

---

Drink it.

---

No plan needed.

---

## BERTIE:
Did someone mention tea?

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Heard that, did you?

---

## BERTIE:
You know who serves up a perfectly smashing tea? The Ritz! 
---
Eustace, old bean, you ought to treat your Uncle to tea at the Ritz on his first afternoon in London.

---

## EUSTACE:
What?

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Balderdash.

---

Complete waste of money.

---

## BERTIE:
Oh, don’t give that a thought! Eustace is simply rolling in the oof.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Rolling in the what?

---

## BERTIE:
The oof! The dibbs! The happy cabbage, the oil of palm!

---

## SIR RUPERT:
What in God’s name are you babbling about?

---

## EUSTACE:
But Bertie—

---

## JEEVES:
If I may elucidate, Sir Rupert, I believe Mr. Wooster is attempting to suggest that
Mr. Bassington-Bassington 

---

is supplied with ample funds and, as your host, would naturally insist upon paying.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Yes, well, that’s very generous, but I’ve only just arrived.

---

I don’t see why we should rush straight off—

---

## BERTIE:
There are people coming — 

---

## SIR RUPERT:
People?

---

## EUSTACE:
What people?

---

## BERTIE:
The people! The people!

---

## JEEVES:
I beg your pardon, sir, but you did arrange for the woman to come and measure for new drapes today.

---

## EUSTACE:
I did?

---

## BERTIE:
Of course you did! It is your flat, after all.

---

I am merely a guest here.

---

## EUSTACE:
Ah, so you are.

---

Yes, Uncle Rupert, we’d better toddle off to the Ritz straight away.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
But I don’t want—

---

## BERTIE:
She’ll be here any moment! 

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Well, what of it? Stop pushing!

---

## EUSTACE:
Merely trying to assist you, Uncle— here we go!

---

## SIR RUPERT:
But I don’t have my—

---

## JEEVES:
Your hat and coat, sir.

---


## BERTIE:
Off you go!

---

## EUSTACE:
Bertie, you will remember to put in a good word for me with Gertrude, won’t you? Thanks ever so!

---

## BERTIE:
You know, Jeeves, I believe there are fellows in this world who could woo and win the heart of Gertrude Winklesworth-Bode — 

---

tough, hardy chaps with strong chins and glittering eyes — but Eustace Bassington-Bassington is not one of them!

---

## JEEVES:
And yet, sir, he does seem most determined to pursue the courtship.

---

## BERTIE:
The thing one has to understand about Bassy is that, although a perfectly decent chap, 

---

he has only just enough intelligence to open his mouth when he wants to eat.

---

Certainly no more.

---

Still, old school chum and all that.

---

## JEEVES:
It would seem, sir, that dear old Malvern Prep has a great deal to answer for.

---

## BERTIE:
Do you know, Jeeves, I believe you’re right.

---

But then, you always are.

---

## JEEVES:
The Honourable Gertrude Winklesworth-Bode.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Thank you, Jeeves.

---

Hullo, Bertie, who was that man?

---

## BERTIE:
—Man?

---

## GERTRUDE:
The highly irritated-looking gentleman who left with Mr. Bassington-Bassington just now.

---

## BERTIE:
Uh… plumber.

---

## GERTRUDE:
A plumber? Really? Awfully well dressed.

---

## BERTIE:
He ought to be for what he charges, ha, ha! Ha.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Is that meant to be humorous? I can never be certain with you.

---

## BERTIE:
Yes, I’m a man of mystery.

---

Evidently.

---

Where’s Aunt Agatha?
---

## GERTRUDE:
Delayed at the milliner’s.

---

She sent me on ahead.

---

I think she did it on purpose.

---

## BERTIE:
Why?

---

## GERTRUDE:
So that we could be together, silly.

---

Now, tell me, what have you done with yourself all day?

---

## BERTIE:
Done?

---

## GERTRUDE:
You must have done something, Bertie, dear.

---

Have you been out at all?

---

## BERTIE:
No… no.

---

I spent the afternoon musing on Life.

---

## GERTRUDE:
How do you mean?

---

## BERTIE:
If you come to think of it, what a strange thing Life is! So unlike anything else, don't you know, if you see what I mean.

---

## GERTRUDE:
I’m not entirely sure that I do.

---

## BERTIE:
Ah, splendid! Thank you, Jeeves.

---

## JEEVES:
Not at all, sir.

---

## BERTIE:
Gertie, will you pour?

---

## GERTRUDE:
Of course.

---

Now, Bertie, no more jokes.

---

I want to speak seriously to you.

---

That will be all, Jeeves.

---

## JEEVES:
Very good, miss.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Bertie, dear, you must think of the future.

---

You have such potential.

---

## BERTIE:
Oh, no.

---

I haven’t.

---

Really.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Yes, yes, you do.

---

Are you working?

---

## BERTIE:
Am I what?

---

## GERTRUDE:
Working.

---

You did tell me that you were thinking of getting a job.

---

## BERTIE:
Still thinking… Still thinking.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Bertie, Bertie, Bertie.

---

What am I to do with you?

---

## BERTIE:
Give up, I’m afraid.

---

I’m clearly a hopeless cause.

---

## GERTRUDE:
I don’t believe that for a moment.

---

## BERTIE:
See here, Gertie, there is something I want to speak to you about particularly.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Oh?

---

## BERTIE:
You see, well, this is dashed awkward.

---

The thing is… I have this friend…

---

## GERTRUDE:
Really? Do go on, Bertie, darling.

---

## BERTIE:
I feel like such a fool even bringing it up.

---


## GERTRUDE:
Mustn’t be shy.

---

## BERTIE:

The fact is, this friend of mine is… perfectly potty about you.

---

Over the moon.

---

Round the bend.

---

Unfit for civilized society and so forth.

---

And, you know, he’s a bit— well, he’s a bit of an ass, really.

---

Looks at you sideways and gets all tongue-tied.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Does he, Bertie?

---

## BERTIE:
Oh, good lord, yes.

---

So he, this friend, asked me to ask you if you mightn’t find it in your heart to take pity on the poor fish and, oh I don’t know, toss a smile or two his way.

---
There, it’s out.

---

Bit sticky, but, I mean what's a fellow to do?

---

## GERTRUDE:
Don’t say any more.

---

## BERTIE:
…I wasn't going to actually.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Oh, Bertie, you are so very funny!

---

## BERTIE:
…Am I?

---

## GERTRUDE:
Yes, of course you are, you great silly.

---

## BERTIE:
…All right, but what about this chappie I’ve been on about? Any thoughts about his plight?

---

## GERTRUDE:
Please do assure this “friend” of yours that his attentions are not unwelcome.

---

In fact, quite the contrary!

---

## BERTIE:
…Really? I must confess, Gertie, I’m a bit taken aback.

---

Do you— you don’t mean— have you guessed his identity?

---

## GERTRUDE:
Of course I have!

---

## BERTIE:
Well, I can see that I shall have to press down the mental accelerator to keep up with you! You are the cleverest girl.

---

## GERTRUDE:
And you are most adorably bashful young man!

---

## BERTIE:
…Am I?

---

## GERTRUDE:
I really had no notion.

---


## BERTIE:
No notion about what?

---

## GERTRUDE:
About the depth of your feelings.

---

## BERTIE:
My what?

---

## GERTRUDE:
Bertie, darling, I’m so very glad you’ve spoken at last.

---

## BERTIE:
I— I— You know, I don’t think I expressed myself too well just now.

---

## GERTRUDE:
The words may have been halting, but what do mere words matter?

---

## BERTIE:
No, they matter!

---

## GERTRUDE:
Nonsense.

---

My heart has heard your heart calling… and, Bertie, my heart has answered.

---

## BERTIE:
Has it? —Jeeves!

---

## GERTRUDE:
What is it Bertie? You’ve gone all pale.

---


## BERTIE:
No, have I?

---

## GERTRUDE:
To think we’ve known each other for years and I never realized that you were in love…

---

## BERTIE:
Jeeves! Dear Lord, Jeeves!

---

## JEEVES:
Sir?

---

## BERTIE:
The tea— it’s gone cold.

---

Do you think we might have some fresh?

---

## JEEVES:
Right away, sir.

---

## GERTRUDE:
I think I’ll just freshen up a bit before Aunt Agatha gets here.

---

I’m sure I must look a fright.

---

## BERTIE:
Yes! 

---

## GERTRUDE:
I do?

---

## BERTIE:
No! Of course not.

---

Still, I expect you’ll want to powder the old nose and all that, what? Jeeves?

---

## JEEVES: 
This way, Miss Winklesworth-Bode.

---


## GERTRUDE: 
I won’t be a moment.

---

## BERTIE:
No hurry! None.

---

## BERTIE:

Jeeves! My cunning plan to arouse Gertie’s interest in Bassy may have gone just the tiniest bit awry.

---

## JEEVES:
Dear me, whoever would have guessed? Excuse me, sir.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
I won’t be a moment, I tell you!

---

## BERTIE:
Sir Rupert! Bassy! What are you doing here?

---

## SIR RUPERT:
He lives here.

---

I am his guest.

---

A better question is, what are you doing here?

---

## EUSTACE:
Uncle Rupert forgot his walking stick — honestly, we won’t be a moment.

---

## BERTIE:
For god’s sake, hurry! 

---

## SIR RUPERT:
See here, you—

---

## EUSTACE:
We had better press on, Uncle.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Very well, but I shall want to have a very serious discussion with you over tea.

---

## EUSTACE:
I shall certainly look forward to that.

---

They’re not here, are they?

---

## BERTIE:
Gertie’s in the other room.

---

Aunt Agatha will be here any second!

---

## EUSTACE:
Gertrude is here! Bertie, did you put in a word for me? Tell her how I felt about her?

---

## BERTIE:
I did.

---

Just sort of hinted a bit, you know.

---


## EUSTACE:
How did it go over?

---

## BERTIE:
My eloquence was not without its effect.

---

However it is just possible that she may have misunderstood.

---

## EUSTACE: 
Misunderstood how? 

---

## BERTIE:
Well—

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
Good afternoon, Jeeves.

---

Bertram.

---

Oh.

---

Mr. Bassington-Bassington.

---

You’re still here.

---

Are you taking tea with us?

---

## EUSTACE:
Uh—

---

## BERTIE:
Actually, he was just on his way out.

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
How nice… You mustn't let us detain you.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Oh, Aunt Agatha, you’ve arrived! Hullo, again, Mr. Bassington-Bassington.

---

Has Bertie told you two our wonderful news?

---

## EUSTACE:
News?

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
Why, no.

---

What news?

---

## BERTIE:
It’s nothing, really.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Nothing! What a thing to say!
Aunt Agatha, Bertie has confessed his love and he and I are to be married!

---

## EUSTACE:

What!

---

## AUNT AGATHA: 
Splendid! This is marvelous! (furiously) 

---

## EUSTACE: 
It’s unbelievable! 

---

## BERTIE:
Something of a shock, eh, what?

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
Gertrude, dear, come embrace me.

---

I couldn’t be more delighted.

---

And so grateful dear, that you are willing to tackle a worm like Bertram.

---

## BERTIE:
I beg your pardon?

---

## GERTRUDE:
There really is a great deal of good in him.

---

## EUSTACE:
There is not.

---

## GERTRUDE:
It just needs someone to bring it out.

---

I know that I can make something of him! The poor boy just needs someone to take him firmly in hand!

---

## BERTIE:
I don’t! Really!

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
Bless you, dear Gertrude.

---

You are so very brave! Goodness, there is so much to do!

---

## BERTIE:
Do?

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
We had better stay over in town for an extra day and start right in on the arrangements.

---

## BERTIE:
Arrangements? 

---

## GERTRUDE:
That sounds simply divine!

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
And then, of course, we should discuss the question of where you’ll want to reside after
you’re married.

---

## BERTIE:
Now wait—

---

## GERTRUDE:
Indeed yes.

---

I have a number of very definite ideas about that!

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
Be advised by me, my dear, the very first thing you want to do is get rid of Jeeves.

---

## BERTIE:
What?!!

---

## GERTRUDE:
I couldn’t agree more.

---

Frankly, I’ve never really cared for the man.

---

## BERTIE:
I absolutely forbid such a thing!

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
Don’t be ridiculous, Bertram.

---
Still, my dear, we ought to make use of the fellow while he’s still in service.

---

Oh, I know just the thing! Perhaps a small dinner party tomorrow evening.

---

Something intimate…just the family.

---

Come, Gertrude, let us consult with Jeeves about the menu.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Isn’t this exciting, Bertie darling?

---

## EUSTACE:
You blighter! (backing away) 

---

## BERTIE:
Now, Bassy— 

---

## EUSTACE:
You fiend in human shape!

---

## BERTIE:
There’s been a misunderstand—

---

## EUSTACE:
To think that I believed you were my friend! But the scales have fallen from my eyes at last!

---

## BERTIE:
Look, you ass, I did tell her about you! But she evidently thought I was talking about— ow!—me!

---

## EUSTACE:
Rotter! To think that I have been betrayed by a Malvern Prep boy!

---

## SIR RUPERT: 
Stop it this instant! HALT! 

---

## EUSTACE: 
Uncle!

---

## BERTIE:
Sir Rupert!

---

## SIR RUPERT:
You! How dare you lay hands on my nephew!

---

## BERTIE:
There’s a perfectly simple explana—

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Don’t hand me that tommyrot about rehearsing.

---

My Aunt Fanny! Do you take me for a fool? You there, Weaver, Watson, Wilson— whatever you call yourself, I want you out!

---

## BERTIE:
Out?

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Out! This instant, sir! Out of my nephew’s flat and out of his life! And no arguments from you, Eustace.

---

## EUSTACE:
No, indeed, Uncle.

---

You were absolutely right about him.

---

He is a scoundrel and a very bad influence!

---

## BERTIE:
Well, I like that— after all I’ve done for you!

---

## EUSTACE:
You’ve done for me all right.

---

I think you had better leave.

---

## BERTIE:
Leave! Where am I supposed to go?

---

## SIR RUPERT:
You should have thought of that before attacking my nephew! Jeeves!

---

## BERTIE:
Jeeves!

---

## EUSTACE:
Jeeves!

---

## JEEVES: 
Dear me.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Throw this reprobate out!

---

## BERTIE:
Eustace, I shall be forced to speak—

---

## SIR RUPERT:
No you don’t! We’ve heard quite enough from you, you black-hearted scoundrel.

---

Out you go!

---

## JEEVES:
Allow me to show you the door, Mr. Wooster.

---

## BERTIE:
Jeeves!

---

## JEEVES:
It’s for the best, sir.

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
What in the name of heaven is going on in here?

---

## GERTRUDE:
Bertie, are you leaving? 

---

## SIR RUPERT: 
Agatha! 

---

## AUNT AGATHA: 
Rupert!

---

## EUSTACE:
Have you two met? 

---

## SIR RUPERT & AUNT AGATHA:
No!

---

## GERTRUDE:
Bertram Wilbeforce Wooster, I demand to know what is going on!

---

## BERTIE:
Lovely to see you all.

---

Sadly, I must pop off.

---

Jeeves will explain.

---

Ta!

---

## GERTRUDE:
Jeeves?

---

## EUSTACE:
Jeeves!

---

## AUNT AGATHA AND RUPERT:
Jeeves!

---

INTERMISSION

---

## JEEVES:
Yes?

---

## BERTIE:
I’ve come to ’ang the wallpaper.

---

## JEEVES:
Indeed? Then you had better come in, I suppose.

---

## BERTIE:
This the room, is it?

---

## JEEVES:
It is certainly a room.

---

Odd, but I was unaware that arrangements had been made to redecorate.

---

## BERTIE:
Oh, yes.

---

Today’s the day, all right.

---

Got me work order right here.

---

## JEEVES:
Then, by all means, you had better start immediately.

---

Will you require assistance moving the furniture?

---

## BERTIE:
Jeeves, it’s me!

---

## JEEVES:
Good heavens.

---

How astonishing.

---

And what a…remarkable suit of clothing.

---

## BERTIE:
I’m in disguise.

---


## JEEVES:
So I observe, sir.

---

## BERTIE:
Where is everyone?

---

## JEEVES:
Mr. Bassington-Bassington breakfasted in bed—

---

## BERTIE:
What cheek! The blighter cold-heartedly heaves me out onto the street — then lolls about like a sultan in my bed eating my breakfast!

---

## JEEVES:
And as for Sir Rupert—

---

## BERTIE:
Dead?

---

## JEEVES:
No, sir.

---

He should be departing momentarily for a luncheon engagement

---

## BERTIE:
What happened yesterday? After I left, I mean.

---

Tell me everything!

---

## JEEVES:
Ah.

---

That was a moment fraught with drama.

---

Fortunately, I was able to smooth things over satisfactorily.

---

## BERTIE:
Jeeves, you move in mysterious ways, your wonders to perform!

---

## JEEVES:
Thank you, sir.

---

I explained to those present that you had received an urgent summons from a stricken friend.

---

Sadly, I was unable to supply any further details as the dire nature of the emergency required your immediate departure.

---

## BERTIE:
Good, good…

---

## JEEVES:
Mrs. Spencer Gregson and the future Mrs. Wooster—

---

## BERTIE:
Jeeves, please! Don’t torment me.

---

## JEEVES:
As you wish, sir.

---

The ladies decided not to await your return.

---

Indeed, Mrs. Spencer Gregson seemed more than usually perturbed.

---

I fancy that Sir Rupert may have been the cause.

---

## BERTIE:
Yes, the moment he clapped eyes on her— well, of course that’s enough of a shock to unnerve any man.

---

Still, I could see that Sir Rupert was, if not exactly disgruntled, far from being gruntled!

---

## JEEVES:
As you say, sir.

---

## BERTIE:
Mark my words, Jeeves, I suspect some dark mystery involving Aunt Agatha and Sir Rupert.

---

## JEEVES:
Their behavior does seem to suggest that the two have, shall we say… a Past.

---

## BERTIE:
Difficult to imagine.

---

One envisions the two of them like mastadons bellowing to one another across primeval swamps.

---

## JEEVES:
Ahem, yes.

---

There is very little more, sir.

---

There was a bit of momentary confusion as
Miss Winklesworth-Bode seemed under the impression that Sir Rupert was the, er, plumber.

---

## BERTIE:
Ah.

---

I may have put in that bit.

---

## JEEVES:
I surmised as much, sir.

---

Nonetheless, I was able to calm the troubled waters.

---

The ladies took their leave.

---

The gentlemen remained.

---

Sir Rupert was most uncharacteristically silent, seemingly lost in thought.

---

Mr. Bassington-Bassington spent the evening composing an epic poem, a tragedy I believe, concerning lost love.

---

## BERTIE:
Oh, spare me.

---

## JEEVES:
Sir Rupert did not learn that this is, in fact, your home rather than his nephew’s.

---

Nor did Mrs. Spencer-Gregson discover that Sir Rupert believes his nephew to be the master here.

---

## BERTIE:
(admiringly) Absolutely pitch perfect.

---

Were you always like this, Jeeves, or did it come on suddenly?

---

## JEEVES:
Sir?

---

## BERTIE:
The brain.

---

The old noodle.

---

The gray matter.

---

Tell me, were you an outstandingly brilliant child?

---

## JEEVES:
My mother thought me intelligent, sir.

---

## BERTIE:
Well, you can't go by that— my mother thought me intelligent!

---

## JEEVES:
I take your point, sir.

---

## BERTIE:
Well, Jeeves, we are in a tremendous pickle.

---

## JEEVES:
Most distressing, sir.

---

## BERTIE:
Jeeves, it strikes me that love is responsible for most of the trouble in the world today.

---

## JEEVES:
An interesting theory, sir.

---

Would you care to expatiate upon it?

---

## BERTIE:
As a matter of fact, no, Jeeves.

---

No.

---

The thought just occured to me, you know, as thoughts do.

---

## JEEVES:
Quite so, sir.

---

## BERTIE:
The question now is, where do we go from—

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Jeeves!

---

## JEEVES:
Sir?

---

## SIR RUPERT:
I’m off to my luncheon engagement.

---

Who the devil—?

---

## JEEVES:
The workman, sir.

---

Mr. Bassington-Bassington has decided to have this room re-papered.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Shocking waste of money! Is my nephew still at home?

---

## JEEVES:
Yes, sir.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Strange sort of profession that allows him to lounge about half the day.

---

What, exactly, is his business?

---

## JEEVES:
I couldn’t say precisely, sir.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Damned mysterious.

---

At least we’re well rid of that dreadful so called “friend” — that awful Woodruff fellow.

---

See here, man.

---

Do be careful!

---

## BERTIE:
Beg pardon, gov’ner!

---

## JEEVES:
Will you be returning for tea, Sir Rupert?

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Doubtful.

---

I shall probably be out most of the afternoon.

---

Tell me, Jeeves, that rather striking-looking woman who was here yesterday…

---

## JEEVES:
Mrs. Spencer-Gregson?

---

## SIR RUPERT:
That’s the one.

---

By Jove, what a magnificent filly! 

---

[BERTIE makes a strangled sound]

---

Eh? Did you speak?

---

## JEEVES:
I do beg your pardon, sir.

---

Clearing my throat.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Ah.

---

Well.

---

I don’t suppose you are acquainted with her husband?

---

## JEEVES:
I believe Mrs. Spencer-Gregson to be a widow of some years’ standing, sir.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Really? Well, well, well…

---

## EUSTACE:
Good morning, Uncle.

---

Off to your luncheon?

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Yes, I must be going.

---

Eustace, I am forced to admit, you’ve done extremely well for yourself in London.

---

## EUSTACE:
Well, I do my best.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
It would be pointless to interrupt your career, whatever it is, with a sojourn in India.

---

You’d much better keep on doing… whatever it is you do.

---

## EUSTACE:
Thank you, Uncle Rupert!

---

## SIR RUPERT:
You certainly don’t require an allowance from me any longer — complete waste of money.

---

Well, I’m off!

---

## BERTIE:
That’s my dressing gown!

---

## EUSTACE:
Good Lord!

---

## BERTIE:
And those are my pajamas! 

---

## EUSTACE:
Bertie?

---

## BERTIE:
Aha! Ow, ow, ow!

---

## EUSTACE:
What are you doing here?

---

## BERTIE:
I live here, you ungrateful—

---

## EUSTACE:
Oh, am I supposed to be grateful that you’ve stolen the woman I love?

---

## BERTIE:
I didn’t! Which, if you had any functioning brain cells, you would certainly know! 

---

The very last thing on earth that I wish to do is wed Gertrude Winklesworth-Bode!

---

## EUSTACE:
Then why are you?

---

## BERTIE:
I’m not! At least I hope to heaven that I’m not.

---

It’s just that—

---

## EUSTACE:
What?

---

## JEEVES:
Gentlemen—

---

## BERTIE:
Gertie imagines that I’m madly in love with her and… she—

---

## EUSTACE:
She— what?!

---

## BERTIE:
—has convinced herself that I have potential!

---

## EUSTACE:
You haven’t!

---

## BERTIE:
Of course I haven’t! But try telling her that!

---

## JEEVES:
Gentlemen—

---

## BERTIE:
The wretched girl is positively determined to marry me and, I mean, you know, one does want to be civil.

---

## EUSTACE:
Civil! I wonder you can bear to live with the stain of betrayal on your conscious!

---

## BERTIE:
Well, I had ample time to ponder “betrayal” whilst spending the night huddled in a doorway after being booted from my own home by my best friend! 

---

To whom, I might add, I had already lent my flat, my valet, and all the money I had on my person! 

---

And if that doesn't leave me without a stain on my conscience, then I don't know what it doesn't leave me without a stain on!

---

## JEEVES:
If I might be permitted a word, gentlemen.

---

## EUSTACE:
Of course, Jeeves.

---


## BERTIE:
By all means.

---

## JEEVES:
Mr. Wooster, you did not, strictly speaking, spend the night huddled in a doorway, but very comfortably indeed at the Drones Club.

---

## BERTIE:
How the deuce—?

---

## JEEVES:
The wine steward there, a particular friend of mine, had a word with the fishmonger’s boy who subsequently made a delivery here this morning.

---

## EUSTACE:
Aha!

---

## JEEVES:
While you Mr. Bassington-Bassington, spent the night in Mr. Wooster’s bed, in his pajamas.

---

Further, you seem to have overlooked the fact that, even while being ejected from his own home, Mr. Wooster did not betray you to your uncle.

---

## BERTIE:
Aha!

---

## JEEVES:
In short, gentlemen, may I suggest that we desist from a debate regarding who is at fault? Our time would be much better spent plotting strategy.

---

## BERTIE:

Sorry…

---

## EUSTACE:
So am I, old bean.

---

Appreciate all you’ve tried to do.

---

Even if it has ended in utter and complete disaster.

---

## JEEVES:
One must not abandon hope, Mr. Bassington-Bassington.

---

You are not, after all, being shipped to India.

---

## EUSTACE:
No, but my uncle has cut me off financially and I’ve lost the woman I adore.

---

To him!

---

## BERTIE:
(bleakly) And I am doomed to marry Gertrude Winklesworth-Bode.

---

It has all the dark inevitability of a Greek tragedy.

---

## EUSTACE:
Unless…

---

## BERTIE:
Jeeves! Surely you must see a light in all this blasted darkness!

---

## JEEVES:
Gentelmen, we are faced with two separate difficulties.

---

First: to extricate Mr. Wooster from his engagement to Miss Winklesworth-Bode.

---

Secondly: to persuade Sir Rupert to restore Mr. Bassington-Bassington’s allowance while, at the same time, 

---

preventing him from learning that this is, in fact, Mr. Wooster’s flat.

---

## BERTIE:
There’s a third difficulty, Jeeves.

---

I’m expected to host a dinner party here tonight celebrating my engagement.

---

That may come as a bit of a surprise to Sir Rupert, since he booted me from the place last night.

---

## JEEVES:
By great good fortune, Sir Rupert is dining out this evening.

---

## EUSTACE:
That’s right! It’s one reason for his visit! Some sort of reunion dinner for retired officers.

---

## JEEVES:
(to Bertie) You, sir, shall send a message inviting Miss Winklesworth-Bode to come early for cocktails.

---

## BERTIE:
Whatever for?

---

## JEEVES:
To allow Mr. Bassington-Bassington an opportunity to improve upon his unfortunate first impression.

---

## EUSTACE:
Yes! This time, I shall assert my personality.

---

Oooh! I could read her my poem!

---

## JEEVES & BERTIE
No!

---

## JEEVES:
Now, it is by no means certain that Sir Rupert will have left by the time Miss Winklesworth- Bode arrives.

---

## EUSTACE:
Oh! I can tell Uncle that Miss Winklesworth-Bode has come to see me.

---

## BERTIE:
What! My fiance?

---

## JEEVES:
Ah, but Sir Rupert was not present at the moment of Miss Winklesworth-Bode’s fateful announcement.

---

## EUSTACE:
As far as he knows, she might very well be a particular friend of mine.

---

He’ll be utterly delighted.

---

## BERTIE:
Where am I while Sir Rupert is being utterly delighted?

---

## JEEVES:
You, sir, will remain hidden until Sir Rupert has safely departed.

---

## EUSTACE:
Yes, Bertie, he does seem to have taken the most unaccountable dislike of you.

---

## BERTIE:
Evidently, I’m a bad influence.

---

I suppose I’ve turned out to be one of those fellows my father always warned me against.

---

## JEEVES:
Once Sir Rupert is out of the way, it will be your task, gentlemen, to persuade Miss Winklesworth-Bode to end her engagement to Mr. Wooster.

---

## BERTIE:
Yes! 

---

## EUSTACE:
Absolutely!

---

## BERTIE:
How exactly are we doing that again?

---

## JEEVES:
By presenting Miss Winklesworth-Bode with an irresistible alternate.

---

## BERTIE:
What, Bassy— irresistible? How in the name of all that’s holy are we going to pull that off?

---

## JEEVES:
Miss Winklesworth-Bode is a young lady who reveres intellect.

---

## BERTIE:
Jeeves, have you met Bassy?

---

## EUSTACE:
I say!

---

## JEEVES:
Some small deception may be required.

---

If Mr. Bassington-Bassington could express an interest in, say, German philosophy…

---

## BERTIE:
Jeeves, that is a perfectly splendid and by no means unripe idea!

---

## JEEVES:
Very kind, sir.

---


## BERTIE:
Sheer genius! 

---

## EUSTACE:
What is?

---

## BERTIE:
Bassy, all you have to do is bone up on— Jeeves, who’s that chappie with the peculiar name that Gertie is always raving about?

---

## JEEVES:
Nietzsche, sir.

---

Although— 

---

## BERTIE:
The very bloke!

---

## EUSTACE:
Who?

---

## BERTIE:
Some sort of German philanthropist.

---

## JEEVES:
Philosopher, sir.

---

## BERTIE:
Yes, yes.

---

Bassy, look.

---

All you have to do is pass yourself off as a student of German whatever and Gertie will go absolutely dippy over you!

---

## EUSTACE:
She will? That would be ecstasy! O, Gertrude— in passing, don’t you think Gertrude is a musical name?

---

## BERTIE:
No.

---

## EUSTACE:
No?

---

## BERTIE:
No.

---

## EUSTACE:
You don’t think it sounds rather like the wind rustling through the treetops?

---

## BERTIE:
No.

---

## EUSTACE:
Bertie, you are a fatheaded worm without any soul.

---

## BERTIE:
Do shut up, Bassy.

---

Now, there’s a book around here somewhere—

---

Ah, thank you, Jeeves.

---

## EUSTACE:
Types of Ethical Theory — Oh, Bertie, I don’t know…

---

## BERTIE:
You needn’t commit the thing to memory for heaven’s sake.

---

## JEEVES:
If you could just glance over one or two high points.

---

## BERTIE:
Then, tonight when you’re chatting up Gertie just, you know, casually toss out the odd phrase or two at appropriate moments.

---

## EUSTACE:
Do you really think I can pull this off?

---

## BERTIE:
It is a guaranteed certainty! Tell him, Jeeves!

---

## JEEVES:
We shall simplly have to rely on Mr. Bassington-Bassington’s cool head and thespian skills.

---

## EUSTACE:
Oh, dear lord…

---

## BERTIE:
I have every confidence in you, Bassy!

---

## JEEVES:
Will you be staying for luncheon, sir?

---

## BERTIE:
I certainly shall! I’ve got a responsibility to coach old Bassy here.

---

## JEEVES:
As you wish, sir.

---

Will that be all?

---

## BERTIE:
Yes, thank you Jeeves.

---

## EUSTACE:
I feel awfully anxious about this evening, Bertie.

---

Suppose Gertrude catches me out?

---

## BERTIE:
Not a chance.

---

## EUSTACE:
Of course there’s still the matter of Uncle Rupert cutting off my allowance.

---

## BERTIE:
What? Oh, that.

---

I’d forgotten about that.

---

Yes… I rather fancy that it was Shakespeare — 

---

or some equally brainy lad — who said that just when a chappie is feeling particularly top hole, 

---

Fate sneaks up behind him with a lead pipe.

---

## EUSTACE:
…I don’t think that’s Shakes—

---

## BERTIE:
Never mind that now.

---

One problem at a time, Bassy.

---

We’ve got to transform you into a scholar by cocktail hour.

---

To work!

---

## EUSTACE:
Uh, well… Ah! Here’s a chapter entitled “Idiopsychological Ethics.”

---

## BERTIE:
Excellent! Sounds like a real page turner!

---

## EUSTACE:
Oh, Bertie.

---

What we men must suffer for love.

---

Now at last I understand why they say, "Women, O Women!"

---

## BERTIE:
Who says that?

---

## EUSTACE:
…Well, chaps mostly.

---

## BERTIE:
Right.

---

No more shilly-shallying.

---

Here, you’d better start with this bit.

---

It’s a perfect corker!

---

## EUSTACE:
“The postulate or common understanding involved in speech is certainly co-extensive, 

---

in the obligation it carries, with the social organism of which language is the instrument…”

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Ah, Jeeves.

---


## JEEVES:
Sir?

---

## SIR RUPERT:
I’ve been wondering.

---

There was such a lot of confusion last night when I had you chuck that Webster fellow out…

---

## JEEVES:
I believe it is “Wooster,” sir.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Yes, yes.

---

It is of no consequence.

---

I merely wanted to say that, of course, I had no idea that ladies were present.

---

In fact, I must confess I never did quite understand why, er, exactly they were here.

---

I mean, clearly, they are acquainted with my nephew in some fashion.

---

## JEEVES:
That is true, sir.

---

Although… 

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Yes?

---

## JEEVES:
It should, perhaps, be mentioned that both ladies had actually called to see Mr. Wooster.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
That scalawag? Whatever for?

---

## JEEVES:
It is my understanding that Mrs. Spencer-Gregson is related to Mr. Wooster.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
…No!

---

## JEEVES:
His aunt, I believe.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Good heavens! And I— Right in front of her! What can she be thinking?

---

## JEEVES:
I could not say, sir.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
I must make amends.

---

But how? Gad, what a blunder.

---

## JEEVES:
If it is of any comfort, sir, Mrs. Spencer-Gregson could hardly be said to dote upon Mr. Wooster.

---

Indeed, she had been known to be highly critical.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Of course she is.

---

Clearly, the fellow’s a wastrel.

---

And she was never one to tolerate fools.

---

## JEEVES:
Indeed no, sir.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Both Agatha and I seem to be cursed with family trees that are destined to sprout nincompoops.

---

## JEEVES:
Very pithy turn of phrase, sir.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Thank you.

---

Do you know, it has been 40-odd years since I last clapped eyes on that remarkable woman?

---

## JEEVES:
Indeed, sir?

---

## SIR RUPERT:
And yet, by Jingo, one glimpse and suddenly I found myself every bit as tongue-tied as I was the night we were parted.

---

## JEEVES:
As the late Mr. Tennyson observed, “'Tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all,”sir.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Very true.

---

No regrets, you know.

---

Never look back.

---

Did my duty.

---

But I never forgot her…

---

## JEEVES:
On another topic, sir, I wonder if I might enquire…

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Yes.

---

What is it?

---

## JEEVES:
I could not help but notice that you wear the regimental insignia of the Duke of Cornwall’s Light Infantry.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Jeeves! Are you a military man?

---

## JEEVES:
I fear not, sir, but a cousin of mine did spend many years as a batman in the 5th Battalion.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Why that’s my old battalion! What was the fellow’s name?

---

## JEEVES:
Brooke, sir.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Can’t say that it rings a bell… still, small world, eh, Jeeves?

---

## JEEVES:
Very true.

---

Before you leave, sir, a message arrived for you.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Thank you, Jeeves… Great Scott, there’s been a last minute change of venue.

---

## JEEVES:
Indeed, sir?

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Most irregular.

---

Can you imagine if I had arrived at the wrong address? Good thing I got this in time.

---

## JEEVES:
Providential, sir.

---

## EUSTACE:
Everything ready, Jeeves? 

---

## JEEVES:
Quite ready, sir.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Ready? Ready for what?

---

## EUSTACE:
Uncle! I thought you’d left.

---


## JEEVES:
Excuse me, sir.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Ready for what, I say!

---

## EUSTACE:
…for a quiet evening at home.

---

Reading an improving book…

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Bit formal, aren’t you?

---

## EUSTACE:
Well, a fellow in my position does have to keep up certain standards.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
I suppose.

---

## EUSTACE:
I expect you’re off to your reunion?

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Yes, shortly.

---

This the new wallpaper, is it?

---

## EUSTACE:
The what?

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Didn’t you hire that workman to repaper in here today?

---

## EUSTACE:
…Yes?

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Flinging your money about very freely, aren’t you?

---

## EUSTACE:
Well, a fellow in my position –

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Standards, yes.

---

So you said.

---

Still, I must admit, quite a distinct improvement.

---

So, you’re staying in?

---

## EUSTACE:
Oh, yes.

---

I’m not much for nightlife.

---

I’ll probably turn in early.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Good lad.

---

## EUSTACE:
Yes, well, one of the King Georges — I forget which — once said that a certain number of hours sleep each night — 

---

I can’t recall at the moment how many— made a man… something.

---

And I for one agree with him!

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Good! Glad to see that you aren’t wasting your time on frivolity and pleasure, like so many young men today.

---

## EUSTACE:
No indeed, Uncle.

---

I live like a monk.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Are you expecting someone? 

---

## EUSTACE:
No no…

---

## GERTRUDE:
Good evening, Jeeves.

---

## JEEVES:
Good evening, Miss.

---

May I take your wrap?

---

## GERTRUDE:
Thank you, Jeeves.

---

Oh.

---

Hullo again, Mr. Bassington-Bassington.

---

I didn’t realize you would be here.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Certainly he is here.

---

Where else would he be? Eustace, you sly dog, aren’t you going to introduce me to this delightful young lady?

---

## GERTRUDE:
Well, we did meet last night, after a fashion, but in all the confusion—

---

## EUSTACE:
Ha, ha, ha! That was quite a dust up, wasn’t it? Miss Winklesworth-Bode, do allow me to present my uncle, Sir Rupert Watlington-Pipps.

---

Uncle Rupert, this… enchanting creature is the Honourable Gertrude Winklesworth-Bode.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Well, aren’t you the flatterer? And amazingly fluent this evening.

---

But, where is—

---

## EUSTACE:
Uncle Rupert is just on his way to attend a reunion of retired officers.

---

Military man, you know.

---

You mustn’t let us keep you, Uncle.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Yes, yes, I’m going.

---

No need for a third wheel, eh, Eustace? 

---

Delighted to properly make your acquaintance, my dear.

---

## GERTRUDE:
I’m very pleased to meet you, Sir Rupert.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Charming girl.

---

Well, I shall leave you two young people alone, although I suppose I really ought to insist on a chaperone.

---

## GERTRUDE:
I think there must be some sort of misunder—

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Now, now, no need to say a word.

---

I was young once myself.

---

Good evening!

---

## GERTRUDE:
I don’t understand.

---

Where is Bertie?

---

## EUSTACE:
Oh, he’ll be here momentarily.

---

He asked me to keep you company until he arrives.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Really, Bertie specifically asked me to come early and then he’s not even here!

---

## EUSTACE:
Shameful.

---

I don’t blame you a bit for being put out.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Oh, it’s typical of Bertie… You’re very different this evening, Mr. Bassington-Bassington.

---

Quite articulate.

---

## EUSTACE:
Oh, yes, well, I was just a trifle off my game when we first met.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Just a bit, perhaps.

---


## EUSTACE:
May I offer you a cocktail?

---

## GERTRUDE:
I’d adore a dry martini.

---

## EUSTACE:
Jeeves?

---

## JEEVES:
Yes, sir.

---

## EUSTACE:
Ah, here we are.

---

To you!

---

## GERTRUDE:
I really shouldn’t, but as long as Aunt Agatha isn’t here— she’s a fierce teetotaler, you know.

---

## EUSTACE:
How like her.

---

I beg your pardon, but is Mrs. Spencer Gregson your aunt as well as Bertie’s?

---

## GERTRUDE:
Not really, although I’ve always called her Aunt.

---

She’s my godmother, actually.

---

She and my late mother were bosom cronies from their schooldays.

---

They always planned for Bertie and I to make a match.

---

## EUSTACE:
Really? You astonish me! 

---

## GERTRUDE:
Do I? Why?

---

## EUSTACE:
Why? Er, right.

---

Well… the irony of it all, you know.

---

Life.

---

And so forth.

---

## GERTRUDE:
How do you mean?

---

## EUSTACE:
As the, uh, philosopher wrote, you know, uh… and, I’m paraphrasing here, “all living things aim to discharge their strength" 

---

and express their “will to power” and, well, that is to say, you seem like the last person on earth to bend to another’s, uh, will.

---

If you follow me…

---

## GERTRUDE:
I’m not entirely sure that I do.

---

When you say “will to power” can you— is it possible that you are quoting… Friedrich Nietzsche?

---

## EUSTACE:
…Yes?

---

## GERTRUDE:
Beyond Good and Evil, Prelude to—

---

## GERTRUDE & EUSTACE:
—a Philosophy of the Future!

---

## GERTRUDE:
I simply cannot believe my ears!

---

## EUSTACE:
Really, this is the most remarkable coincidence! I had no idea you were interested in German philosophy, Miss Winklesworth-Bode!

---

## GERTRUDE:
Do call me Gertrude.

---

## EUSTACE:
And you must call me Eustace.

---

Or, if you prefer, Bassy.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Eustace it is, then.

---

Tell me, are you familiar with Thus Spoke Zarathustra?

---

## EUSTACE:
…Intimately!

---

## GERTRUDE:
Oh, this is smashing! I would never have pegged you for an intellectual.

---

## EUSTACE:
Can’t judge a book by its cover, eh?

---

## GERTRUDE:
No more than one can associate the doctrine of eternal recurrence with the spiritual standpoint of the superman!

---

## EUSTACE:
…Just what I was going to say! Oh, Gertrude, dearest—

---

## GERTRUDE:
Now, Eustace, we mustn't forget ourselves.

---

I wonder what can be keeping Bertie?

---

## EUSTACE:
Bertie! I shall never fathom what a girl as brilliant as you are could see in an insensitive dolt like Bertie!

---

## GERTRUDE:
Admittedly, Bertie is a bit of a mental midget, but he does have one great redeeming quality.

---

## EUSTACE:
What?

---

## GERTRUDE:
He is malleable.

---

## EUSTACE:
He’s— (confused) what is he?

---

## GERTRUDE:

Malleable.

---

Compliant.

---

Docile.

---

Capable of being formed, shaped by a guiding hand.

---

## EUSTACE:
Oh, I see.

---

Well, that’s that then.

---

Ow!

---

## GERTRUDE:
Is something wrong?

---

## EUSTACE:
No.

---

Yes! I cannot bear it! Gertrude, darling, can’t you, won’t you, shape me instead?

---

## GERTRUDE:
Really, Eustace, I’ve only just met you!

---

## EUSTACE:
Gertrude, I adore you.

---

I worship you! In fact, I’ve written a poem—

---

## GERTRUDE:
Mr. Bassington-Bassington, control yourself! I am promised to another! This is completely immoral!

---

## EUSTACE:
Ah, but Nietzsche denies that there is a universal morality applicable indiscriminately to all human beings!

---

## GERTRUDE:
True.

---

Some moralities are more appropriate for dominating and leading social roles; some are more suitable for subordinate roles.

---

## EUSTACE:
So what counts as a preferable and legitimate action actually depends upon the kind of person one is!

---

## GERTRUDE:
And what kind of person are you, Eustace?

---

## EUSTACE:
A desperate one, Gertie, darling!

---

## GERTRUDE:
Eustace, darling! Gertrude, Gertrude!
Say something in German!

---

## EUSTACE:
Glockenspiel!

---

## BERTIE:
What ho, what ho, what ho!

---

## BERTIE:
Hullo, Gertie.

---

Hullo, Bassy.

---

## EUSTACE:
Didn’t hear you come in.

---

## BERTIE:
Didn’t you? Well, who’s for a drink? 
Ah, thank you, Jeeves.

---


…So, what have you two been up to?

---

## GERTRUDE:
We were just… discussing Nietzsche.

---


## BERTIE:
Good Lord, what a crashing bore! 

---

## GERTRUDE:
We did not find it so.

---

## EUSTACE:
No indeed! I personally have never felt more stimulated!

---

## BERTIE:
Ah, that will be Aunt Agatha!

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Sorry to intrude but I—

---

## EUSTACE:
Uncle Rupert!

---

## SIR RUPERT:
You! What are you doing here, Williams?

---

## BERTIE:
You— I— Wooster.

---

## GERTRUDE:
What is he doing here? What a very odd question!

---

## EUSTACE:
Uncle! Your dinner! You’ll miss it!

---

## SIR RUPERT:
I have missed it! I ended up at the wrong place entirely.

---

Arrived at a hall full of disreputable looking men all wearing beards.

---

Dreadful creatures, shouting and waving placards.

---

I’ve no notion what it was about.

---

I simply cannot understand where I went astray…

---

## JEEVES:
Most unfortunate, Sir Rupert.

---

Brandy?

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Thank you, Jeeves.

---

## JEEVES:
Perhaps your driver mistook the address.

---


## SIR RUPERT:
Yes, possibly.

---

## BERTIE:
One more for dinner, Jeeves.

---

## JEEVES:
Very good, sir.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
It was the most disagreeable experience—

---

[Doorbell]

---

And then, to discover you here, Wilson!

---

## BERTIE:
Wooster.

---

## GERTRUDE:
But of course he’s here.

---

Why shouldn’t he be?

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
No need to announce me, Jeeves.

---

I do hope I haven’t kept everyone waiting— Rupert!

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Agatha!

---

## BERTIE:
Aunt Agatha! What a frightful– ly jolly surprise!

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
Surprise? Whatever do you mean?

---

## BERTIE:
Mean? Nothing, nothing… Five for dinner, Jeeves.

---

If that’s all right with you, Eustace?

---

## EUSTACE:
Oh! Yes, of course, rather! 

---

## JEEVES:
Very good, sir.

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
Why shouldn’t it be all right with him? What’s he got to do say about—

---

## BERTIE:
Do sit down everyone!

---

## EUSTACE:
Yes, do! Let us be comfortable.

---

## BERTIE:
Well, well, well, well.

---

Well.

---

Here we are.

---

Friends and family gathered ‘round the hearth.

---

Nothing like it.

---

## EUSTACE:
I must say, you do have a very comfortable place here.

---

## BERTIE & EUSTACE:
Thank you.

---

## GERTRUDE:
…Are you quite well, Bertie? You look all flushed.

---

## BERTIE:
Me? Never better! Pink of health and all that!

---

## SIR RUPERT:
You haven’t changed a bit.

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
Nonsense.

---

I’m a dreadful old woman.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
You? Never! 

---

## BERTIE:
She really is.

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
Bertram.

---


## EUSTACE:
So, you two have met? 

---

## AUNT AGATHA & SIR RUPERT:
No!

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
Well— Yes.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Briefly.

---

Mere, uh—

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
Acquaintences.

---


## SIR RUPERT:
So to speak—

---

## GERTRUDE:
Oh, come now.

---

Confess, you two darlings.

---

What was it? A youthful passion? Was there a great scandal?

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Scandal! Certainly not.

---

The idea!

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
It was decades ago.

---

We were both quite young.

---

## BERTIE:
Really? How odd.

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
Try not to be an ass, Bertram.

---


## BERTIE:
I do try!

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
Try harder.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
I shall never forget that last time we met.

---

I’d just got my commission.

---

The regiment was due to ship out.

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
My parents did not approve.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
They thought you could do much better than a penniless young officer.

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
Oh, Rupert.

---

## GERTRUDE:
And so, the young lovers were cruelly parted! Oh, how tragic! And yet, terribly romantic!

---

## SIR RUPERT:
To think that, all these years later, we should be brought together again.

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
Yes.

---

Rupert, I had no notion that you were acquainted with my nephew, Bertram.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
We met quite recently.

---

Through my nephew, Eustace.

---

## EUSTACE:
Boyhood chums, you know.

---

## BERTIE:
Dear old Malvern Prep!

---

## BERTIE and EUSTACE:
Through the years that lie ahead, With every single—

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
Gentlemen.

---


## EUSTACE:
Yes?

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
Don’t.

---

## BERTIE:
Actually we both went on from Malvern Prep to Oxford together.

---

## GERTRUDE:
I expect you were very studious.

---

## EUSTACE:
Only compared to some.

---

Did Bertie ever tell you about the time he dropped a pudding on the Bishop of Woolrich?

---

## GERTRUDE:
No.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
On a bishop?

---

## BERTIE:
It wasn’t really meant for the bishop.

---

It was meant for Boco Fiddleworth.

---

Unfortunately, from above, they look remarkably similar.

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
Is this meant to be amusing? 

---

## BERTIE:
Had to be there, I suppose.

---

## EUSTACE:
At any rate he, the bishop, looked up to see why it was suddenly raining pudding—

---

## BERTIE:
Tripped on the stairs and went head over heels—

---

## EUSTACE:
Smack into the courtyard fountain!

---

## BERTIE:
Happy times.

---

## EUSTACE:
That’s not what you said when you were arrested!

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Arrested!

---

## EUSTACE:
Not his fault, really.

---

After all, he was very young.

---

## BERTIE:
Quite right.

---

## EUSTACE:
Not to mention fried to the tonsils!

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
Intoxicated!

---

## BERTIE:
Oh, well, not— 

---

## EUSTACE:
Pickled to the gills! 

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
Bertram!

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Eustace!

---

## BERTIE:
Ah.

---

Well, we musn’t go boring on about our school days.

---

## EUSTACE:
No, indeed! Not a bit interesting.

---


## AUNT AGATHA:
Rupert, I am covered in shame.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
No one could possibly blame you, my dear.

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
I can only hope that his marriage will be the making of him.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Married! You?

---

## BERTIE:
You know, that was precisely my reaction.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
How would you support a wife?

---

## BERTIE:
Generally, I find a steady pressure on the left elbow does the trick!

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
On a more sober note, we are gathered here tonight to celebrate an announcement.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
What announcement? 

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
An engagement.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Really? I had no inkling.

---

Well perhaps a tiny inkling.

---

This is splendid news!

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
It is indeed.

---

## JEEVES:
Dinner is served.

---

## EUSTACE:
Oh, thank God.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
May I escort you in, Agatha?

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
By all means, Rupert.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Eustace, you go on ahead.

---

I need to have a word with Bertie.

---

## EUSTACE:
Oh? Oh! Yes, I’ll just toddle on in then…

---

## GERTRUDE:
Bertie, dear, I don’t quite know how to break this to you.

---

## BERTIE:
Just come straight out with it, that’s the way.

---

## GERTRUDE:
I’m afraid that I have had…

---

## BERTIE:
Yes? 
Yes?

---

## GERTRUDE:
A change of heart.

---

Don’t hate me, Bertie!

---

## BERTIE:
No, no, of course not.

---

I could never hate you, Gertie.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Oh, I do feel so dreadful!

---

## BERTIE:
It’s Bassy, I suppose.

---

## GERTRUDE:
I’m afraid so.

---

It happened quite suddenly.

---

I’m so sorry.

---

You must find a reason to go on living, Bertie!

---

## BERTIE:
Yes, well, I’ll try.

---

Mind you, it won’t be easy.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Please don’t say anything until I have a chance to tell Aunt Agatha.

---

She will be simply devastated!

---

## BERTIE:
Not a word.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Oh, dear.

---

Am I being selfish? Hurting you so and disappointing poor Aunt Agatha.

---

Perhaps, after all—

---

## BERTIE:
Now, now, screw your courage to the, uh, whatsis…

---

## GERTRUDE:
Sticking place.

---


## BERTIE:
Really?

---

## GERTRUDE:
Shakespeare.

---

## BERTIE:
That fellow said the rummiest things! 

---

## GERTRUDE:
Oh, Bertie—

---

## BERTIE:
Oh, Gertie— there now, you see how that sounds? It would never have worked.

---

Besides, old thing, when all is said and done, you have got to follow your heart.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Oh…you’re so noble and unselfish, Bertie.

---

…I’m all weepy!

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
Bertram! Have you taken complete leave of your senses?

---

## BERTIE:
Sorry.

---

Sorry.

---

I was just…ah.

---

Well, never mind.

---

I’ll join you, shall I?

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
Of course! You might have warned me that you were going to invite your friend and his uncle to dine.

---

## BERTIE:
Yes, well it all happened rather last minute

---

## JEEVES:
Shall I serve the soup course, sir?

---

## BERTIE:
Soup! The very thing! By all means, start the soup course, Jeeves.

---

Marvelous notion!

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Agatha? Oh.

---

Beg pardon.

---

Are you quite all right, Walters?

---

## BERTIE:
Wooster, old bean! Wooster! 

---

And, as a matter of fact, I’m better than all right! I’m on top of the world!

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Agatha, that nephew of yours— bit eccentric, what?

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
By all rights, he should be locked up in a padded cell with the board of Lunacy Commissioners sitting on his head.

---

I do beg your pardon, Rupert.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Not at all, dear lady.

---

Believe me, every family has one.

---

Shall we?

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
You may serve, Jeeves.

---

## JEEVES:
Yes, madam.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
One moment, Jeeves.

---


## JEEVES:
Sir?

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Did you know about an engagement between my nephew and this Winklesworth-Bode girl?

---

## JEEVES:
I was certainly aware that Mr. Bassington-Bassington is quite besotted, sir.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Well, well, well.

---

I think we’d better have some champagne later, Jeeves.

---

## JEEVES:
Very good, sir.

---

## EUSTACE:
Everything all right?

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Eustace, my boy, everything is splendid.

---

You make an old man very proud.

---

In fact, given the happy occasion and, considering your future, I am restoring your allowance.

---

## EUSTACE:
Thank you, sir!

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Not at all.

---

In fact, I may well see my way to increasing it.

---

Very happy for you, Eustace!

---

## EUSTACE:
Did you hear, Jeeves! It’s working.

---

It’s all working!

---

## JEEVES:
My felcitations, sir.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Eustace, what is going on? Everyone keeps popping up and down from the table like jack- in-the-boxes!

---

## EUSTACE:
I’m terribly sorry, Gertrude.

---

You had better serve the soup now, Jeeves.

---

## JEEVES:
Very good, sir.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Eustace, dear, I’ve told Bertram the truth.

---

## EUSTACE:
Which truth? Oh, you— about us, you mean?

---

## GERTRUDE:
Yes.

---

## EUSTACE:
How did he take it?

---

## GERTRUDE:
I’m afraid his heart is broken.

---


## EUSTACE:
Ah.

---

## GERTRUDE:
I feel so dreadfully guilty!

---

## EUSTACE:
No.

---

You mustn't! Don’t we deserve happiness, darling?

---

## GERTRUDE:
But at what cost?

---

## EUSTACE:
Now, now.

---

Bertie will muddle through somehow.

---

He always does.

---

## GERTRUDE:
You’re right.

---

I must be resolute.

---

## EUSTACE:
Of course you must.

---

Nietzsche would expect no less.

---

## BERTIE:
Hate to intrude, but Jeeves keeps hovering with the soup tureen and Aunt Agatha is beginning to lash her tail.

---

## EUSTACE:
Quite right, old man.

---

Terribly sorry to have held everyone up.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Dear brave Bertie.

---

## EUSTACE:
Yes, er, chin up, old man.

---

## BERTIE:
If I had to lose her, at least it was to a Malvern Prep Boy.

---

## GERTRUDE:
We shall bend every effort to finding a lovely girl for you, won’t we, Eustace?

---

## BERTIE:
No, don’t do that.

---

## JEEVES:
Pardon me, sir, but I believe the other guests are more than ready for the soup course.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Oh, dear.

---

We’d better go in.

---

Thank you, Jeeves.

---

Come, Eustace.

---

## EUSTACE:
Yes, dearest.

---

Just coming.

---

## GERTRUDE:
You may serve the soup now, Jeeves.

---

## BERTIE:
Bassy, she’s broken the engagement!

---

## EUSTACE:
I know! And Uncle Rupert is restoring my allowance!

---

## BERTIE:
And we owe it all to Jeeves, who is, without a doubt, a bit of a marvel.

---

## JEEVES:
Thank you, sir.

---

## EUSTACE:
We’d better get back in.

---

Tally ho!

---

## JEEVES:
One moment, sir.

---

Your tie.

---


## BERTIE:
My what?

---

## JEEVES:
If I might suggest, sir, a shade more tightly knotted.

---

One aims at the perfect butterfly effect.

---

If you will permit me?

---

## BERTIE:
Jeeves, I am once more a happy bachelor! What do ties matter at a time like this?

---

## JEEVES:
There is no time, sir, when ties do not matter.

---

## EUSTACE:
Bertie, your Aunt—!

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
Is anyone actually planning to dine this evening?!

---

## BERTIE:
Just coming! Here I go!

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
One moment, young man.

---

I want a word with you.

---

## EUSTACE:
With me?

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
What precisely is going on between you and my goddaughter?

---

## EUSTACE:
Nothing… nothing!

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
I don’t understand what you are doing here at all, if it comes to that.

---

This was meant to be a private family celebration.

---

## EUSTACE:
I… I…

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
There is some undercurrent at work here.

---

I feel it.

---

What do you know about it, young man? Speak up!

---

## BERTIE:
Hullo, hullo, hullo.

---

What’s going on, you two? Not telling secrets, are we?

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
Bertram, there is some… conspiracy at work here.

---

And you are in the thick of it.

---

## BERTIE:
I can’t imagine what you mean, Aunt Agatha.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Is there something amiss, Agatha?

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
I believe there is, Rupert.

---

And I shall not rest until I get the bottom of it!

---

## SIR RUPERT:
I don’t understand.

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
Nor do I, but I intend to! Now.

---

Bertram! Sit!

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Eustace.

---

Sit!

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
I am waiting…

---

## GERTRUDE:
I beg your pardon, but… I’m all alone in there.

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
Come in, Gertrude.

---

There is some mystery here and I, for one, will not tolerate it.

---

Sit down.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Really, I—

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
Silence, dear.

---

Bertram is about to speak.

---

## BERTIE:
…I wasn’t, actually.

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
Yes.

---

You were.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Oh, I can’t bear it! You mustn't blame Bertie.

---

Or Eustace.

---

It’s all my fault!

---

## EUSTACE:
Darling, of course it isn’t!

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
Darling?

---

## SIR RUPERT:
What the devil is going on here?

---

## JEEVES:
Excuse me, sir, I was wondering about the soup course.

---

## EUSTACE:
Not now, Jeeves!

---

## BERTIE:
Yes, now! For god’s sake, serve the soup, Jeeves!

---

## SIR RUPERT:
What do you mean, giving orders in my nephew’s home?

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
Your nephew’s home? This is my nephew’s home!

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Don’t be ridiculous.

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
Ridiculous! Why you pompous old goat!

---

## SIR RUPERT:
By Jove, I can see that I’ve had a narrow escape!

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
How dare you!

---

## GERTRUDE:
Bertie, Eustace, is there something you wish to tell us?

---

## BERTIE: & EUSTACE
No! 

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
Nephew!

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Eustace!

---

## EUSTACE:
Bertie?

---

## BERTIE:
Run!

[UPBEAT 20's CHASE MUSIC PLAYS]

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
Come back here, you spineless worm!

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Halt, I say! NOW!

---

## GERTRUDE:
Eustace!

---

## EUSTACE:
Darling, I adore you! Sorry!

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
What did he say?!

---

## BERTIE:
Bassy! Don’t say anything to anyone about anything!

---

## EUSTACE:
Yes! No! Sorry!

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
Bertram! I demand an explanation!

---

## GERTRUDE:
Eustace! I must speak with you!

---

## EUSTACE:
Can’t stop, darling.

---

Sorry!

---

[CHASE MUSIC ENDS]

---

## GERTRUDE:
Eustace, darling! Are you injured?

---

## EUSTACE:
I’m not entirely certain.

---


## SIR RUPERT:
Get up this instant!

---

## GERTRUDE:
Careful, dearest.

---

Can you stand?

---

## EUSTACE:
I think so!

---

## GERTRUDE:
Good.

---

Deceiver! You are not the man I believed you to be!

---

## EUSTACE:
Gertrude!

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Halt! I want the unvarnished truth.

---

Out with it! Is this your home or not?

---

## EUSTACE:
…Not, sir.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Is this fellow your valet?

---

## EUSTACE:
No, Uncle.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
What do you mean by playing this shabby trick?

---

## EUSTACE:
You were going to send me to India to the bottom of the jute business! And I wanted to stay here because I’m in love with Gertrude.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
You deliberately led me to suppose you were a substantial businessman!

---

## EUSTACE:
Well, I have been thinking about going into business.

---

I could start a chicken farm!

---

## SIR RUPERT:
A what?!

---

## EUSTACE:
A chicken farm.

---

You buy a hen and it lays an egg every day of the week and you sell some of the eggs 

---

and the rest hatch out into more chickens that lay more eggs and the money simply rolls in!

---

## SIR RUPERT:
—What?!

---

## EUSTACE:
And I could live in the country.

---

Gertrude is quite fond of the country.

---

Of course, she’s not too fond of me, just at present.

---

But then, you went and cut off my allowance—

---

## SIR RUPERT:
What are you babbling about? You know nothing whatever about chickens!

---

## EUSTACE:
I know even less about jute, but that never worried you!

---

## SIR RUPERT:
You lied to me about your financial status!

---

## EUSTACE:
Of course I did.

---

I don’t want to go to India! I am in love with Gertrude.

---

If you could only see your way to advancing me a bit of—

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Not one penny! I disown you, sir.

---

You are dead to me!

---

## EUSTACE:
You know, Nietzsche said that it is downhearted, all-too-commonly-human attitudes like yours that stand as a mere bridge to be crossed and overcome!

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Who said what?!

---

## GERTRUDE:
Nietzsche was right! Oh, my brave Eustace!

---

## EUSTACE:
Do forgive me, dearest.

---

I’ve been the most awful ass!

---

## GERTRUDE:
Yes, you have, but darling, you have such potential!

---

## SIR RUPERT:
He does not! And who is this infernal Nietzsche fellow?!

---

## JEEVES:
If I might make a suggestion, sir.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
You!

---

## JEEVES:
I beg your pardon, Sir Rupert, but if Mr. Bassington-Bassington is in need of a little ready money, 

---

he might secure a tidy sum by granting an interview to several of the more spirited newspapers.

---

## EUSTACE:
An interview?

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Good Lord — the press?

---

## JEEVES:
Yes indeed.

---

I fancy that some of the livelier publications would only too eager to print the story of Sir Rupert Watlington-Pipps 

---

and his support of the Bolshevik cause.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Are you quite mad?

---

## GERTRUDE:
Why Sir Rupert, is that the mysterious meeting you attended earlier this evening?

---

## EUSTACE:
Bearded men with placards.

---

Why, Uncle! For shame!

---

## GERTRUDE:
I am deeply shocked.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
It was an accident.

---

I had the wrong direction, I tell you!

---

## JEEVES:
A not unknown occurrence for an officer who was widely known in the service, according to my cousin, as “Wrong Way Rupert.”

---

## EUSTACE:
No, not really?

---

## SIR RUPERT:
This is your doing! You sent me to that place!

---

## GERTRUDE:
I do believe that Jeeves is right.

---

The Chronicle would leap at a story like that! Think of the scandal!

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Scandal! Eustace! You wouldn’t do this to your own uncle!

---

## EUSTACE:
But, Uncle, you disowned me.

---

I am dead to you.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
I was hasty.

---

I didn’t mean it!

---

## GERTRUDE:
The Daily Mirror eats up stories of this kind.

---

They’d be sure to pay handsomely, Eustace!

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Eustace, my boy, are you going to let this young woman dictate to you?

---

## EUSTACE:
Oh, yes, Uncle.

---

She’s going to mold me!

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Wait! Dear boy, you’re so impetuous.

---

I was once young and in love myself, you know.

---

## GERTRUDE:
And?

---

## SIR RUPERT:
I shall… of course, restore your allowance.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Aren’t you a darling? But that won’t be necessary.

---

## EUSTACE:
It won’t?

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Why not?

Because I’ve pots of money of my own.

---

## GERTRUDE:
You do? 

---

## SIR RUPERT:
You do?

---

## GERTRUDE:
I do.

---

Now.

---

There will be no more talk of India and jute.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
No, indeed!

---

## GERTRUDE:
You, Sir Rupert, will mind where you’re going and keep away from those Bolsheviks!

---

## SIR RUPERT:
But I didn’t—

---

## GERTRUDE:
Eustace cannot afford to be connected in any way with radicals.

---

He is thinking of going into politics.

---

## EUSTACE:
Politics?

---

## GERTRUDE:
Yes, dear.

---

Much better than chickens.

---


## JEEVES:
If I might offer a suggestion.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Yes, Jeeves?

---

## JEEVES:
A celebratory dinner at, perhaps, the Ritz might be in order.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Do you think? But, Jeeves, you went to all the trouble to arrange dinner here—

---

## BERTIE:
Help me! For pity’s sake!

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
I am not finished with you, young man! The rest of you, stay right where you are.

---

Come, Bertram!

---

## GERTRUDE:
Dinner at the Ritz it is!

---

## EUSTACE:
Smashing idea!

---

## JEEVES:
I beg your pardon, but there is the small matter of informing Mrs. Spencer-Gregson of the engagement.

---

[a crash is heard from the kitchen]

---

## GERTRUDE:
Oh, dear, oh, dear.

---

She will be disappointed.

---

She had her heart set on me marrying Bertie.

---

## EUSTACE:
Will she make trouble for us?

---

## GERTRUDE:
Possibly.

---

Dear Aunt Agatha is, in her way, rather a force of nature.

---

## JEEVES:
Perhaps Sir Rupert, with his experience facing enemy fire, could handle matters tactfully.

---

## EUSTACE:
Would you, Uncle?

---

## GERTRUDE:
Do you really think you could, Sir Rupert?

---

## SIR RUPERT:
…Pots of money? 

---

## GERTRUDE:
Simply oodles.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Welcome to the family, my dear! You must call me Uncle Rupert as we are to be related.

---

Now, you just leave this matter in my hands.

---

Belive me, I know how to handle Agatha!

---

## GERTRUDE:
Aren’t you the sweetest thing?

---

[a crash is heard from the dining room]

---
Come, Eustace.

---

## EUSTACE:
Yes, dear.

---

(aside) Thank you ever so, Jeeves.

---

## JEEVES:
Allow me to offer my congratulations, Mr. Bassington-Bassington.

---

## GERTRUDE:
Eustace!

---

## EUSTACE:
Coming!

---

## SIR RUPERT:
That girl is going to be another Agatha one day.

---

## JEEVES:
The thought did occur to me, sir.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Well, time to face the enemy.

---

 Agatha!

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
WHAT?!

---

## SIR RUPERT:
I require a word with you! 

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
Very well.

---

Bertram! Stay!

---

## BERTIE:
Jeeves, where have you been? She had me! Look, you can still see the imprints of her talons around my throat! 

---

My God, trapped in the other room with a slavering Aunt Agatha, gnashing her pointed teeth and glaring with her red eyes!

---

## JEEVES:
I do beg your pardon, sir.

---

I was attending to one or two matters out here.

---

## BERTIE:
Where are Bassy and Gertie? 

---

## JEEVES:
Gone, sir.

---

## BERTIE:
And their engagement?

---

## JEEVES:
Very much on, sir.

---

Sir Rupert was persuaded to give his blessing.

---

## BERTIE:
Jeeves you astound me! This has been one of your very best efforts.

---

…Are we going somewhere?

---

## JEEVES:
Yes, sir.

---

At once.

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
What did you say?!

---

## BERTIE:
But Jeeves, where can we go?

---

## JEEVES:
In all the excitement, sir, I somehow neglected to cancel our tickets to Cannes.

---

## BERTIE:
Jeeves, the Riviera?

---

## JEEVES:
Yes, sir.

---

You’ll find our bags in the hall.

---

## BERTIE:
Splendid! Oh, Jeeves, you recall that scarlet cummerbund of mine that you dislike so?

---

## JEEVES:
Sir?

---

## BERTIE:
Dispose of it, will you?

---

## JEEVES:
I have already taken the liberty of doing so, sir.

---

## SIR RUPERT:
Put that down! Don’t!

---

## AUNT AGATHA:
