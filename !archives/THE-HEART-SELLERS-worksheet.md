### JANE:

---

---

### LUNA:
Salamat po!


---

### JANE:
Kamsahamnida! And now, Lloyd Suh's...


---

### JANE & LUNA:
The Heart Sellers!

---

[Rock Music]

---

[Sound of train honking and going past]

---

### LUNA: 
… but for real no kidding, I think maybe you’re probably the first person 

---

we’ve ever had come to our apartment since we moved in,

---

that is if you don’t count people like our landlady or plumber, 

---

yes we had to have the plumber come up once but don’t worry it’s fixed, 

---

anyway don’t count that, so for real no kidding you’re the first one since we moved in, 

---

which I guess it’s only been since the semester started but that’s still a long time to go without visitors, huh? 

---

Back home boy it wasn’t even weird to come home and 

---

somehow there’s some people there you’ve never seen before, no kidding!,

---

funny how different everything is, 

---

here you are just one person and it feels somehow super monumental! 

---

that you’re coming into my apartment!

---

You coming in, yeah?

---

### JANE:
Mm.

---

### LUNA:
Yeah okay, so come on in!

---

Sorry sorry it’s so messy!

---

### JANE:
No no not messy.

---

### LUNA: 
Ha! You’re right, I guess we’d have to have things to mess up to make a mess, and we don’t have anything! 

---

So you’re right it’s not so messy but dusty I guess? 

---

American dust is funny, it bothers me more than dust back home. 

---

Does that make sense? Have you noticed anything different about the dust?

---

### JANE:
Hm?

---

### LUNA:
The dust here. Is different than the dust in Korea?

---

### JANE:
Is it?

---

### LUNA:
Yeah?

### JANE:
It is?

---

### LUNA:
Oh, I don’t know, I’m asking you is it!?

---

### JANE:
What?

---

### LUNA:
Never mind! Ha! It’s not important! 

---

Just small talk. Very small talk, ha? Small and insignificant. 

---

I’m nervous. This is wacky doodle. I don’t have a lot of friends. 

---

It was impulsive. You must think I’m impulsive, ha? Too much so. 

---

I don’t just ask strangers in the supermarket to come up to my apartment.

---

I don’t! Ever! You must think I’m goofy or something. 

---

My husband, he’s definitely gonna think I’m goofy. 

---

Oh well. He’s not here! You are! 

---

So I’m not the only one impulsive person. You said yes! 

---

You came up. To a stranger’s apartment. So you’re goofy too! 

---

Or neither one of us is goofy? Maybe it’s normal, this kind of thing? 

---

Am I talking too much? I’m talking too much. Tell me if I talk too much, ha? 

---

Anyway I saw you and I was like aaah!, there’s another one! Ha! 

---

In da empty supermarket on Thanksgiving! Looking at turkeys! Alone. 

---

And noticing turkeys are big. Too big to eat alone. 

---

I’m definitely talking too much. I’m glad you’re here. 

---

Not to put too much pressure on this or anything. No pressure. 

---

Very casual, yes? No big deal, huh? Super cool.

---

---

### LUNA:
Can I take your coat?

---

### JANE:
Coat?

### LUNA:
Yes, I can take it for you?

---

### JANE:
Take it?

### LUNA:
Yes, I can — hang it up for you?

---

### JANE:
Oh! Yes, yes. Um, okay.

---

### LUNA:
So funny you and me we have the same same coat!

---

### JANE:
Ha ha, yes, same.

### LUNA:
Itsa good coat, right?

---

### JANE:
Mm. Warm.

---

### LUNA:
K Mart?

### JANE:
What?

---

### LUNA:
I got mine at K Mart here, did you get yours same?

---

### JANE:
Yes, K Mart.

### LUNA: 
I love K Mart! 

---

So much things! Sometimes I go even when I don’t have nothing I need to buy, 

---

I like to just look at all the things there on display like I’m at a museum, you know? 

---

Just to study all the like whatsit, the artifacts of this strange place, 

---

their jewelry and their children’s toys and their decorations and things.

---

### JANE:
Yes, K Mart.

---

### LUNA:
I’m talking too much! Relax! Stay awhile!

---

Please have a seat! Lemme just

---

I’m so glad you’re here for this, I don’t even like American holidays, they’re strange; 

---

like how they do Halloween, why do they do that? 

---

With these children dressed like monsters banging on your door; why?, 

---

but this one seems important somehow? I like the sound of it, Thanksgiving! 

---

Thanks! Giving! This seems worth it to celebrate, right?, 

---

but my husband has to work because they assume oh he’s not from here he doesn’t care about holidays!, 

---

and since he’s just a first year resident, he’s gotta do whatever they say, 

---

I don’t have to tell you this, you know all about it, ha?, 

---

so here I am alone in the apartment all by myself, some holiday!

---

### JANE:
Mm.

---

---

### LUNA:
So! Anyway what kinda things do you like to do, huh? Around town?

---

### JANE:
Um.

### LUNA:

### JANE:

### LUNA:

---

so I haven’t been lotsa places yet, 

---

also I dunno how to drive maybe I’ll learn driving yeah?, 

---

can you imagine it me driving? I think I saw a bowling alley 

---

but I’ve never been bowling do you think it’s fun? Have you been bowling before?

---

### JANE:
No.

---

### LUNA:
Yeah me either. Are you hungry? You must be hungry! 

---

This is so embarrassing but we don’t have any good snacks to offer, 

---

I was supposed to buy things at the grocery, I had a list, 

---

my husband he’s gonna be surprised that instead of the list I got this turkey!

---

Do you like Ritz crackers? We have this, Easy Cheese, do you know this? 

---

Kinda strange. My husband it’s his favorite. We have Cheetos, you like Cheetos?

---

### JANE:
Oh, um. No thank you?

---

### LUNA:
I’m so sorry I’m so unprepared! I’m just gonna leave this out, 

---

try the Ritz they’re pretty good, 

---

I know it’s not much, we have a few other things here 

---

but probably we’ll need them for the turkey, right? 

---

---

### LUNA:

### JANE:

---

### LUNA:
But I lived with a big family, so many titas and lolas — 

---

aunties and grand-aunties, I mean — so we still had good food all the time, oh it’s been so long!

---

### JANE:
Mm.

---

### LUNA:
I miss them.

---

### JANE:
Mm.
 

---

### LUNA:
Especially since it’s a holiday. Even though it’s not our holiday, you know, it seems silly, 

---

I could call and say Happy Thanksgiving but they’d say what is that?, 

---

why you waste money long distance silly girl, this is ordinary Thursday, ha?, 

---

so it’s funny to miss them when I know they don’t miss me the same.

---

### JANE:
Yes, they miss. Same. Of course they miss same.

### LUNA:

### LUNA:

---

### JANE:

---

### LUNA:
Also in the Philippines too. Hard times everywhere.

---

### JANE:
You know Korea?

### LUNA:
Oh no 

---

I’ve never been there, no, but I follow along. 

---

I know they did something similar, military coup, right?

---

### JANE:
Military coup, yes.

---

### LUNA:
So scary. News is always so scary I guess, but still I like to read about it. 

---

I just like to know. I go to the library here, the university library 

---

and believe it or not they have newspapers from everywhere, 

---

I betcha they have em from Korea too, I read the ones from Manila sometimes. 

---

And my family whenever I call, even though I can’t call a lot it’s expensive, 

---

I don’t have to tell you that, they tell me things too.

---

### JANE:
Mm.

### LUNA:
About Marcos you know.

---

### JANE:
Marcos, mm.

---

### LUNA:
But we don’t have to talk about that!

---

### JANE:
In Korea, yes is bad time. But when I am little was bad time too, so. 

---

Cannot say which one is worser time. And you know, here? America. America is…

---

### LUNA:
Bad time too.

---

### JANE:
Yes.

---

### LUNA:

---

### LUNA:

---

### JANE:
Hee hee ya, little bit okay.

---

### LUNA:

---

### JANE:

---

---

### LUNA:

### JANE:

---

### LUNA:

### JANE:

---

### JANE:
Wow.

---

### LUNA:

---

### JANE:
No no, my husband, no.

### LUNA:

---

### JANE:
No he is yes drinker. Yes. But.

---

### LUNA:
Oh.

### JANE:

---

### LUNA
Ugh I know what you mean. My husband he drinks too, 

---

but yes it’s one of those things, huh? That a good wife’s not supposed to do.

---

### JANE:
Mm.

---

### LUNA:
You said he has late night?

---

### JANE:
Mm yes, he say gonna come home around 3 o’clock morning.

---

### LUNA:
Ah.

---

### JANE:
Your husband?

### LUNA:
All night, he has to stay until 6.

---

### JANE:
Wow.

---

### LUNA:
Maybe they’ll see each other?

### JANE:
Maybe!

---

### LUNA:
Maybe they’ll become best friends!

---

### JANE:
Ha! Yes.
But probably no.

---

### LUNA:
Oh.

---

### JANE:
Just because, my husband, you know, he is… he is kind of shy.

---

### LUNA:
So is mine!

### JANE:
Really?

---

### LUNA:
I mean at least over here he is, back in Philippines he wasn’t but you know, over here it’s different.

---

### JANE:
Mm.

---

### LUNA:
So I can’t imagine he’d ever start a conversation with someone, you know? 

---

A casual conversation. On his own.

---

### JANE:
Yes, true, my husband same way.

---

### LUNA:
I mean I can’t blame him, after all it’s hard to make friends.

---

### JANE:
Yes.

---

### LUNA:
Say do you have any pets?

### JANE:
Pets?

---

### LUNA:
Back in the Philippines I had a dog called Paco, 

---

he was like my best friend in the whole world. 

---

I’ve been thinking about getting a dog, have you thought about it?

---

### JANE:
Oh no, me no I don’t like.

---

### LUNA:
You don’t like dogs?

---

### JANE:
I don’t like pick up the poop.

---

### LUNA:
Ha! Yeah I can see that, funny I don’t mind it? What about cats, do you like cats?

---

### JANE:
Cats okay.

---

### LUNA:
Yeah maybe I’ll get a cat. I like dogs better but I look at this apartment

---

and I think boy Paco wouldn’t like it here, compared to home? 

---

This maybe isn’t the best kind of life for a dog, living in an apartment, always on a leash. 

---

I don’t think Paco ever wore a leash even once in his whole life. 

---

And he’s been a part of our family since I was a little girl. 

---

He’s super old now, he must like 16 or 17 at least. 

---

When I left, he was the last person I said goodbye to. 

---

Or I guess he’s not a person but you know what I mean. 

---

And I realized boy this dog is so old, probably he’s gonna… 

---

you know, probably he’s gonna die soon.

---

### JANE:
Oh.

---

### LUNA:
And probably I won’t be there when he does.

---

Why am I saying this?! Hoy I’m such a drag! I’m sorry sorry!, 

---

I’ll shut up now, let’s have more wine. More wine?

---

### JANE:
No no no, oh no, I am not using to drink so. 

---

No, my face it – you see, turning red already.

---

### LUNA:
Stop it your face looks great.

---

### JANE:
Ha no, I have to get good rest, when husband come home cannot be ah, you know, stinky. 

---

Make breakfast, long time in hospital, need to be yes, responsibility.

---

### LUNA:
Okay.

---

### JANE:
But you can drink! Drink more! Drink many! I like.

---

---

### LUNA:

### JANE:

---

---

---

### JANE:
You have nice family.

---

### LUNA:
Too many moustaches.

---

How did you and your husband meet?

---

### LUNA:
Nothing, no. I just.

---

Except yes, actually yes, I was gonna ask:

---

Do you ever wonder.

---

What did I do, did I really did that? 

---

Like I look at my husband and I know I married him because he… because I wanted to. 

---

But. Like if you met someone who didn’t have… 

---

let’s say a job or a future you’d say no thank you sir 

---

but if that same person somehow then they got a job 

---

and a future you’d maybe give him a chance?, 

---

and when you give him a chance then bam one day you look at him 

---

and say yeah okay chance worked out, 

---

I can see it okay let’s get married and stuff, 

---

well even if you didn’t get married to the guy because of the job 

---

and the future you still kinda back of your mind know those things… they mattered?

---

And so you can’t tell yourself anymore they don’t matter?

---

### JANE:
What?
 

---

### LUNA:
Ha! Nothing, I just. You’re right I’m silly, it’s just a silly… But anyway hey.

---

Is it… is it what you expected?

---

[They Laugh loudly]

---

What did you expect?

---

### JANE:

### JANE:

---

### LUNA:
Oh so true!

---

### JANE:
But, uh. You say you like to know about news, yes?

---

### LUNA:
I do! I try anyhow, to pay attention yes, 

---

I have a sister back home don’t tell anyone kay because she’s a… 

---

A communist.
 

---

### JANE:
Mm.

---

### LUNA:
Yeah, she’s my older sister so when I was a kid 

---

and stuff! she’d always talk about it, mosta my friends in school 

---

none of em were too interested interested but my sister 

---

well here’s the thing, first of all she made it all seem kinda cool? 

---

Ya know? The way everything an older sister does seems super cool? 

---

But then I really started paying attention because the things she said, 

---

about what was gonna happen in Philippines, well they started coming true.

---

No foolin. They all started happening!, 

---

and I don’t just mean little things and things, but like big things, 

---

big important scary things like martial law and suspension of constitution and all that, 

---

so. Back home mosta my friends and family where I come from they’d be like 

---

ay nako so what?, government it’s always corrupt no surprise!, 

---

but I guess it felt surprising to me. 

---

Also I worry about my sister yeah?, 

---

cause if your sister’s a communist in the Philippines 

---

you kinda gotta worried she might get ya know 

---

### JANE:
Mm.


---

### LUNA:
Oh gosh I didn’t offend you just now did I, 

---

maybe you hate communists, stupid girl why do I say such a thing!

---

### JANE:
Ha! No it’s okay!

---

### LUNA:
I gotta remember nobody likes talking bout communism!

---

### JANE:
Luna!

### LUNA:
What?

---

### JANE:
My sister, she communist too!

---

### LUNA:
NO SHE’S NOT.

---

### JANE:
Yes!

---

### LUNA:

Wait though you didn’t say you had a sister!

---

### JANE:
I know.

---

### LUNA:
You said you had a brother you didn’t say you had a sister?

---

### JANE:
Yes first time I don’t say her!

### LUNA:
But I guess every family’s got one!

---

### JANE:
Ha!

### LUNA:
A communist I mean, not a sister!

---

### JANE:
Yes but my sister I didn’t say her first time because she died.

---

### LUNA:
Oh no.

### JANE:
Yeah.

---

### LUNA:
Oh I’m such a dummy I gotta put my foot in mouth I’m so sorry!

---

### JANE:
Is okay is okay, long time ago.

---

### LUNA:
Oh no wait was she

---

### JANE:
No she were got hit by a bus.

---

Or maybe no. Maybe yes? But maybe no.

---

Hit by bus this is anyway, this is what they tell to us is happen.

---

But of course yes bus. There are many bus in Korea. So is possible, very possible.

---

### LUNA:
Jane I’m so sorry.

---

### JANE:
No no be sorry.

---

What your sister think about you come to America?

---

### LUNA:
She was happy? I think so anyway. She says she’s happy for me, anyway 

---

I guess if you’re communist you’re probably not gonna like America much?, 

---

but then again I guess an older sister’s gotta like it their little Luna’s someplace far away from Marcos.

---

You know she told me this something, I guess they passed a law here in USA, 

---

this law what made it so we can come here, you know what is it?

---

### JANE:
Law?

---

### LUNA:
Yeah my sister says they call it the Hart Celler Act 

---

because somebody whose name is Hart and somebody whose name is Celler 

---

they wrote this thing and it got made into law and stuff, 

---

just a few years ago and I guess before it happened hardly nobody could 

---

come from Philippines or from Korea or noplace where there’s people like, you know, like us?, 

---

before it everybody who’s coming to USA they come pretty much just from Europe and white people places, 

---

but after Hart Celler all of a sudden we can come here. 

---

Our husbands anyway, they can come here to study. Work and study.

---

### JANE:
Hart Celler?

---

### LUNA:
I know. When she told me I pictured this… 

---

it’s silly I know but I pictured this little old lady with a little stand 

---

on the side of the road selling hearts. All kindsa hearts, little paper hearts 

---

and plastic toy hearts, red with lacies and doilies.

---

### JANE:
American lady?

---

### LUNA:
That’s the funny thing!, she wasn’t American but a little old lola, 

---

and it wasn’t even in America but right down the street from our old house!, 

---

like it was there one day when it wasn’t before, 

---

and because these guys Hart and Celler I could just go down there and take my pick.

---

### JANE:
Wait for real?

---

### LUNA:
Ha!, no not for real, just imagination.

---

But I had this… another im  age? I was at the airport, when we came here?, 

---

not this airport, but the one to Disneyland where we got to first, 

---

we landed and they put us in this big big room, I’m sure you know it, 

---

all the people from flights coming in from other countries, they’re all there together 

---

and I look around and see these folks from everyplace and I think about Hart Celler, 

---

but this time it’s not some little old lady but a big line of people all waiting to get checked in, 

---

and I was looking at all the USA police, though I guess they’re not police but immigration workers, 

---

they’re looking over everyone’s papers and 

---

actually never mind this is kinda too sad a story I don’t wanna be this kind of sad right now.

---

### JANE:
Huh?

---

### LUNA:
Never mind my silly story! Let’s talk about something else, huh?

---

### JANE:
Luna you crazy what’s matter with you, no way you having to finish!
 

---

### LUNA:
Nah.

---

### JANE:
Oh my god Luna, finish sad story!

---

### LUNA:
It’s not even really sad just imaginary sad!

---

### JANE:
I don’t care, you start story you finish story okay?!

---

### LUNA:
Okay! Okay. So. Um. I just watched all these people. 

---

Coming to America. Going to the front, standing and waiting 

---

while these immigration officers look at their papers, 

---

and I imagine them saying okay sir papers look okay, now give me your heart. 

---

And then each by each these people they dig into their chest 

---

and they take out their heart and pass it over. 

---

That this Hart Celler it’s not somebody who’s gonna give you a heart, 

---

but we’re the heart sellers. It’s us, it’s our hearts, and we sell em away.

---

### JANE:
You’re right this is very bad story.

---

### LUNA:
I told you!

### JANE:
Oh my God Luna!

---

### LUNA:
I tried to stop! Your fault!

---

### JANE:
Okay my fault, my fault yes!

---

[They laugh]

---

You know, sometime I am think. If I was… If I was a man. 

---

I would be good at this. I would. Hm. I don’t how is best way to say.

---

### LUNA:
I think I know what you mean.
 

---

### JANE:
How to make best of. Choices. Man have so much more choices. 

---

So much times, I see man is make worser one. And so I think. 

---

If I am a man. Man, but with still my brain. With my feeling. I make better one.

---

### LUNA:
Yeah.

---

### JANE:
But then maybe if I am a man, I make bad choice because if I become man, 

---

then I become all of sudden so bad at make choice? I don’t know.

---

### LUNA:
Ha!

---

### JANE:
But my husband, you know, sometime he make such wrong choice I think how… 

---

how this man? How this man think?

---

### LUNA:
Like what kind of choices?

---

### JANE:
No nothing, is not important.

---

But point of story is. Richard Nixon! Oh my God how so stupid he is!

---

### LUNA:
I know right?!

---

### JANE:
When man is have power. Yes? Why?... Why they…?

---

### LUNA:
They don’t know what to do with power!

### JANE:
No!

---

### LUNA:
Why why then do they want so much anyway!?
 

---

### JANE:
If I am Richard Nixon I mean God I am think I have best job, 

---

wife so much more pretty than me, how I even get such pretty wife, 

---

I have so ugly face and things?, power of nice country and 

---

---

---

---

---

---

---

### JANE:

---

### LUNA:

---

---

### JANE:
Only sports I know, I know soccer.

---

### LUNA:
You play soccer?

---

### JANE:

---

My father, yes, when I am elementary school time he was teacher? 

---

High school teacher, yes, so for this school he teach, 

---

they have soccer team, and he um… coach, you know what is coach, am I say right?

---

### LUNA:
Oh my goodness yes, that’s so cool!

---

### JANE:
Yes coach for boy soccer team. But most of time they lose. 

---

Not good team. This school, my father, he teach school good for academic, but no for soccer.

---

### LUNA:
But still, that’s so exciting!
 
Yes.

---

### LUNA:

And so he taught you soccer?, you have to teach me!

---

### JANE:
Oh no, he no teach to me. Because… mm. When I am grow up, 

---

even when there is chance for me do something like this, my father he wanting always do just safe choice. 

---

Soccer game maybe too rough, this is not right thing for girl? So just I watch. And pretend play.

---

### LUNA:
Oh.

---

### JANE:
My mother my father, after they are die, I understand more? 

---

They think best way to protect, yes? When they are same age like me, 

---

they live such hard time, so only want for me do safe way, protect me.

---

### LUNA:
But look at you now.

---

### JANE:
Mm, yes.

---

### LUNA:
What do you think they’d say if… if they could see you now, in America?

---

### JANE:
I don’t know. Sometimes America, you know, seems like big adventure. But sometimes seems like…

---

### LUNA:
The opposite?

---

### JANE:
Yes sometimes seems like safe way. Because just I am do same like everybody say is best way. 

---

Whole my life, prepare for become best wife, good support, 

---

follow husband even to most far place can imagine, yes?

---

### LUNA:
Yeah.
 

---

### JANE:

---

### LUNA:

---

### JANE:
Okay, anyway!, so. If. If we leave. Where we go?

---

### LUNA:
Paris France. The Louvre.

---

### JANE:
Yes!

### LUNA:
YES!

---

### JANE:
This is not safe choice!

---

[They Laugh]

---

### LUNA:
I don’t feel safe.

---

### JANE:
I know.

---

### LUNA:
Back home I felt like people, we had the same… we came from the same place huh?, 

---

so I felt. What is it? Confidence, yeah. That if something happened. 

---

If something bad. Then I could count on someone to care. But here. 

---

I don’t have to tell you. I’m sure the things that happen to me, 

---

these things that happen every day, the way people… 

---

the way they talk the things they say the way they look at… 

---

I’m sure they happen to you too, yeah?

---

### JANE:
Mm.

---

### LUNA:
So it’s the opposite. The opposite of confidence.

---

### LUNA:
I would like to take you to the Louvre. But this is not my really real answer. 

---

My really real answer is that if we left for really real we would go to a place I saw once in the countryside.

---


When we first came here, from the airport, at one point, 

---

we pulled off the highway to some kinda side road?, and I saw this place. 

---

I didn’t see it all at once. First a little barn it was?, 

---

and I said oh lookit such a cute little barn, fresh paint, it was yellow and I never saw a yellow barn before. 

---

And then we passed a little garden, so full of flowers like you couldn’t imagine, 

---

purple pink yellow and the deepest red any person’s ever seen. 

---

Then a basketball thing you know whatsit called, hoop, on the side of a house and children. 

---

Laughing children and now I’m sitting straight up in my seat, yeah, 

---

and looking out the window of the car like I’m on a Disneyland ride, but it’s real life. 

---

I see a little market off the side of the road, buckets and baskets of corn carrots even pumpkins 


---

and then we turn the corner and there are all these people, all gathered around. 

---

I look around to try and find what is it these people are here for?, and then I see it’s a band. 

---

A band playing music and I can hear it so faint only through the car window, 

---

it’s a music I never heard before, and the people they’re dancing 

---

and there are kids on the shoulders of their parents and they’re clapping and swaying with the music, 

---

and the car it passes so slow. So slow I can hear just enough of the song to remember a few seconds of it today, like:

---

[Luna hums the tune]

---

And as we pulled away, we passed a big open field, and there were still more people. 

---

There were children just running. And dogs, without any leashes, running side by side with the kids, 

---

but we passed it too quickly. Too too quickly, but I  saw enough to know these children 

---

with their dogs weren’t running to anywhere in particular. They were running in a circle, 

---

they were running just to run. Because they’re already right where they’re supposed to be.

---

This place. I know it can’t be like this always, I know it was some special day, 

---

some special situation in the town and I know if I go there probably 

---

it’s not the same kind of fun for a goofy Filipino girl who’s super ignorant of their particular music, 

---

but I think about it just the same. 

---

I think about what it would feel like to be in the middle of it. To be a part of it somehow.

---

### JANE:
You tell this your husband?

---

### LUNA:
Yeah.

---

### JANE:
He should take. Go.

---

### LUNA:
He doesn’t… he. He doesn’t trust the countryside.

### JANE:
Mm.

---

### LUNA:
He’s heard bad things about

### JANE:
Mm-hm.

---

### LUNA:
About how they. For people like us, what they. 

---

Anyway, it’s probably good advice.

---

### JANE:
You and husband, you talk about what you gonna do after residency?

---

### LUNA:
Sometimes. Yeah, not as often as we should.

---

### JANE:
What you think gonna happen?

---

### LUNA:
Well, we talk about maybe we’ll go home.

---

### JANE:
Back to Philippine?
 

---

### LUNA:
But we won’t.

### JANE:
No?

---

### LUNA:
No. Even if things are better over there when he’s finished, we still won’t go back. 

---

Because he’ll become a doctor, and he can already see the way doctors live here; 

---

he knows how doctors live back home and how can somebody resist the difference?

---

### LUNA:
And so I’ve seen what happens, he’ll go where they tell him to go, 

---

they’ll tell him which such and such place will take him, and we’ll move there; 

---

he’ll work long hours and every holiday. 

---

And maybe if everything goes how they say it’s gonna go, we’ll have money.

---

All of a sudden we’ll be people who have money? Which maybe it will but how can we trust this, right?, 

---

how can we trust that everything’s gonna go the way they say it will when everything is different than we thought it would be, 

---

when it rains and I say this, no this isn’t rain, it doesn’t smell like rain 

---

so then how can I trust what they say is true? 

---

And anyway, I’ll make babies, 

---

and those babies will be babies who grow up with parents who have money, 

---

and they will be more American than I am, 

---

and I’ll struggle to make them understand where they come from. 

---

I won’t understand how to love them the same way my mother loved me, 

---

because they won’t understand me the way I understand my mother. 

---

My mother won’t understand me either, because I’ll change too, 

---

I’ve already changed I can feel it, I changed the minute I stepped off the plane, because I sold it, my heart, 

---

I sold it didn’t I?, I sold it to the man at the place in the room in the airport, 

---

and I can’t ever get it back, and without my heart my old heart my real heart 

---

my heart my heart I will stop understanding my mother, my communist sister, 

---

my home, my past, more and more every day until there’s no one left who understands me. 

---

No one left. Not even myself.

---

---

never profited from public service. I have earned every cent. 

---

And in all my years of public life, I have never obstructed justice. 

---

And I think, too, that I could say that in my years of public life,
