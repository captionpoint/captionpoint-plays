["Our Song" plays softly]

---

[The sound of heavy breathing]

---

[Ropes creak as the blade of the Guillotine rises]

---

[Gasp]

---

## OLYMPE:
Well that's not a way to start a comedy. 

---

With an execution? 

---

That's just basic dramatic writing: 

Don't start with beheadings. 

---

Audiences don't want plays about terror and death 

---

no-they want...hope. 

---

Yes, I have to write about... grace and power in the face of crisis. 

---

Artistic defiance, Yes. That's good. There we go. 

---

OK, what if I write a play 

---

that is the voice of this revolution, 

---

but not the hyperbolic, angry-yelling kind. 

---

I will write the wise and witty kind that satirizes and inspires 

---

and says to the held breath of a rapt audience...something...profound. So yeah. 

---

We're gonna have to cut the guillotine. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Cut that thing! Serves it right.

---

## OLYMPE:
Oh my god, Marianne! 

---

## MARIANNE: 
I know this is crazy to just show up like this but hello and surprise! 

---

## OLYMPE:
Hello and surprise! Oh my god, for a second I thought you were the national guard. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Are they coming for the writers already? 

---

## OLYMPE:
Only the important ones. I should be fine. 

---


Come in, come in. What are you doing here? 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Many things including, I hope, staying with you.

Is that OK? 

---

## OLYMPE:
Of course! Oh my god. Stay as long as you need. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Thank you thank you. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Don't thank me. I'm so glad to see you. 

---


I thought you went back to the Caribbean. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Vincent went back, I stayed in Nice. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Ooh Nice is nice. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
For some. For me? A lot less beach and a lot more political reconnaissance. 

---

## OLYMPE:
What does that mean? 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Gathering intelligence to send home. 

That's why I'm back. 

---


Things are heating up and we need an eye in Paris and I'm it. 

---

## OLYMPE:
So wait. I've been restarting the same play for a month while you became a damn spy?! 

---

## MARIANNE:
I mean... 

---

## OLYMPE:
Girl. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
I know. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Look at you! 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Well, we decided we needed our own intel, 

---


really tap into the political machines 

---


or we'll never figure how to break them.

---

## OlYMPE: 
You are my spy friend! 

God, you make me so much more interesting. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Well, don't get comfortable, I'm also here because I need you. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Playwrights love hearing that. It's so rare. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
I need you to write for us. 

---


Pamphlets, articles, treatises about slavery— 

---

## OLYMPE:
Monologues? 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Abolition human interest stories. 

---

## OLYMPE:
But as monologues? 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Just-sure. Help us! You're the best writer I know. 

---

## OLYMPE:
How many do you know? 

---

## MARIANNE: 
So many. 

---


And you can help people understand what we're fighting for, freedom, justice, humanity, come on. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Of course I'll help! But why don't you write this? 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Because I'm a better spy than I am a writer. Please. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Yes. I'll write anything you want...

---


as soon as I write my play. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
The play you can't even start? 

---


I'm rebelling against slavery and you're battling writer's block. 

---

## OLYMPE:
I'm not blocked. I'm just...mentally...hibernating. 

---


There's a lot of pressure to write something profound these days. And then I keep thinking 

---


if I come up with a good title it'll get me started. 

---


Something tantalizing but really vague like...

---


"The Revolutionists." 

---

## MARIANNE: 
You could do better. 

---

## OLYMPE:
I know. Nothing's working. 

---


There is drama everywhere you look these days, 

---


why can't I write any of it?! 

---

## MARIANNE: 
You can! Pamphlets! For me!

Write the truth that needs writing. 

---

## OLYMPE:
But that's your truth. Which I will totally write, 

---


I will, but I also really need something of my own. 

---


I need a play that's good and important and annoyingly prescient. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Then write the truth of an artist staring down a civil war. 

---

## OLYMPE:
And end up with a play about a playwright writing a play? 

---


I'd rather watch a guillotine. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
So would everyone. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Would they? Dammit. Back to guillotines. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
That's not what I meant. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Setting: Now. Paris, France, 1793. 

Guillotines are very big these days. 

---


Actually they just came out with small ones too, for kids to kill mice and for wives to make salad. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
That's so messed up. 

---

## OLYMPE:
It is. Everything is. 

---


Which is why the people's revolution has risen up with force enough to remove the king from power- 

---

## MARIANNE: 
and from his own head. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Exactly. Danger, unrest. 
An epic battle for freedom and peace- 

---

## MARIANNE: 
For white men. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Exactly. Which is why my play...  

---

could be about women showing the boys how revolutions are done. 

---


Yes! Fighting for their rights to life, liberty, and...divorce. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Divorce and decapitation? I hope it's better than it sounds. 

---

## OLYMPE:
It's comical yet quite profound 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Just doesn't sound like comedy

---

## OLYMPE:
I know, but that's what it could be. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
You know it's always in the timing,

---

## OLYMPE:
Are you hearing all this rhyming? 

Maybe I'm writing a musical!

---

## MARIANNE: 
Oh god, no one wants a musical about the French Revolution. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Probably right. How about a solemn, bracing political exposé - 

---

## MARIANNE: 
You're losing me. 

---

## OLYMPE:
How about a thrilling, hilarious political exposé that will gather us as one community, 

---


to be inspired by great French art and - 

---

## MARIANNE: 
To boo at whichever new play they want. 

---

## OLYMPE:
They did not boo my play. The abolition one from last year? 

---

No. That sound was the natural cathartic release from years of repressed racism and misogyny. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
So you're writing fantasy now? 

---

## OLYMPE:
The people leapt to their feet. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
And to the exit. 

---

## OLYMPE:
To tell their friends. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
That it was... "interesting." 

---

## OLYMPE:
My plays piss off just the right kind of people thank you very much. 

---


Excuse me for trying to do something revolutionary during this revolution. 

---

This is our time to make a better world for everyone...

---

who sees my plays. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
You're always so close to selflessness. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Thank you. See now you've got me thinking. 

---


What about a passionate socio political comedy about women's rights and -

---

## MARIANNE: 
A feminist comedy? Girl, don't. 

---

## OLYMPE:
OK, what if my play starts out as a comedy, 

---


but it'll end as a drama. That's fresh, right? 

---


We don't even have a word for that but- 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Like... "Life"? 

---

## OLYMPE:
Just go with me on this: 

---


At first the play is witty and fun, 

maybe some puppets. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Why do you always add puppets. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Because! 

---

## MARIANNE: 
You might as well go back to the musical. 

---

## OLYMPE:
OK I'm trying to do something important here. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Which is maybe why it's sucking so bad. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Sometimes conviction sucks. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
I'm just saying that nobody wants to be told what to feel. 

---

## OLYMPE:
I'm not telling them what to feel, 'm forcing them. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
That's what pamphlets do! 

---


Look. Most people don't have time for the grand dramas, 

---


it's the intimate ones that matter. 

---

So write your political theatre but remember 

---

that for most people it's not about being righteous, it's about being real. 

---


So find the heart. Not the...art. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Why are you better at this than me? 

---


I've been trying to come up with a cute couplet like that for days, 

---


but I keep dreaming of guillotines and resorting to puppets.

---


I have to write something! This is a revolution! 

---


Everyone is making history without me! 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Listen- 

---

## OLYMPE:
 I can't listen when I'm whining. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
You're just blocked. Writers get blocked. 

It's not a tragedy. 

---


Being ripped from your country,

stuffed in the belly of a ship,

carted across the world, 

---

and forced to break your back to make sugar

for French pastries is a tragedy. 

---


The French are fighting a revolution for freedom while running a slave colony in the West. 

---


That's why I need you writing pamphlets so we can expose the immoral and hypocritical actions that -

---

## OLYMPE:
 Oh my god I can write about you! 

---

## MARIANNE: 
was not the point I was going for. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Yes! You're gorgeous, and empowered, and seem to have a very clear character motivation. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
We're not gonna stay friends if you write a play about me. 

---

## OLYMPE: 
Marianne Angelle: Activist for freedom from slavery in the Caribbean, 

---


lover of cheeses and universal human rights, 

---


strong yet sardonically sympathetic. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
No, she said, sardonically. Pamphlets. 

---

## OLYMPE:
I am! I will! It will be great research for the play. 

---


What you're doing is bold and important. 

---


You're a goddamn spy for freedom! 

---


That's box office gold! 

---


Come on. You make me believe that a 

better world is possible. 

---


If people listen to you. And a lot of me. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
OK they say write what you know, right? 

But what if you write what you want. 

---

That's what we're really fighting for isn't it? 

Women's agency over their own lives. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Yes. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
The abolition of slavery across the planet. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Yes. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Maybe you don't need to dress your ideas in drama.

---

You can write a monologue? 

Why don't you write a manifesto. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Or a declaration? 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Sure, yeah. Like the Americans. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Like the Americans! 

"We hold these truths and-the-fact-that-women-are-people to be self-evident." 

---

## MARIANNE: 
That sounds pretty revolutionary to me. 

Also no risk of puppets. Everybody wins. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Marianne. Do you dream of guillotines? 

Every night? 

---

## MARIANNE: 
No. Chains. 

---

[Knock, Knock, Knock]

---

[knock-knock-knock-knock-knock]

---

## OLYMPE:
Who's there? 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
Who's...there? 

---

## OLYMPE:
Well. You're the one at the door, who are you? 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
You're obviously at the door too, and I'm here for a writer. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Did she say a writer? 

---

## OLYMPE:
I think that's what she said. 

---

## CHARLOTTE:
Yes it’s what I said, I said a writer, I need a writer, who is the writer and what’s my line? 

---


Are you a writer? If not are you a writer? 

This isn't a complicated question. 

---


Where do they keep the writers, I need a line.

---

## OLYMPE:
I'm sorry, you need a line? 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
That's what I said, but I don't care what I'd say, I wanna know what you'd say. 

---


Isn't that how this works? 

I need that to be how this works. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
And I need you to back the France off. 

What do you want? Who sent you? 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
I sent me and, I want some dialogue. 

That's what you do right? 

---


You're that real live lady writer guy? 

You write plays and stuff. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
And pamphlets about the rights of Caribbean slaves, which means she's very busy 

---

and we have no idea who you are or whose side you're on, 

---


also you're very loud and immediately unsettling, 

---


so why don't we do this another time and/or never. 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
I don't have time for another time and/or never. 

---


I have a guy to murder, 

which will land me on the scaffold, 

---


which is why I came to you, which is why, as I yelled upon arrival, I need a line. 

---


My actions will be talked about for centuries and I don't want to sound like a dingbat. 

---


I need something that will sink into their memories for all time, something with a lot of "fuck you" in it. 

---


So. Playwright. Write. 

---

## OLYMPE:
I mean...thank you for your enthusiasm but this isn't really my thing- 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
Come on. 

---


How many feminist playwrights do you think there are in Paris, 

---


One. You. 

---

## OLYMPE:
And trust me that turning down an opportunity to tell someone what to say is really hard for me 

---


but I'm already juggling a lot now. 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
Aren't we all: 

life, revolution, impossible beauty standards. 

---


Help me. 

---

## OLYMPE:
I'm trying to help a lot of people...

without leaving my office. 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
Please. It's rare to be in the company of like minds in like corsets, and I know you're a "writery" kind of writer. 

---


So. If you write it? 

---


I'll say it, I'll shout it, I'll sing it. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Sing it? 

---

## MARIANNE: 
NO. 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
YES. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Can you just gimme some context here. 

---


What exactly do you need written? 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
Last words. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Last words? 

---

## OLYMPE:
Like...for a toast? Are you going to a wedding? 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
No. I'm going to kill Jean-Paul Marat. 
By stabbing. Because he's awful. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
You're going to kill the journalist Marat? 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
Yeah. Because he's awful. 

---

## OLYMPE:
And by stabbing?! 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
Yeah. Because he's awful. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Ok. Well. Now I have to write a play about her. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
What about my pamphlets? 

---

## OLYMPE:
What about a torrid romance between a gorgeous assassin and a narcoleptic judge! 

---

## MARIANNE: 
No. 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
What? No. I need one line, 

not a whole (and obviously terrible) play. 

---

## OLYMPE:
No I'm really seeing this. 

---


A woman willing to risk it all for vigilante justice. 

Yes! 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Should you maybe ask her why she's going to kill this guy before you make her a hero? 

---

## OLYMPE:
I'm sure it's a good reason, look at that face. 

---


Now what if we call the play: "The Young Assassin.” 

---

## MARIANNE & CHARLOTTE:
Meh

---

## OLYMPE:
Or maybe just, "Stabbing: The Musical"! 

Oh, this is gonna be great.

---

## MARIANNE: 
Not anymore. 

---

## CHARLOTTE:
Hold on, is she quoting me? Are you quoting me? 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Oh, theatre people don't quote, they embellish. 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
Which would normally just be annoying, 

---


but this city is more than a little pissed off at the embellished 

---

or have you missed the last few beheadings. 

They don't like flourish. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Theatre isn't flourish. It's fundamental. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Here she goes. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Story is the heartbeat of humanity 

---

and humanity gets really dark when the wrong stories are leading the people. 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
Well I'm not here to make a story, I'm here to make history. 

---

## OLYMPE:
History is a story. 

Just with...an extra...“hi” 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Stop. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Hi, Story! 

---

## MARIANNE: 
We said no puppets. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Sorry. 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
I don't think I was being clear. 

I'm an assassin. About to assassinate. 

---

## OLYMPE:
And we'll get to that, but we have to do some character development first

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
I don't understand

---

## MARIANNE: 
It's all part of her creative process. 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
I did not sign up for this. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Because it's a new play

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
Oh god. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Set during the French Revolution! 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
I don't have time for- 

---

## OLYMPE:
Starring lots of furious women! 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
I said I do not have time for such frivolity, 

I need some last words, 

and I need to sharpen my knife. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Yeah. I'd watch a play about her. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Right? What if she wears a sparkly mask? 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
I'm not wearing a mask. I want people to know that I did it. 

---


Just. How long do I have to sit through this stupid play until we get to the murdering? 

---

## OLYMPE:
Well, the exposition, rising action, 

it'll probably be a while. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
While we're waiting you could tell us your name? 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
Right. Hi. Charlotte Corday. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Spot on Charlotte Corday, a soon-to-be-killer in revolutionary France. 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
Well don't say it like that. 

Not in that "You're a killer!" kind of way, 

---

Marat is a sick, fundamentalist, political pundit who has caused the deaths of thousands of innocent people 

---

with no tool as brave as a sword, no, he uses words. 

---

So really, I'm an editor.

---

## OLYMPE:
I wish I was that young and angry. 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
Thank you, but you don't seem to get that I am on a deadline. 

---


That is not a pun but it could be. 

---


And I'm sure this performing art we're in the middle of is lovely but not lovelier than justifiable homicide, 

---


and I'm not sure if this is the play or if we're still in the prologue, 

---


because plays are only for rich people and chandeliers and I'm on a damn mission to maim, 

---


so if we're not actively avenging, 

can we get to the pointy point? 

---

## OLYMPE:
It's not for rich people. 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
Theatre? 

---

## MARIANNE: 
I mean... 

---

## OLYMPE:
No. It's just...

---


I mean the chandeliers came with the space -

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
So did the starving peasants outside. 

---

## OLYMPE:
But I-no-the revolution just opened the theatres to the masses. 

---


Playwrights can finally write what they want. 

Theatre is democracy! 

---


Really pretty democracy with great hats and — 

---


Am I really writing for rich people? 

---

## MARIANNE: 
I mean... 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
Yes. The ones who aren't fled or dead. 

Vigilante mobs always ruin the party. 

---


Isn't theatre just another party? 

---

## OLYMPE:
No. It's culture. 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
Isn't culture just another party? 

---

## OLYMPE:
Culture is civilization! It's definitive, it lasts, 

the French are really into it! 

---

And I write pamphlets too, 

and we do a little community outreach and-

---

oh god you're right. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Ooh. She never says that. 

---

## OLYMPE:
But art is all I know how to do. Truly. 

---

I'm useless in the sunshine. 

Only theatre gives my soul -

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
Ohmigod is this going to be a play about a play? 

---

## MARIANNE: 
That is the worst. 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
That is the worst. Art about the rich is one thing, 

but art about rich people's art is too far. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Agreed. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Now wait just a minute, 

the performing arts are a vital part of -  

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
Art and anything else that fakes its way through this life is useless to real human beings trying to fix the goddamn world. 


---

## OLYMPE:
Well. It might be fiction, but it's not fake. 

---


The beating hearts in front of you are real. 

---


The gathering of people, the time spent is real. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Agreed. 

---

## OLYMPE:
The story is real when it starts. 

And this story will capture our hearts. 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
WHILE THE REIGN OF TERROR TAKES OUR HEADS. 

---


Which I saw them do. To a hundred of my neighbors in one day. Because Marat told them to. 

---


This revolution is not for the people anymore, 

it's for the zealots. 

---


They are taking over, and they are cruel, 

and you want to tell me a story? 

---


Do you see how insane that seems to a woman who is going to kill a man with her own hands? 

---


What the play is about does not matter. 

What is your life about? That matters. 

---


Because sometimes? 

One man, every once in a while, 

really needs to just die. 

---


Forget the line. I'll do it myself. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Are you in love with someone who doesn't love you back? 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
NoWhyWouldYouSay That? No. No. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
I sense the short temper of the unrequited.


---

## OLYMPE:
Oh that's what it is. 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
I AM NOT THAT. 

You theatre people--you are so loose. 

---

## OLYMPE:
I beg your -  That's accurate. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
So many egos, and tempers, 

and onstage heavily choreographed embraces. 

---

## OLYMPE:
It's bound to spill over. 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
Yeah. No. I'm gonna go. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Don't go now we just started liking you. 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
The nuns were right. Theatre is the devil's art. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Because we get to decide who the real heroes are. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
The clergy just hate that. 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
And. Who are the real heroes? 

---

## OLYMPE:
We are. If I'm writing it. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Stay. Your story's in good hands here.

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
I could stay for a sec. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Great. Now. My question is about plot. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Me too. You're just gonna walk up to him and stab him? 

---

I mean just, stabstab? 

---

## OLYMPE:
And because I'm seeing sequel potential, 

I'm worried about killing off our heroine so quickly. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Agreed. 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
No. I have to do this. 

---


I'm the only one with enough guts and cuteness to get away with this, so I will curl my hair, 

---

strap a steak knife to my thigh, 

use my sweet voice to infiltrate his house, 

---


stare him down and kill Jean-Paul Marat. 

With said steak knife. In his bathtub. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
His bathtub? 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
He lives there. Skin condition. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Ew. 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
No, it'll be great. Intimate. Bloody. 

---


The water swirling red, the nudity. 

---


It'll be so...dramatic. 

---

## OLYMPE: 
Aha! 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
Not like that. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Drama wins! 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
I said dramatic not theatrical. 

---

## OLYMPE:
All the world's an audience. 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
All the world's a mob. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Sometimes it's hard to tell the difference. 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
You know what? Never mind, I shouldn't have come. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Charlotte, stop. 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
No, no, the stories you trot out are distractions, 

---


and placating the rich, and full of yelling and bosom and terrible dialogue! 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Then why the hell are you here! 

---

You know that a good deed needs a good story or else it might vanish like nothing, ever happened. 

---


You know that or else you wouldn't have shown up. 

---


You also know that her words are dangerous, 

she is putting her life on the line -

---

## OLYMPE:
I am? 

---

## MARIANNE: 
To tell a story that is good and good for the world - 

---

## OLYMPE:
My life is on the line? 

---

## MARIANNE: 
She is risking everything for her art. 

---


So be nice to the playwright, because she holds fiction like you hold that blade and I know her weapon is sharper. 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
Than a knife? 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Than any metal you've got. 

You tell me which one you want running the world. 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
I mean. Sorry for the yelling. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Uh-huh. 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
And the aggressive entrance, 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Uh-huh. 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
It's just. You two might be the first women I've ever like...liked. 

---

You're...interesting in like a...human kinda way. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Thank you, young assassin. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Such a good title. 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
Do you mind if I hang here for half an hour until my appointment? 

---

You can maybe write my line while I practice my stabbing and scary eyes. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Also a good title. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Wait. You have an appointment to murder Marat? 

---

## CHARLOTTE:
Well he doesn't know that's what it's for. 

So don't let me get in your way. 

---


I don't know how this whole drama thing works. 

What do you - like - do all day? 

---

## OLYMPE:
Well. I guess I think up interesting people with enormous backstories and lots to lose and force them into action- 

---

## MARIE: 
Marie enters! Is she late? Or lost? 

---


What were they talking about? Was it her? 

It's always her. 

---


Or is she being her again? It's a confusing time. 

---


Hello. Marie-Antoinette. 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
Holy crap you're Marie-Antoinette? 

---

## MARIE: 
Isn't it exciting I'm So Famous. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Infamous. 

---

## MARIE: 
Famous. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Infamous. 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
Wait. You're the real Marie-Antoinette? 

---

## MARIE: 
I am so real! Sigh. 

Sometimes I say it instead of doing it. 

---


It used to be so good to be real. 

Or did they always hate her? 

---


Did she mention her general confusion about this? 

---


She has no idea what's coming next,

except that one day she woke up in a palace and went to sleep in a prison- 

---

not exactly prison - 

it was one of their lesser bedrooms 

---

with gunmen outside and no dessert! 

---


The fear in her children's fancy eyes, 

trying to explain it to the dogs. 

---


The pressure, the amount of sudden exposition. 

---


It's all too much for Marie! 

---

## MARIANNE: 
And everyone watching her. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Is there anything I can do for you, Majesty? 

---

## MARIE: 
I'm not even a "Majesty" anymore, the jerks. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
You're all Citizens now. 

---

## MARIE: 
But who wants a Citizen for a queen? 

That's ridiculous. I'm here for a rewrite. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Oh god. 

---

## MARIE: 
Yes girl I need some help. 

First step: Make me Majesty again! 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
Marat's the one who wanted to toss the monarchy,

It all goes back to him. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Exactly. There can be real reform without torching centuries of history. 

---

## MARIE: 
Thank you. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
But, come on, the royals aren't ready to change. 

---

## MARIE: 
No thank you. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
You aren't. You're dancing while Rome burns. 

---

## MARIE: 
First—It's Paris. 

---

Second—I had people dance for me. 

---

Third—We used to like me, the whole country would celebrate my birthday. 

---

How did it all turn into this rudeness and...murder. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
There's your title. 

---

## MARIE: 
Title? Whose title? I have so many titles. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Not that kind of title.

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
A play title. For a play. 

---

## MARIE:
A play play? Which play? I'll play! 

---

## MARIANNE: 
It's her play. She's writing it. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Yes. Olympe de Gouges, Your Majesty. 

Playwright, activist, you might have heard of my moving political dramas- 

---

## MARIE: 
That's cute, no, I've heard that you're the only lady playwright left in Paris. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
And you need to rewrite your history because it makes you look bad. 

---

## MARIE: 
Most of it does make me look bad! You're hilarious, 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Not on purpose. 

---

## MARIE: 
Which is still hilarious! 

---

You're pretty. And young. 

That must be fun. What are you? 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
An assassin. It is fun. 

---

## MARIE: 
And who is your funny friend? 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Marianne Angelle. 

---

Not funny, not your friend, 

and we need to talk about colonization in the Caribbean right now. 

---

## MARIE: 
Caribbean? Ohmygod I love you guys. Wait. 

---

Are you a? Like a real live? LikeASlave?

---

## MARIANNE: 
No. I'm a free woman. 

My husband and I came to France to demand full and recognized civil and political equality. 

---

We want slavery abolished across the entire French Empire. 

---

## OLYMPE:
I am so for that. 


## CHARLOTTE: 
Yes We Can!

---

## MARIE: 
You know it's the funniest thing, 

when I walked in here I could have sworn that you were my servant- 

---

## MARIANNE: 
I am a free woman of means like you and you and you. 

---

I am no one’s servant, I’m just standing nearby. 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
I like her so much. 

## OLYMPE:
She knows. 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
I like you so much. 

## MARIANNE: 
I know.

---

And you, Citizen, should know right now that the men and women of Saint-Domingue, 

---


who are dying in the sticky heat of your greed and oppression, 

---


the slaves who have suffered under your lash, 

have started a revolution of their own. 

---

## MARIE: 
Two revolutions? At once? 

Someone should have called ahead. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
It's the same revolution, the same rights,

the same freedoms, 

---

just applied to your slaves instead of your peasants. 

---

## MARIE: 
I don't remember any of the other colonies acting this way. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
We know you need us. 

You people love our sugar, and coffee, and indigo -

---

## MARIE: 
Indigo! For ribbons! 

---

## MARIANNE:
So we have leverage. A country of our own and you get your coffee. 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
Amazing. 

## OLYMPE:
Damn right. 

---

## MARIE: 
Your coffee is really good. 

---

I wish there was something I could do to help. 

---

But, I mean I couldn't even start a youth fitness program at the palace, 

---

and don't get me started on my rebranding ideas-which were good. I mean what is a fleur-de-lys? 

---

A sad flower? A terrible fork? 

---


No one listens to me unless I say something stupid, 

then it's the talk of the damn town. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
I feel your pain. 

---

## MARIE: 
Thank you. 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
That was sarcasm. 

---

## MARIE: 
I realize that now.

---

## OLYMPE:
WAIT. Wait. I've got it. This is it. 

---


This is it! The queen, can be in the play.  

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
My play? My play?! 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Oh hell no. What? Uh-uh. 

---

## MARIE: 
I would likely make it more interesting. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Olympe, No. 

You were writing about revolution not royalty. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Now wait, you said to write the intimate stories, 

that's what this would be. 

---


A woman at the edge of history, 

with everything to lose and nowhere to hide- 

---

## MARIE: 
Can it be a musical? 

---

## OLYMPE:
Under all that vanity she's still just a person. 

---

## MARIE: 
Just a fabulous person.  

---

## OLYMPE:
I mean it's not her fault that she's the queen. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Can we please not call her that anymore. 

She's not my queen and she shouldn't be yours.

She bankrupted your country!
 
---

## MARIE: 
I mean we reduced a lot. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
The people have no food, and she had a palace! 

---

## MARIE: 
So did the dogs-mini ones-hilarious.

---

## MARIANNE: 
She is everything wrong with a class of people so vacant-hearted that they can't see the horror of their own luxury. 

---

## MARIE: 
OK I had no choice in becoming royalty, 

it was thrown at me. 

---


And by that I mean a mountain of free stuff and undeserved compliments. 

---

What would you do? You'd take them. They're free. 

---

But just to be very clear, I did not say that bit about the cake. That was out of context. 

I thought I was ordering lunch. 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
Cake for lunch? 

---

## MARIE: 
Uh, all lunch comes with cake. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
And all cake comes with sugar 

and all sugar comes from families 

dying in the drowning heat a world away. 

---


Figurehead or actual head it's hers that should roll, not ours. 

---

## MARIE: 
I know what most people think of me. 

---


It's not very nice. And I deserve...some of it. 

---


And I have a feeling I might die sooner than later, 

---


but I would very much like Later to know that I was real person. 

---


Who bled and gave birth in a closed room 

with two hundred people watching 

so give me a little credit here. 

---


I just... I care. 

I care so much about my people and my country. 

---


I just need better press. 

You can do that for me Madame De Gouges. 

---

I was hoping that you would. 

I would be honored to be in your play. 

---

And try to earn your respect. 

Via meaningful connection... 

and minor revisionism. 

---

## OLYMPE:
I know I shouldn't but I kind of like her. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
She's not worthy, Olympe. 

She doesn't belong with us. 

She is not a revolutionist. 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
Yeah, what would your declaration be? 

---


"We hold these jewels to be self-evident." 

---

## MARIE: 
Well they are. 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
So shiny. 

---

## MARIE: 
Did you say declaration? Like the Americans? 

They do great declarations. 

---

I know Thomas Jefferson if you want any advice. 

He'd like you. 

---


Actually he'd like you. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
I feel like that should make me really mad. 

You need to go. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Wait-What if she could help us? 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Help us? Help us? No. 

---

## MARIE: 
I mean sometimes a revolution needs 

a woman's touch. 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
Or you know...stabstab. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
It does need a woman's touch, but that is 

not a soft thing, Citizen Cake. 

---

## MARIE: 
Oh. I know it's not. Not at night, not in secret, 

---


not when you're a tall, red-haired American diplomat in my goddamn country. 

---


Then it is a hard hand that knows your every weakness, 

---


and is firm and red and shuts you up and makes you sit 

---

and you better do what it says or else you're damn right there'll be a revolution. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
I mean...

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
She is kinda awesome

---

## OLYMPE:
Yeah, I kinda like her.

---

## MARIE: 
Question. 

Are there snacks? I'm used to a lot of snacking. 

Treats? Sweets? Anything? Nothing? 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
I have a mint.  

---

## MARIE: 
A mint! How darling. Merci, mademoiselle! 

---


Now tell us of our play, Madame De Gouges. 

---


## OLYMPE:
Oh. Well I haven't started writing anything just yet but -

---

## MARIE: 
Let the synopsis begin! 

---

## OLYMPE:
OK. Um. Well. Think of the power of a play that shows the entwined lives of real women -

---

[Wrapper Crackles]

---

Women who, even through their differences- 

---

[Wrapper Crackles]

---

join forces to protest the deep injustice of— 

---

[Wrapper Crackles]

---

## MARIANNE: 
That is so loud. 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
OHMYGOD, STOP. 

## OLYMPE:
Can you figure that out, Your Majesty? 

---

## MARIE: 
Sometimes good things make a lot of noise. 

---

## OLYMPE:
See? Musical. 

---

## MARIANNE & CHARLOTTE: 
No. 

## MARIE: 
Yay! 

---

## OLYMPE:
OK look. 

I don't know what I'm writing just yet, but I know that our voices deserve the stage. 

---


We deserve to be our own heroes, 

everyone's heroes. 

---


We're all of us more alike than we are different,

and if this revolution is what I think it is? 

---


This is our time to be known, and heard, and- 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
Oh crap I have to go kill a guy. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Come on, that speech was getting good. 

---

## MARIE: 
You're killing a guy? Which one? 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Marat in the bathtub with a steak knife. 

---

## MARIE: 
Oh kill him! I hate that man! 

He put my name on a list. With other people. 

---


Can you imagine? You know my husband, 

he always said Marat was a bloodlusty wacko. 

---


And then he chops my husband's head off. 

That shows how right he was. 

---

## OLYMPE:
OK but-Charlotte. What if you miss? 

What if he gets you first? 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
Steak knife pretty much always beats naked-guy-in-a-bath. 

---

## OLYMPE:
And he deserves it, but you don't. 

We don't want to lose you. Don't do this. 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
Then who will. The entire city is scared of him.

Well I'm not. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
That's right, girl. I got your back. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Marianne 

---

## MARIE:
Me too, me too! StabStabStab! 

---

## OLYMPE:
Would you stop encouraging her. 

I'm trying to save her life, 

---

because there is no doubt 

that she will die for this. 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
And that does not scare me. Not for this. 

I am not afraid to die for this. 

---

## OLYMPE:
What's that like? 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
Like knowing your lines. 

---

## MARIE: 
Does she love someone who doesn't love her back? 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
Why does that matter? God, that has nothing to do with

---

## OLYMPE:
Yes she does. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
That's what I said. 

---

## MARIE: 
Is it your tutor? Is his name Jacques? I know these things.

---

## OLYMPE:
Just wait, Charlotte. 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
No. Jacques knows what he did.

---

## OLYMPE:
I'm talking about Marat. 

The little assassination you're about to attempt. 

---


Have you really thought this through? 

Have you thought about Madame Guillotine? 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
Well yeah, who hasn't. 

---

## MARIE: 
I hate that bitch. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
It's the efficiency that most offends me. 

---

## MARIE: 
Too quick. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Too easy. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
They say its egalitarian. 

---

## MARIE: 
Bullshit, it's cheap. 

---

## OLYMPE:
I mean take some care. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
We're not cattle. 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
To them we are. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Carting you through the city to your doom. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
In a wagon. 

---

## MARIE: 
No grandeur. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Trash at you. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
They cut your hair. 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
They cut my hair? 

---

## OLYMPE:
Weren't you aware? 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
No! That's not fair! 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Maybe it could be a musical. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Just think about this. If you die? 

---


They could vilify you, call you witch or make him a martyr. 

---


Then it's like Marat wins. 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
Which is why you have to tell my story 

so they understand it. 

---


And do not let them cut my hair. 

---

## OLYMPE:
But. We didn't get you your last line. 

---


It might take a while, A long while. 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
Then I'm gonna have to go with: 

---


"May God have no pity, you motherfuckers." 

---

## OLYMPE:
Lemme work on that. 



---

## MARIE:
Hilarious! 

---

## MARIANNE: 
I mean... You could always sing. 

That's what I'd do. A song sticks. 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
A song? That's not a bad idea. 

---

## OLYMPE:
You said no musicals! 

---

## MARIE: 
What about the writer's last words? 

---

That must be a lot of pressure since that's kind of your thing. 

---

## OLYMPE:
I don't need last words, 
I am of the theatre, 
we just go on and on. 

---


And on. 

---

## MARIE:
 But you must've thought about what you'd say if they

---

## OLYMPE:
I DON'T KNOW. I don't know. 

---

## MARIE: 
Well, I do hope that my last words are sympathetic. 

---


I just don't want to sound silly because 

---


I AM STILL THE GODDAMN QUEEN OF FRANCE 
NO MATTER WHAT THOSE FUCKERS SAY. 

---


And I. Will die. Royally. 

---

Do you have another mint? 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
No. 

---

## MARIE: 
Shit. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Charlotte we can find another way to stop Marat-
a protest, a scathing farce- 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
Thank you, but...it's what you said. 
We're all in a play that someone else is writing. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Did I say that? 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
And I am certain that this is my cue. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
A word of advice, young assassin, 
aim high and strike deep. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Wait, Charlotte- 

---

## MARIE: 
And tie back your hair. 

---


I know a little about stabbing. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Charlotte. 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
Thank you, ladies. Gotta go make some... 

---


Hi, story. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
OK. I think this might be worth writing home about. 

---


You, keep writing. 

---


You, keep quiet. 

---

## MARIE: 
Enjoy your exit. 
Oh, the little murderer left her book. Plutarch. Parallel Lives. Hilarious. 

---



So - I generally just wait until someone comes to get me... 

---


Or I hear trumpets. I usually have to go if I hear trumpets. 

---


I'm good. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Uh-huh. 

---

## MARIE: 
Or maybe I'm not good at all. 

---


Is it hot in here or is that just...mortality. 

---


Or sudden lack of sugar. And coffee. 

---


And husband. Not a great king. But a man. 

---


He's at least a man, you know? 

---


You shouldn't need to be great to be spared. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Uh-huh. 

---

## MARIE: 
When did it all turn so cruel? 

---


Did I do this? Be honest, you seem honest. 

---


Is all of this because of me? 

---

## OLYMPE:
Not...exactly. 

---

## MARIE: 
But did I make it worse? I did, didn't I. 

---


Am I...too pretty? 

---

## OLYMPE:
Definitely too pretty. 

---

## MARIE: 
I thought so. Maybe if I change my hair, 
or perhaps less bosom? 

---

## OLYMPE:
That would be a public service. 

---

## MARIE: 
Ugh. God. 

---


It's always the women who have to do the changing, 
isn't it? 

---

## OLYMPE:
What did you say? 

---

## MARIE: 
Oh you know. Change this, Change that, 
Change YourEntire PersonalityAndAllegiance. 

---


What about what we want? You know? 

---


I could tell you a few things I'd like to change and they are not my last name. 

---


Now for the play, 
would you write me with different hair? 

---


I'd like to do my part for the cause. 

---

## OLYMPE:
I don't think...I'm going to write a play anymore. 

---

## MARIE: 
Oh. I thought this was scene one? 

---

## OLYMPE:
It was. And then it wasn't, then it was, now it's not again. 

---

## MARIE: 
That makes sense. 

---

## OLYMPE:
It does actually. 

---


Because we don't write what we know, we write what we want. 

---


And you're right, 
we don't need to change, they need to change. 

---

## MARIE: 
I'm right?! Gasp! 
Sometimes I say it instead of doing it. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Yes. I can't waste time on a play-
Marianne's right— 

---

A. Declaration! 
For the Rights of Women! 

---


I could just take Thomas Paine's declaration and switch the gender. 

---

Oh that's great. 
See? OK -  

---

## MARIE: 
I'm starting to think this might not be OK. 

---

## OLYMPE:
I will not only write this Declaration, 
I will declare this Declaration!

---

## MARIE:
Wait 

---

## OLYMPE:
Theatre and politics coming together! 

---

## MARIE: 
You thought they were separate? 

---

## OLYMPE:
I will go to the National Assembly myself, 
stand up and -

---

## MARIE: 
You're going to the Assembly? 
In person? On purpose? 

---


Girl. Hold up. They're awful, 
they're overrun by Jacobins, 

---


like frothy mean Extremists 
that killed my husband. 

---


They will not like this. 

---

## OLYMPE:
What good is a declaration if everyone already agrees? 

---

## MARIE: 
Yeah I'm really not seeing this ending well. 

---

## OLYMPE:
It never ends well unless you write the ending yourself. 

---


If I have the right to die by their hand,
I have the right to speak my mind. 

---


And I will. 

---

## MARIE: 
I mean... Sigh. 

---

<!-- BLACKOUT SLIDE -->

---

[Music plays]

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
It is to you, the good people of France, 
that I must define these actions. 

---

I am doing this with the full knowledge 
that I will be soon in the quiet arms
of Madame Guillotine, but...Jean-Paul Marat, 

---

by eight o'clock tonight, shall be dead. 

---

## OLYMPE:
When will women ask ourselves... 
What has this Revolution given us? 

---


And if the answer is nothing? 

---


When will we take it for ourselves? 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
Until Marat is silenced, you, my friends, 
will live in danger. 

---

So. 

---


I will avenge us all. 

---

## OLYMPE:
So. I now present this Declaration of the Rights 
of Woman and the Female Citizen. 

---


Article One: Woman is born free and lives equal to man. 

---

[Men boo and shout]

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
As the murderer Marat draws his final breath, 
there will at last be peace in France. 

---


You're welcome. Charlotte Corday. 

---

[Water splashes, Marat groans]

---

## MARIANNE: 
My dear Vincent, 

---


We fight for this better world together even
 if we are a world away. 

---


I fight harder with you in my heart. 

---


More news of the Paris revolution enclosed. 
Be safe and write soon. 

---

<!-- BLACKOUT SLIDE -->

---

## MARIE: 
So here's what I don't get. 

---


Isn't the definition of a revolution 

---


"the turning about of an object on a central axis
 thereby landing its journeyman in the same exact spot 
whereon they started"? 

---


Because that seems like a waste of everyone's time. 

---

<!-- BLACKOUT SLIDE -->

[Music]

---

## MARIANNE: 
It's happening. It's all happening. Olympe? 

---

## MARIE:
 Nope. Lady writer left a while ago. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
So. It's just...me and Marie-Antoinette. 

---

## MARIE: 
Is it ever just Marie-Antoinette. Ribbon? 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Why don't you keep it. 

---

## MARIE: 
Oh, I was going to. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Excuse me, I have to go do something useful.- 

---

## MARIE: 
Please Don'tLeaveMeľmScared. 

---


It's so...lively out there. 

---


Unless you're Marat. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Touché, Citizen. 

---

## MARIE: 
I made a touché?! I've always wanted to do that. 

---


Wait. That means she did it? She killed him? 

---


Did you see it? Was it awesome? She is such a badass. 

---


Or a crazy person. I mean, the chutzpah of that girl. 

---

And such good hair. Tell me everything. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
I mean... OK, she walks right in, front door, 
I'm watching from the street, 

---


it's quiet for a few minutes, 
and then I hear her yell "FOR FRANCE!," 

---


then this scream and splash, 
and the white curtains spackle red. 

---


Commotion in the house, the housekeeper wails, 
the authorities rush in, 

---

then they take a perfectly collected 

Charlotte Corday to prison in a cart. 

---

She was amazing. 
Perfect form, flawless execution. 

---

## MARIE: 
Touché too! 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Touché too.


---

## MARIE: 
I fear we shall not know the rightness of our revolutions

---


nor the heroes of our stories 
for generations to come. 

---

## MARIANNE:
 Uh. Yeah. Exactly. That was— 

---

## MARIE: 
Unexpectedly profound. 

---


It happens sometimes. 

---


And...you're, like, not a queen? 

---

## MARIANNE: 
No. Revolutionary. And a mom. 

---

## MARIE: 
A mom, me too! I forget about that sometimes, 
but I am. How old are your kids? 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Well Annabelle is ten. 

## MARIE:
Awww. Lots of bows? 

---

## MARIANNE: 
She loves bows. On everything-the cat, 
the teacups. 

---

## MARIE: 
Me too! Teacup bows are the best! 

---

## MARIANNE: 
And Vincent is eight. He's named after his dad. 

---

## MARIE: 
So are mine. Isn't it funny when they start talking alike – 
father and son? 

---

I just think it's so funny. 
They sneeze the same. 

---

They say "spoon" the same. Hilarious. 
And now sad. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
The world found it just despicable. 
No nation, no matter how revolutionary, 
should kill a king that way. 

---

## MARIE: 
Aw, thanks. I mean. He was a lumpy man, 
but he had good moments. I didn't dislike him. 

---


In fact I liked him, 
when he would just stand there looking serious. 

---


He was best when he was just...standing. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
How did you meet? 

---

## MARIE: 
On our wedding day. I wasn't supposed to marry him, you know. 

---


But all the rest of my sisters had smallpox 
so it fell to me. Which was fine. 

---


I mean the finery was exquisite. 
Everything else was a bit strained. 

---


You know we didn't consummate the damn thing 
for three goddamned years? 

---


Can you imagine? The tension? 
And the whole country blames me! 

---


And I'm like "nah uh! I'm totally down! 
He's the one who-" Turns out? 

---


He had to have an operation on his Little Prince 
before he could- Yeah. So that was anti-hilarious. 

---


Then finally little Marie-Thérèse came along, 

---


then little Louis-Joseph, then little Louis-Charles, 

---


then little Sophie poor dear. 

---

Then they killed him. 
In the square that used to be named after his grandfather. 

---


The rest is... I talk too much. 

---


What about your husband? 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Oh. We don't have to... 

---

## MARIE: 
No please tell me. 
It's so nice to pretend nothing is wrong in the world. 

---


Is yours a love story? I love love stories. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
It is a love story. 

---

## MARIE: 
Brava, then. Allons-y. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Well, Vincent is a catch. 

---

He's strong, and tall, 
with these eyes that just make you tell him every little thing. 

---

## MARIE: 
Ooh. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
And he doesn't walk. Oh no. Vincent strides. 

---


Long legs and swinging arms, you know. 

---

## MARIE: 
Uh-huh. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
And when that man wears a suit? Just give up, 
just don't even try to look away. 

---


But when he takes it off? 

---

## MARIE: 
TELL ME EVERYTHING. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
He courted me for months, but the truth is I thought he was too handsome. 

---

## MARIE: 
Too handsome is not a thing. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Well, you don't want them that dashing, 
it'd make me worry. 

---

## MARIE: 
Not me--Dash Dash! 

---

OK, Vincent is a dream, 
he swings his arms, when is le smooch? 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Well I kept thinking "yes, he's very nice" 
and "yes he's from a good family." 

---


But I just wasn't sure I really knew him. 

---


Until. He let loose this laugh.
We were talking about - I don't know- 
and out comes this rumbly, and loud, 

---


and big-old-stupid laugh.  

---


And that's when I agreed to marry him. 

---

## MARIE: 
That is literally hilarious! 

---

## MARIANNE: 
They're perfect when they're just a little flawed. 
You know? 

---

## MARIE: 
I do not know, but that sounds so fun! 

---

## MARIANNE: 
I miss him. And our kids, they're with my mom. 

---


Revolutions aren't for children. 

---

## MARIE: 
Work-life balance, I get it. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
It's hard. When Vincent went back to Saint-Domingue last month I...

---


I knew it was the right thing. 

---

But even when we're apart for a day. 
I miss him. 

---

## MARIE: 
What's that like? 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Like. Sending a letter to your best friend t
hat keeps getting returned. 

---

## MARIE: 
I don't usually comfort other people, 
am I doing it right? 

---

## MARIANNE: 
You're doing fine. 

---

## MARIE: 
Love letters lost...that is the saddest thing in the world. 

---

You know you could use one of my ships to find him? 

---

I think I still have some ships.
 
I used to wear them in my hair, little ones with sails and everything, 
which does seem a bit excessive in retrospect. 

---

Anyway, we'll find out what happened— 

---

## MARIANNE: 
I think... I think he might be dead. 

---

## MARIE: 
What? 

---

## MARIANNE: 
I think they might have killed him. 

---

## MARIE: 
Oh my god. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
I don't know if they did but I swear 
I can tell that something is wrong, 

---

is profoundly and terribly...gone, 
And I don't know what to do.

---

What do I do? 
Do I leave? Do I stay? 

---

What do I do?

---

## MARIE: 
I understand this feeling. Don't go. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
We each carry a final letter to the other 
in case something happens to one of us. 

---

So we know. 

---

## MARIE: 
This is his? 

---

## MARIANNE: 
No. Mine to him. I haven't seen his yet- 

---

## MARIE: 
Well there you go. Hope. 

---

Because we will not give up on him, 
we will find him. 

---

And I will help you 
with everything I have left, Citizen 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Thank you, Citizen Majesty. 

---

## OLYMPE:
GoddammitGoddammitGoddammit, 

---

I'm gonna let you ladies guess how my little solo show 
at the National Assembly went? 

---

## MARIE: 
Um... Poorly! 

---

## OLYMPE:
Poorly does not properly convey the reviews it received. 

---

They booed me. Hundreds of men booed me as I spoke. 

---

## MARIE: 
Well, what good is a declaration if everyone already agrees. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Well they could agree a little. 

---

How can these men hate a declaration of women's 

equality when that's exactly what Egalité is! 

---

## MARIANNE: 
But Fraternité it is not. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Goddammit. What the hell is this revolution about? 

---


Ugh. World changing should be easier. 

---

## MARIE: 
I mean, my wig choices have done it 
on numerable occasions, 

---


but we were just talking 
and Marianne is worried about- 

---

## MARIANNE:
Marie don't, just- 

---

## MARIE: 
What? 

---

## MARIANNE: 
There's no need to say anything- 

---

## OLYMPE:
What's going on? 

---

## MARIE: 
Her husband. 

---

## OLYMPE:
What about him? 

---

## MARIE: 
She's worried that something might have happened to him. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Marianne, what's she talking about? 

---

## MARIANNE: 
I...I haven't heard from him in weeks. 

---


Something's not right. 

---


I don't know anything for sure but- 

---

## OLYMPE:
Have you seen his last letter? 
The last letter he keeps for you? 

---

## MARIANNE: 
No, but- 

---

## OLYMPE:
Then I'm sure he's fine. 

---


You'd know if he wasn't. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Yes, but it's just strange that he hasn't- 

---

## OLYMPE:
Don't worry before there's a problem. 
THere's enough going on already. 

---


You should have seen the way those men 
at the Assembly glared at me. 

---


One guy threw a shoe. 

---


I mean it's so obvious what I was asking for 
and they wouldn't even hear me out.

---


Maybe I start killing people like Charlotte. 

---


That seems to make them listen. 

---

## MARIE: 
It's making people talk, not listen. 

---

## OLYMPE:
I just can't believe she actually did it. 

---

## MARIE: 
I can. That girl. She has some- 

---

## OLYMPE:
Conviction. 

---

## MARIE: 
Cheekbones. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Upper body leverage. 

---

## OLYMPE:
I wish I had her certainty. 

---

## MARIE: 
You mean cheekbones. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Ladies, I can't help but think this revolution 
might not be for us anymore. 

---


But I want it to be, 
I want to have faith in justice. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
I do. 

---

## OLYMPE:
In common sense. 

---

## MARIE: 
I do not. 

---

## OLYMPE:
In a good story. But what are they doing for us 
at the moment?  Not much. 

---


Makes me want to abandon everything 

---

## MARIANNE: 
No. Don't say that. You need to remind 

yourself what we're fighting for: 

---


conviction, sacrifice for the greater good. 

---


Come with me to see Charlotte. 

---

## MARIE: 
To a prison? Oh no. 

---


I'm afraid they'll never let me out. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Olympe, come on. She needs us. 

---

## OLYMPE:
She needs us to be implicated 
and die with her? I don't think so. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
She needs you to tell her story. 

---

## OLYMPE:
I will. From here. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
You're really that scared. 

---

## OLYMPE:
I'm not scared. 

---

## MARIE: 
You sound a little scared. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
And you cannot give up now, none of us can. 

---


Because it seems like it's going to get worse- 

---

## MARIE: 

A lot worse. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Before it gets better. 

---

## MARIE: 
Not that much better. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
And that's when this country 
is going to need us the most. 

---


Especially the writers. 

---


When they give up all is truly lost. 

---

## OLYMPE:
I mean I'd like to tell her story, 

---


I liked her, but it stopped being fun 
when she actually killed someone. 

---


Now it's totally different 
than I was going to write it. 

---


Reality messed up my narrative. 

---

## MARIE: 
I hate when that happens. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
You don't always get to pick the ending 
but it doesn't mean it's not a good story. 

---


She needs her friends now. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Well we really just met her. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
She needs a dramaturg. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Don't we all, 

---

## MARIANNE: 
She needs the last words you promised her. 

---

## OLYMPE:
OK. Give her this. 
If I'd had more time it would've rhymed. 

---

## MARIE: 
Is she good on ribbons? '
Cause I have a few extra if, y'know, 

---


that might beat back the tide of fate 
coming hard against us all. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
I'm just saying...

---


for a dramatist 
you seem awfully scared of drama. 

---

## MARIE: 
Ooh. 
Would you write me an exit line like that? 
I've always wanted to be like--

---


"blah blah blah RETORT" and then just leave 
and the scene is-like-over. 

---

<!-- BLACKOUT SLIDE -->

---

[Music]

---

[The sounds of a prison]

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
And after all the shoving and the yelling,
 they get me to the prison. And I'm exhausted right? 

---


And then they had to check my virginity, of course. 

---


And they were like "She's a virgin!" 

---


And I was like "not after you checked, I'm not.” 

---


And it wasn't the intimate violation of it that bugged me-

---


though I swear to god 
some guy hit on me on the way to prison-

---


It was that they were sure there was a man involved. 

---


"She wouldn't have avenged her people on her own,
 she must have been fucked into it." 

---


I mean Jesus Christ 
a girl can't even assassinate someone without judgment. 

---


I'm joining Olympe's group. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
What's Olympe's group? 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
I heard that she declared something at the Assembly. 

---


Some big women's group? 

---


For girls to go scouting or something? 

---

## MARIANNE: 
I don't think that's what she was- 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
Oh yeah, that's what they were saying in my virginity check. 

---

## MARIANNE:
No, it was a Declaration for all Women. 

---


Egalité means equality for everyone, 
that's her point. 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
Exactly what I'm saying! 

---


Who checks the boys' virginity 
when they go to prison for murder, 

---


huh? No one. 

---

That'd be equality, 
that'd be...something...good. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
You OK? 

---

## CHARLOTTE:
 Me? Fine. Good. I mean... I did the deed. 

---


Stabbity-Stab, he's dead, what I wanted. 

---


So...yeah. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
You know, they're calling you 
the Angel of Assassins. 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
Oooh. Really? That's not bad. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Yeah, kind of a girl-next-door-
meets-Joan-of-Arc vibe. 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
Nice. Wait. They think I'm crazy? 

---

## MARIANNE: 
No

---

## CHARLOTTE:
Because Joan of Arc was kinda crazy.

---


I'm not crazy. I fed up. I had to kill him,
it was a civic duty...the felt fuckng awesome. 

---


I mean the feel of it? Of righteous vengeance...

---


is just...floral, 
like a blooming of power and rightness and -

---


goddammit it's what sex must feel like.

---

## MARIANNE:
I mean...

---

## CHARLOTTE:
The way that man looked at me 
with my knife in his chest. 

---


I was this close to him,
his breath on my lips, 

---


leaning into him, and I said - 
I actually said this -

---


"You. Die. Now." 

---


But that's not crazy that's...

---


just very literal.

---

## MARIANNE:
I mean...

---

## CHARLOTTE:
Did I tell you 
that some guy's painting my portrait? 

---


That's kinda cool.

---


Wait until Jacques sees that. Fucker. 

---


And people are reading my letter?

---


That last line might have ben a bit much
but I didn't have Olympe's help.

---

## MARIANNE:
Yes, it's circulating in a pamphlet. Widely. But...

---

## CHARLOTTE:
What?

---

## MARIANNE:
There are some...celebration...for Marat.

---

## CHARLOTTE:
Wait? What?

---

## MARIANNE:
Now this was bound to happen, 
but some idiots are trying to turn him 
into a martyr.

---

## CHARLOTTE:
Some? I mean...not many...not some.

---

 
A faction. A small but vocal faction? Right?

---

## MARIANNE:
....right.

---

## CHARLOTTE:
Well. Sometimes history judges slowly.

---


My trial is tomorrow.

---

 
It'd be nice to see a familiar face.

---


I'm preparing my Steely Look of Unwavering Calm, 
but I might need a high-five before I go on stage.

---

## MARIANNE: 
You mean on trial.

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
Same thing. All the world's an audience. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Are you quoting Olympe at me? 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
Am I? Oh god. Never tell her this. 

---

## MARIANNE:
 I would never. And I'll be at the trial.

---

 
You're an example 
for us all to keep fighting,

---

 
do what we have to, 
even if it means being very...literal. 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
Would you. Please fight for me too. 

---


I don't think I finished the job. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
I don't know if we'll ever finish it. 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
But I don't even know if I helped. 
Like at all. What if I just made it worse? 

---


Oh god, am I crazy? Did I do the right thing? 

---

I mean I know technically murder is wrong 

most of the time but-oh god this is not-oh god - 

---

## MARIANNE: 
As a wise and weird woman once said:

---

 
We may not know the rightness of our revolutions

nor the heroes of our stories 

for generations to come.

---

 
But I think you're one of them.

---

 
And I will carry you into 
every fray I can find. 

---

[Steel doors unlock, footsteps approach]

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
OK tell people-tell them-I don't know.

---

 
I'm not great with words.

---

 
Tell Olympe to find the words. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
She found these. 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
For me? Really? 
Oh thank you, thank you. 

---

## MARIANNE:
 Don't thank me. Or her.

---

 
It was literally the least she could do. 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
No it's not.

---

 
It's everything.

---

 
Absolutely everything. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Now when you say that...

---

 
Look up, find your light, and say it loud. 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
OK. Um. I'm really scared. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Of course you are. And that's OK. 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
I'm so scared. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
I know. But don't let anyone else know it.

---

 
You're brave, and ready, and not alone.

---

 
Good work, young assassin. 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
Thank you. Thank you.

---

 
OK. OK.

---

## MARIANNE: 
OK. 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
OK.

---

## OLYMPE:
OK.

---

## MARIE: 
OK

<!-- BLACKOUT SLIDE -->

---

<!-- END OF PART ONE -->

---


---

[Music]

---

## OLYMPE:
OK, yeah, 
this is going to start moving really fast now.

---


Marat's death has made things very bad, 
very quickly.

---


The revolution has turned violent, 
anything done or said against the Republic 
is now treason and treason is punished by death.

---


There are mobs in the streets,
Marat's a martyr, Charlotte's on trial, 
and I've finally found something to write about--! 

---

## MARIE: 
Marie! OhMyGod, is that me Marie? 

The Queen Marie? The Me Queen?! 

---

## OLYMPE:
Yes, can you not yell all of your revelations 
as you have them. 

---

## MARIE: 
Gasp! Sigh! Retort! 

Oh that seems like such the right move. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Well the declaration was a bust and 

you're really interesting. 

---

## MARIE: 
Right? 

---

## OLYMPE:
Back to plays. Fiction I can fix. 

Reality is way too hard to write. 

---


At least drama has some structure. 

We're headed somewhere clear. 

Like actually good. 

---

## MARIE: 
And it's really about me? 

That's hilarious! 

---

## OLYMPE:
Actually, it's a very serious 
epic historical political drama

---


with a few songs that will be 
a vindication for generations! 

---


Because it will last five hours. 

---

## MARIE: 
Ugh. But the title. Something cute, 
something that says “She's Innocent!" 

---

Perhaps, "The Lovely Queen" 
or maybe, "Braveheart." 

---

## OLYMPE:
NO. It has to be sweeping and profound. 

Something like... "France Preserved”! 

---

## MARIE: 
Sounds delicious. 

---

## OLYMPE:
OK maybe... "France Saved" 

---

## MARIE: 
Oh that's nice. I'm thinking 

"Ooh, is France an ingénue tied to a train track? 

---


And what are trains?" 

---

## OLYMPE:
"France Saved; or, A Tyrant Dethroned." 

There we go, that's it. 

---

## MARIE: 
De-WhatNow? Dethroned? Who's dethroned? 

---

## OLYMPE:
I want a country that owns itself 
and I don't think we can do that 
with a monarchy so this play— 

---

## MARIE: 
Silence. No queen? That is not-no-wait. 

---


Do I die in the end? 

---

## OLYMPE:
Well I haven't written the end. 

---

## MARIE: 
You said "we're headed somewhere clear, drama has structure." 

---


Well where the hell are we headed 
and why is it not a beach? 

---

## OLYMPE:
Look- 

---

## MARIE: 
No you look. 
I'm the main character of this thing, right? 

---


So let's make me stay queen and not die, OK? 

Let's do that. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Sometimes the story tells itself. 

---

## MARIE: 
THEN YOU BETTER TELL THIS DAMN STORY TO BEHAVE. 

---


I have precious little time 
to force history to like me.

---


Now tell me what you're writing. 

---

## OLYMPE:
I don't have time to go back, 
I'm halfway through the story. 

---

## MARIE: 
Aren't we all. Tell me.

---

## OLYMPE:
Setting: 
The queen's private chamber in the palace 
on the eve of the fall of the monarchy. 

---

## MARIE: 
That's a bad day to set a romantic comedy. 

---

## OLYMPE:
It's not a romantic comedy. 

---


You're desperate. 

---

You're plotting any way to uphold 
the crumbling royal institution 

---


while the revolutionary forces are at your door. 

---

## MARIE:
Get away from the door Marie! 

---

## OLYMPE:
Then a woman comes to you, 
to convince you to let go of the old ways 

---


and embrace the new, to compromise. 

---


Her name is Olympe. 

---

## MARIE: 
Hold the throne. 
You're writing about yourself now? 

---

## OLYMPE:
It's a character. 

---

## MARIE: 
Named after you. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Well yes but- 

---

## MARIE: 
Isn't that confusing? I'm confused. 

I hate when theatre confuses me. 

---

## OLYMPE:
I call it "Meta Theatre." 

The point is to be a little confusing. 

---

## MARIE: 
I hate it. I already hate it. 

---

## OLYMPE:
You don't hate it. 

---

## MARIE: 
The play is trash! 

---

## OLYMPE:
The play could save us both. 

---

## MARIE: 
Comment?

---

## OLYMPE:
By showing you learning a goddamn lesson 
for starters. 

---

By showing people that revolutions 
needn't be so bloody. 

---


That they can be kind and creative. 

---


I'm telling you, Your Majesty, 
This play. Will be. Important. 

---

## MARIE: 
If it's not a romantic comedy 
nobody will come. 

---

## OLYMPE:
I'll add a butler. 

---

## MARIE:
 Hilarious! 

---

## OLYMPE:
Now, the first act ends with Olympe 
convincing the queen to work 
with the revolutionaries

---


to create a Constitutional Monarchy
that truly embraces Liberté, Egalité— 

---

## MARIE: 
Sororité. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Yes. 

The country is saved by its women. 

---

## MARIE: 
That I like. Keep writing. And if you want... 

the production may borrow my wigs. 

---

## OLYMPE:
I'll make sure to thank you in the program. 

---

## MARIE: 
It's finality that scares me most. 

---

## OLYMPE:
That's the hardest part.

Writing the ending. 

---

## MARIE: 
Oui. C'est vrai. 

That was my fear as a child.

---


Never seeing people again. Or dogs. 

---


How are you supposed to understand 
when you're so young? 

---


Never? What is "never"? 

Never is now, Young Marie.  Never might be now. 

---

## OLYMPE: 
I don't know, Your Majesty. 

Never might not come to you. 

---


You're a very compelling woman.

I'm the one that should worry. 

---


My attempt at immortality is on paper, 
scripts in actors' pockets. 

---


It's not as glamorous as it looks. 

---

## MARIE: 
Oh, don't worry, 

it doesn't look very glamorous, 

---


But I like your stories. 

I'll remember them. 

---


And I'll tell my grand-children 

and they'll tell their grandchildren, 

---


and their grandchildren will invent new ways 
to watch never-ending plays on ever-tinier stages. 

---


May I nap on you? 

---

## OLYMPE:
A play that doesn't end. 

---


If I'm writing what I really want? 

That'd be it. 

---

## MARIE: 
Then tell me that story, 
and let's not have an ending, shall we? 

---


A cliffhanger will do. 

---


Something that makes you want 
to come back for more and more and... 

---

## MARIANNE: 
They lied - there was no trial - 

Charlotte's headed to the scaffold. 

---


Right now.

## OLYMPE:
Oh god. 

OhGodOhGod, I can't watch this. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
You have to. 

---


If you don't capture it, they will. 

Write it down, Olympe. 

---

## OLYMPE:
I can't, I do fiction,

this is way too real. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
That's why you need to write it. 

---

## OLYMPE:
I need to stay alive, 
and that's becoming harder 
and harder because of her. 

---


She's made them scared 
and they're taking it out 
on half of the human race. 

---


Our half. 

We have to get out of here now. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
I'm not leaving her, 

and neither are you. 

---

## OLYMPE:
She doesn't need us now! 

---


All the sane people are leaving. 

Only the heartless wackos are left. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
And if you don't put the heart back 

in this revolution, who will? 

---


If you don't write this down, who will? 

They will. 

---


And that's how they win.

And you don't want them to win. 

---


So stay right where you are, buck up, 

and witness this. That's what she deserves. 

---


What we all deserve. 
You said we're the heroes 
if you're writing it. 

---


So write. 

---

## OLYMPE:
OK. Yes. OK. 

---


Scene: Charlotte Corday mounts the scaffold. 

---


The red thing creaking 
as she stands tall against the grain. 

---


The crowd is rowdy this morning. 

---


They heave fat words at her, 
they bark. But she is not marred. 

---


The hem of her white dress flips in the wind 
like a ring of small fish at her feet. 

---



I'm loving this narration, 
perhaps I should write novels.

Focus please.

The young girl, 
a fair and beautiful creature in white,

looks out towards the horizon, 
with posture braver and taller

than any man gathered below the scaffold 
to watch her...die... 

---


Oh god. I can't. I can't. I'm sorry- 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Olympe, don't— Uh. 
So. The executioner yells: 

---


"Does the condemned have any last words?"

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
Uh. Yes. I do... 

---

## MARIANNE: 
And. With confidence, and clarity, 

and a voice like a church bell 

ringing across the city-

## CHARLOTTE: 
I KILLED ONE MAN, 

TO SAVE ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND.

VIVE LA REPUBLIC! VIVE LA FRANCE!

I DIDN'T GIVE HIM GRAND-CHILDREN.

I heard them, they're coming for you, 
we have to- What is that? 

---

## MARIE: 
It just arrived, and I-I think it's- 

---

## MARIANNE: 
No- 

---

## MARIE: 
I'm so sorry- 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Oh god.

## MARIE: 
I'm so sorry, my friend, 
I'm so sorry. I'm so so sorry.

## MARIANNE: 
Oh god, oh god, oh god. 
Oh god, oh god, oh god. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
We worked so hard. 

---


And fought so hard. 

---


But right now. In this moment. 

---

I really don't know what I'd say if you asked me 

if I'd rather have the cause or have him here. 

---


In this moment? 

---


I might just toss all the revolutions 
for one more...anything. 

---


Stride. 

---

## MARIE: 
Stand.

---

## MARIANNE:
Laugh. 

---

## MARIE: 
Spoon. Yes. But. There is more to do, much more. 

---


Who will give your daughter her present 
if not her fearless, unbreakable mother? 

---

## MARIANNE: 
"Teacup bows are the best. 
Love, Marie" 

---

## MARIE: 
They really are. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Thank you. 

---

## MARIE: 
You're very welcome. 

---


And it will never be truly all right 
after losing him, 

---


but I'm going to say that it will 
because it's really nice to hear it sometimes. 

---


So. "It'll be all right. It'll be all right? 

---

## MARIANNE: 
I never... I never... sent my last letter. 

He never read it. He'll never- 

---

## MARIE: 
Read it now. To me. 

---


I'll hear it for him. 

---


What did you want to say? 

---

## MARIANNE: 
I love you... 
I love you... 
I love you...

[Knock. Knock. Knock.]

## MARIE: 
Here we go. 

---

## MARIANNE:
No, not yet, don't leave, not yet. 

---

## MARIE: 
I wish "yet" would listen. 

---


But if we're honest 
we all knew this was coming. 

---


What should I... 

---


Should I take a book? Or my play? 
I'll give him your letter. 

---


And don't be sad for us. 

---


When you laugh? We will too. 

---

[The door creaks open]

---

## MARIANNE: 
It'll be all right. 

---

## MARIE: 
I think so. 

---

<!-- BLACKOUT SLIDE -->

---

## OLYMPE:
Are they gone? Did they take her? 
Did they take anything of mine? Did they take the- 

---

## MARIANNE: 
I cannot talk to you right now. 

---

## OLYMPE:
But she's gone though right? 

She's gone? She's—? 

---


Oh god, where's my play? 

---


The new play? Did she take it? 
Nonono, not that play. Not that play. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
How could you leave her, 
leave us all? 

---

## OLYMPE:
I will be with you in one minute 
but I think that Marie-Antoinette 
took my goddamn play. 

---


Which means they have it now, 
which means...

---


suddenly I wish I'd written 
a romantic comedy. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
No one cares about your stupid play. 

---


Fiction doesn't matter 
if you're only using it to hide from reality-- 

---


our reality--this reality, 
the one where your friends need you 

---


and are dying alone 
and you're trying to get your lines right.

---

## OLYMPE:
My... No. I'm trying to save our lives. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
There's nothing to save 
if you don't stand for anything. 

---

## OLYMPE:
No, there's nothing to save if they kill us because 

they find my script in Marie-Antoinette's pocket. 

---


Now. Burn the pages. 

---

All my scripts, all the pamphlets. 

---

Anything left. We burn them, 

drown them, eat them, 

just get rid of them. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
No. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Yes. We have to. 

And we leave tonight. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
No. 

No more of this running and dodging. 

---

## OLYMPE:
If I don't, if they find any trace of my writing
about any of us, they come for me, 

---

so start burning shit. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
And if you destroy them 
you destroy Charlotte and Marie and me. 

---


You destroy me. 

---


Because no one writes me down. 

---


But I thought you were. 

---


Sisterhood of heroes. Bullshit. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Hey. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
NO. If you burn this story 
then everything we've fought for, 

---


everything that's happened, 

---


every single person 
that has thrown their life into this 

---


will be as blank and mute 
as the paper you can't seem to fill. 

---

## OLYMPE:
You seem upset. I get that, 

but I'm just saying what we know is true: 

---


This fight isn't winnable any more. 

It's unstoppable this violence and- 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Isn't winnable? 

---

## OLYMPE:
It's not. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
It is. 

---

## OLYMPE:
It's not. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
My husband died for this 

and you tell me that "this isn't winnable"? 

---

## OLYMPE:
Wait-what? 

---

## MARIANNE: 
It's just a game and he lost? 

---

NO. No- 

---

## OLYMPE:
Marianne, wait- 

---

## MARIANNE: 
It can be won, and it will be won, 

---

because people like him died for something real, unlike you and your goddamn stories 

---


that you abandon just when it's 
your time to stand for something. 

---

## OLYMPE:
I didn't-I'm sorry- 

---

## MARIANNE: 
They killed him like he was theirs to throw away 
as they pleased, 

---


but he was mine. He was mine first.

---

## OLYMPE:
Oh Marianne I'm- 

---

## MARIANNE: 
THIS IS NOT YOUR LINE. 

---

## OLYMPE:
I'm sorry, I'm saying I'm sorry. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
You're always saying, saying, saying, 

and you never listen. 

---


Because this is all about you. 

---


Because you cannot feel anything
unless it's staged. 

---


Well I'm gonna blow your mind here 
and tell you that this might not be 
your story in the end. 

---


Yes- Holy shit, the lady who has the time 
to sit down and write her little skits 

---


might not be the hero of 

the French Fucking Revolution. 

---

## OLYMPE:
You came to me, 

you all came to me, and asked for my help- 

---

## MARIANNE: 
And you are failing us 
because you're not writing what's real. 

---


The real world, 
the world you say you want to change, 
is too much to bear and you run. 

---


You run. 

---


You are allowed the privilege of 
telling stories, of naming yourself 
but here you tremble, 

---


afraid of your own power. 

---


Maybe that's why your writing 
doesn't mean anything. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Doesn't mean anything?--

I went to the National Assembly myself and- 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Told them what you thought they could handle. 

---


It didn't work. 

---


Now you're cowering in the shadows, 
abandoning your friends. 

---


Where is my pamphlet, 
my declaration, huh? 

---


You wrote half a play for Marie-Antoinette 
because she's easy to stage. 

---


Where are my words, Olympe? 

---


Or am I one of those breathless puppets 
to which you so often resort. 

---

## OLYMPE:
You can't berate me and call me false 
and then beg me to help you. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
I'm not begging for anything from you. 

I don't need you. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Finally! 

---


I've been waiting for you to declare your damn self 
and stop waiting for me. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
And I'm waiting for you to realize that you can't write the world if you're not in it! 

---


You can't change it if you can't see it! 

---


And you can't be a hero 
if you're too scared to show up. 

---


Or is this all just another drama you'll never finish? 

---

## OLYMPE:
At least I'm trying to create something. 

You're just watching. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Witnessing isn't just watching. 

---

## OLYMPE:
And fear isn't weakness. 

---


Fear is how you know you're paying attention. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Maybe real revolution doesn't have time 
for either fiction or fear. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Because you don't think art matters. 

---


You never did— you never did.

---

## MARIANNE: 
Oh please - I have always stood by you. 

---

## OLYMPE:
You have always judged what I do, 

---


and doubted it, and mocked it 
and truly, in your honest heart, 

---


thought that words don't work. 

---


You would rather have twenty Charlottes 
in this fight than one sane artist 
because theatre seems to piss you off,

---


but death doesn't bother you. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
If your story is so easy to burn 
you won't need my help. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Perhaps a...new friend enters? 

---


Or an old one?

The Trial of Marie-Antoinette.

This is big. The world is watching.

Even so the prosecutor knows that this 
is not a trial but a roast as he says: 

---

## Fraternite 1: 
"Prisoner 280, STATE YOUR DEFENSE." 

---

## MARIE: 
Well. I didn't do...it? 

---

## Fraternite 1: 
"The Tribunal accuses the former and immoral Austrian queen of crimes against humanity, 

---

morality, and the Republic. 
These crimes include: Being queen- 

---

## MARIE: 
Oh, I did do that. 

---

## Fraternite 1: 
"Calling the former king a coward-" 

---

## MARIE: 
Definitely did that. 

---

## Fraternite 1: 
"Conspiring with the enemies of France 
to promote war and destroy the populace--" 

---

## MARIE: 
I did not do that-- 

---

## Fraternite 1: 
"Orchestrating orgies at the palace-" 

---

## MARIE: 
No one told me about that. 

---

## Fraternite 1: 
"She sent French treasury money 
to her true homeland of Austria, 


---

designed the massacre of Swiss Guards, and-" 

---

## MARIE: 
Well this is not hilarious. 

---

## Fraternite 1: 
"And we're not done yet, folks. This woman is also accused of incestuous relations with her own son." 

---

## MARIE: 
NOW YOU LISTEN HERE. YOU MAY PUSH ME 
BUT DO NOT PUSH MY CHILDREN

---


NEVER MY CHILDREN, 

---


YOU DO NOT. SLANDER. CHILDREN. 

---


That accusation is a disgusting lie 
that you dreamt up, not me, 

---

which says a lot more about the dreamer 

than it does the accused you sick,

And the women in the room 
were taken with her passion, 

---


for how many of them had been accused
of being bad mothers by strangers.

You think you're making things 
better with this charade? 

---


But you're not, you're setting us all up for a-

---


All I'm gonna say is watch out for ambitious little emperors whose names rhyme with Shapoleon. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
The prosecutor knew he risked losing the crowd 
so he got right to the point: 

---

## Fraternite 1: 
"The Tribunal has reached a decision." 

---

## MARIE: 
YOU CAME IN HERE WITH A DECISION.

---

## Fraternite 1: 
"Prisoner 280, Marie-Antoinette, 

---


otherwise known as 
the Former Queen of France and Navarre, 

---


otherwise known as 
the Bitch, Madame Deficit, the Widow Capet, 

---


and the Soon-To-Be-No-More. 

---


You are condemned 
and sentenced to die by the guillotine.

---


Now." 

---

## MARIE: 
Then you, sirs, 
bear not the marks of men, 
but the instincts of animals. 

---


And with your mouth of hate 
and hands of hair, 

---


you rip not your enemies in half but your country, 
your country is gored on your watch--

---


so you, Followers of Animal Order, 
will remove the squint from your eyes 

---

so that you may fully see with 
whom you are dealing.

And...I'm sorry too. 

---


And you'll be happy to know that you were right. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Oh. About what? 

---

## MARIANNE: 
I am better at this than you. 

---


I wrote my own pamphlet, which was so good 
it became a declaration. 

---



"We, the free and proud women 
and men of Saint-Domingue, 

---


deny the unjust power of France 
and her agents of torture and greed. 

---


The sun of this island shines on an independent nation of liberty, not property."

 

---

## OLYMPE:
Not. Bad. Citizen. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Oh ya know. Writing what I want. 

---

## OLYMPE:
What we want... 

---

## MARIANNE: 
You know what I really want? 

---


I want people to live their lives 
and make babies and eat too much 
and do experimental theatre. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Now there's a France I can believe in. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
And let's be kind, shall we. 

---


In honor of Vincent, and Charlotte, 
and crazy ass Marie-Antoinette, 

---


let us laugh too loudly and too often, 

---


and call out the hypocrites of our age 
until they are the butt of the joke. 

---


That's what we give our children. 

---


A good laugh. 

---

## OLYMPE:
My son. 

---


All grown up with a son of his own. 

---


What will he think of me? 

---

## MARIANNE: 
He'll think his mom doesn't take 
any shit from anyone, 

---


says what she believes, 

---


and is willing to die for it. 

---

## OLYMPE:
But-yes-but 
I don't particularly want to die for this. 

---


I would rather live for it. 

---

## MARIANNE:
Uh. Yeah. 

---


I think the real win is changing the world 
and living to enjoy it. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Right? 

---


This stuff is scary as hell. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
This is the "Reign of Terror" 
not the "Reign of Agree to Disagree." 

---

## OLYMPE:
OK, I was trying to be brave because you were, 

---


but goddammit I want to outlive these fuckers. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Me too! 

---

## OLYMPE:
Let's just skip to the part 
when we're all over this bullshit 

---


and we can tell our grandchildren 
how we beat these idiots. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Beat them black and goddamn blue. 

---

## OLYMPE:
With our drama! 

---

## MARIANNE:
And our sashes! 

---

## OLYMPE:
And our fists goddammit 
I want to punch those assholes in their eye sockets! 

---


You want a revolution? 

---


COME AT ME. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
COME AT ME TOO. 

---

## OLYMPE:
OK, come at her first and then me. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
OK. One of us has to survive this. 

---


Whoever does will have a lot of work to do. 

---


And three really chatty ghosts 
making sure they do it. 

---

## OLYMPE:
I think it'll be you. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
I think it'll be you. 

---


Either way. We're the heroes. 

---


If you're writing the story. 

---

## OLYMPE:
I should probably hurry up then. 

---

[Knock. Knock. Knock]

---

The Trial of... Me. 

---

[Three hits of a gavel]

---

<!-- BLACKOUT SLIDE -->

---

[Murmurs of the Crowd]

---

## Fraternite 1: 
BY THE AUTHORITY OF 
THE COMMITTEE FOR PUBLIC SAFETY, 

---


YOU ARE HEREBY TRIED WITH TREASON 
FOR CONSISTENT AND AGGRESSIVE 
THEATRICAL ACTIONS. 

---

## OLYMPE:
OK. So. The thing about that is... Yes. 

---


Yes. If being a traitor is loving my country 
enough to shame it for being less 
than its best self, 

---


then I am one, 

---


yes I am, and god knows I don't do 
anything less than aggressive theatre. 

---

## Fraternite 1: 
Your play is a treasonous tract, 

---

## Fraternite 1 & 2: 
a shameful drama, poorly penned- 

---

## OLYMPE:
First draft, Jesus. 

---

## Fraternite 1: 
maliciously and purposefully composed 
to attack the sovereignty of the people. 

---

## OLYMPE:
I would never attack the sovereignty-- 

---

## Fraternite 2: 
Your play depicts the former queen, 
does it not? 

---

## OLYMPE:
Well yes but not in a fine light.

---

## Fraternite 1: 
You portray that woman as a sympathetic figure 
for all to see. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Nonono, the whole point is 
that the queen learns a lesson. 

---


A lesson about the true north 
the Republic. 

---

## Fraternite 2: 
And she learns this lesson 
in your play? 

---

## OLYMPE:
Yes. 

---

## Fraternite 2: 
So she's capable of learning? 

---

## OLYMPE:
Yes. 

---

## Fraternite 1: 
Which makes her a sympathetic figure.
 

---

## OLYMPE:
It just makes her human. 

---

I'm the sympathetic figure in the play. 

---


And I'm the one that convinces her 
that democracy is better than royalty. 

---


That character is Olympe de Gouges
SO AS NOT TO BE CONFUSED 
WITH ANYONE ELSE BUT ME. 

---


This play proves I'm a patriot. 

---


And anyway, 
I haven't even gotten to the end of it. 

---

## Fraternite 2: 
What happens at the end? 

---

## OLYMPE:
Uh..... we'll probably...

---


hear the people sing? 

---


And the sound of distant drums? 

---

## Fraternite 2: 
It's a musical? 

---

## OLYMPE:
For the whole family. 

---


You'll laugh, you'll cry, 
there's a barricade. 

---

## Fraternite 1: 
By unanimous decision, 
this Tribunal states that 
Olympe de Gouges, 

---


the female playwright- 

---

## OLYMPE:
Just playwright. 

---

## Fraternite 1: 
—is guilty 
and shall be punished by death- 

---

## OLYMPE:
You can't kill me for this, 

---

I work in the theatre, 
it's a nonprofit. 

---

## Fraternite 1 & 2: 
We kill a lot of people, Miss De Gouges. 

---

## OLYMPE:
No. You can't kill me. 

---


I'm pregnant. 

---

## Fraternite 1 & 2: 
The Tribunal does not think you're pregnant. 

---

## OLYMPE:
But I am. Definitely pregnant. 

---

## Fraternite 1 & 2: 
We're pretty sure that you're not. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Gimme a few weeks. 

---

## Fraternite 1: 
The condemned shall be killed 
tomorrow morning and justice 
will hereby be served. 

---

## OLYMPE:
THIS IS NOT JUSTICE. 

---


You say you fight for freedom and equality 
but that means art and ideas 
which is my life's work. 

---


A work in progress you might note. 

---


I mean you can't kill the writers, 
that's Democracy 101. 

---


I AM NOT THE PROBLEM, 
YOU ARE THE PROBLEM. 

---

## Fraternite 1 & 2: 
The Tribunal does not think we're the problem. 

---

[Voices whisper]

---

## OLYMPE:
Goddammit-come on-

---


no-NO-YOU GUYS? 
YOU GUYS ARE FUCKING UP THE REVOLUTION. 

---

[Music]

---


Not like this. No. 

---


No, it's not ending like this. 

---


I'm not ending like this.

---



THIS IS NOT. THE END.

---


 
You don't write what you know, 
you write what you want. OK. 

---


Olympe de Gouges - 
well liked and respected in her field 

---


and all the politicians and revolutionaries 
and theatre critics think she's great, 

---


and she will live a long time, 

---


and eat as many macarons as she can carry, 

---


and she will make it out of this, 

---


and she is just walking home from rehearsal, 

---


and enjoying Paris in the fall and— 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
You know that's not as good a story. 

---

## OLYMPE:
I don't care if it is. 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
Yeah you do. 

I know you do. 

---

## OLYMPE:
No, THIS IS MY LIFE, NOT A PLAY. 

---


A PLAY YOU CAN WALK OUT OF 

---

## MARIE: 
I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to- 

---

## OLYMPE:
Marie - help - ribbons.

---

## MARIE: 
I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to-- 

---

## OLYMPE:
What is she saying? 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
Her last words. 

I think that's all she remembers- 

---

## MARIE: 
I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to— 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
Do you have your last words worked out yet? 

---

## OLYMPE:
NO NO I DON'T. 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
You should think about it, writer. 

---

## OLYMPE:
I am not this kind of writer! 

---

## MARIANNE: 
What kind of writer are you? 

---

## OLYMPE:
The really scared kind. 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
Scared that you didn't matter? 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Or that she's going to be 
more famous than all of us. 

---

## MARIE: 
I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to— 

---

## OLYMPE:
No No NO. I'm scared of...

---

of ending. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Then don't. 

---

Turn the end into a beginning.

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
A play that doesn't end? Oh god. 

---

## OLYMPE:
A play that doesn't end? Oh god! 

---

## MARIANNE: 
You're writing what you want, right? 

---


So defy them with your story. 

---


They can't touch the play in your mind. 

---

## OLYMPE:
The play in my mind? 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Yeah. Play that one. 

---

## OLYMPE:
But. I need real help here, not fiction. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
It might be fiction, but it's not fake. 

---


The beating hearts in front of you are real. 

---


The gathering of people is real. 

---


The time we spend together, 
this time, is real. 

---


The story is real when it starts. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Has it? Started? But it can't write itself. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Oh girl. It already is. 

---


Your story isn't yours now. 

---

## MARIE: 
I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to- 

---

## OLYMPE:
But...whose is it? 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
I think...theirs. 

---

## OLYMPE:
But...who are...who...? 

---

## MARIANNE: 
I don't know. 

---


But they showed up 
and seem to be listening. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Are they armed? 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
I think they're just... interested. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Which is what you wanted, isn't it? 

---


An audience. 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
A message. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
A story of our own. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Yes. What a thing. 

---


Thank you. 
For listening. 

---


Thank you, 

It's an honor to...stand before you and- 

---

[Solemn drum tattoo]

---

[Cheers]

---

To stand before you and- 

---

[Charlotte and Marie hum 'Our Song']

---

[Wood creaks]

---

This whole time...I've been standing...
before you and- 

---

[Rope creaks as the blade rises]

---


That's not a way to start a comedy. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
I don't know about you, 

---


but when good stories end 

---


I always want to go 
right back to beginning. 

---

## OLYMPE:
The death of Olympe de Gouges. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
A bright fall day,four P.M., light lingering 
on the trees and slanting low on 
the Place de la Révolution. 

---


Olympe de Gouges walks up the wooden steps 
onto the sturdy stage. 

---


Yes, she thinks, a stage.

---

## OLYMPE:
A stage... 

---

## MARIANNE: 
She thinks of Marie-Antoinette, 

---


who was on this very spot only weeks ago. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Marie. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
She thinks of Charlotte Corday-- 

---

## OLYMPE:
Charlotte... 

---

## MARIANNE: 
and the wildness of her hands and heart, 

---

also here not long ago. 

---

## OLYMPE:
All of us. 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
She also thinks of a woman she passed in the

streets a few weeks ago who held her head high 

---

and wore a sash that said "Revolution For All." 

---


To Olympe she looked like the symbol of freedom. 

---

## OLYMPE:
La Marianne. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Who are we, without a story? 

Lost at sea, in search of land... 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
That woman hummed a soft song 
that slipped into Olympe's ear that day. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
We survive the roughness of glory 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
A song sticks. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
By passing the beat of the beat 
of the heart From hand to hand. 

---

## OLYMPE:
A simple song played on and on. 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
And on and on. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Now Olympe never actually met these women, 

but on the scaffold in that moment- 

---

## OLYMPE:
Her moment. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
She writes what she wants: her own story. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Her own story. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
And her story is one of...sisters. 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
Sisters know what you mean 
when you don't have the words. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
So she tells herself a story as she looks out 
on the masses of people. 

---

## OLYMPE:
Yes. She finds herself with an...audience. 
And a monologue. This she can handle. 

---


So she quiets that fiction in her mind. 

---

And she summons up her truest self. 

---


And the time is now. And the stage is set. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
"Does the condemned have any last words." 

---

## OLYMPE:
And she knows that a story 
is more alive than a fact. 

---

A story is what lives. 

---


Olympe de Gouges stands before them. 

---


And she is good. And she is not alone. 

---

And with her last moments, 
she calls out like a queen, 

---


like a righteous girl, 
like a mother of nations, 

---

she calls out: 

"Children of France. Avenge my death.” 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Which wasn't exactly what she meant. 
She really meant: 

---

## OLYMPE:
"Please do my plays after I'm gone." 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Or: 

---

## OLYMPE:
"Don't settle for the story that they're giving you?" 

---

## MARIANNE: 
or maybe she just meant: 

---

## OLYMPE:
"May God Have No Pity, 
You Motherfuckers." 

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
That's my girl. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
But the crowd understood her. 

---

## OLYMPE:
And a downpour of applause rained on Olympe 
like the curtain call she'd always wanted. 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Which surprised the executioner 
so much that he held the blade longer 
than he'd ever done before. 

---

And that pause cracked him right down the center. 

---

And in that crack grew a rustle, 
that turned into a rumble, 

---

that turned into a... 

---

[Marie giggles]

---

## CHARLOTTE: 
The executioner laughed.
Not at her, at himself. 

---

He caught a glimpse of his own hypocrisy. 

---


Which was horribly, terribly funny. 

---

## OLYMPE:
And the vindication of Olympe de Gouges started, 

---

as it should, with a joke. 

---

## CHARLOTTE:
And a song was sung that Olympe could only hear— 

---

## OLYMPE:
That Olympe could hear only— 

---

## MARIANNE: 
Who are we, without a story? 

---

## OLYMPE:
As the blade fell. 

---

[The whoosh of the blade]

---

<!-- BLACKOUT SLIDE -->

---

And a story...begins.

<!-- BLACKOUT SLIDE -->
