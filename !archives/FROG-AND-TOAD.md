## HOUSE MANAGER:
Hello everyone! Welcome to Chicago Children's Theatre.

---

We're so glad you're here for today's performance of A Year with Frog and Toad.

---

Before the show begins, I have a few things to let you know.

---

Today’s show will be ASL interpreted and open captioned.

---

Please take a moment to turn off or silence all cell phones and smart devices.

---

Absolutely no photo or video is allowed during the performance.

---

Again, there is no photo or video of today's performance.

---

During the show, actors will be moving throughout all parts of the stage including the two doorways.

---

It is very important that you stay in your seat for the entire performance to keep you and the actors safe. 

---

In the case of an emergency, please find an usher, who can help you safely exit the theatre.

---

If you are sitting in the front row, please stay seated and keep your feet on the green part of the floor.

---

If you are sitting near either of the platforms in the corners, 

---

please keep your hands and feet in your seat, and do not touch the platform.


---

Please be respectful to the actors onstage by staying focused on the performance,

---

and save side conversations for after the show.

---

However, Chicago Children's Theatre is a "no-shushing" theatre,

---

because the audience's reactions to the play are important!

---

If something onstage is funny, you can laugh.

---

Let's do a practice laugh together!
[laughter]

---

If something onstage is surprising, you can gasp.

---

Let's do a practice gasp together!
[gasps]

---

And at the end of songs and at the end of play, you can clap to compliment the actors.

---

Let's do a practice round of applause together!
[applause]

---

Alright, I think you're ready for the play!

---

Please enjoy A Year with Frog and Toad!

HE IS THE FINEST FRIEND

## FROG:
I'm just curious. Did you happen to get any mail today?

---

class: blue
## TOAD:
No. I did not, Frog! 

---

class: blue
I never get any mail and it makes me unhappy. You know that! 

---

class: blue
So why do you insist on bringing it up all the time?

---

## FROG:
I'm sorry, Toad.

---

class: blue
## TOAD:
That’s alright 

---

## FROG:
I wonder what time it is? 

---

class: blue
## TOAD:
Well, I don't know that either Frog. 

---

class: blue
As I have repeatedly explained to you, my clock is broken. I need to get a new clock.

---

## FROG:
Of course. That slipped my mind. 

---

Well, here we are at the top of the hill. Look at that view.

---

class: blue
## TOAD:
The snow is lovely. But it’s an awfully long way down. 

---

## FROG:
It will be easy on my sled.

---

class: blue
## TOAD:
Oh, I don't know Frog. I don't think you should go. It looks scary.

---

## FROG:
Don't be silly, Toad. It's not as if I'll be riding all alone.

---

class: blue
## TOAD:
Oh, someone is going with you?

---

## FROG:
Yes, of course.

---

class: blue
## TOAD:
Oh, well that makes all the difference. 

---

## FROG:
Yes, it does. 

---

class: blue
## TOAD:
Who’s going with you? 

---

## FROG:
You are. 

---

class: blue
## TOAD:
Oh. No, Frog!!

---

## FROG:
Don’t be nervous, Toad. I’ll be behind you the whole time. It’s pleasant sledding down the hill.

---

class: blue
## TOAD:
It’s more pleasant sitting in a warm house eating soup. 

---

## FROG:
We can do that once we reach the bottom. Come on. Take a risk. 

---

class: blue
## TOAD:
Oh, very well Frog. Ill go through with it. 

---

## FROG:
That’s fine. You’ll see. It’s pleasant sledding down the hill.

---

class: blue
[upbeat piano music]

Here we go.

## FROG,TOAD:

---

class: blue
## TOAD:

## FROG:

THERE'S A BUMP UP AHEAD THERE

DOWN THE HILL-

[Frog screams]

class: blue
## TOAD:

class: blue
Froooooog!!!

## MOLE 1:
Frog what are you doing here?

---

## FROG:
Hello, Moles. I was thrown from the sled. And now Toad is going down the hill alone.

---


## MOLE 1:
He'll be fine as long as he doesn't take the path on the left.

---


Which path did he take?

---

## MOLE 2:
The path on the left.

---

class: blue
## MOLES:

## FROG:
Wonderful!


---

class: blue
## TOAD:
And angry!


---

## FROG:
Why? 


---

class: blue
## TOAD:
Frog, you left me alone. 


---

## FROG:
I couldn’t help it, Toad. 


---

class: blue
## TOAD:
Oh, yes you could have. You could have not suggested that we go sledding in the first place 

---

class: blue
and exposing us to such a terrible risk.

---

## FROG:
Now, Toad...

---

class: blue
## TOAD:
Oh don’t "now, Toad" me, Frog. I was in absolute peril. 


---

## FROG:
Well I am sorry Toad. 

---

Where are you going? 

---

class: blue
## TOAD:
I’m going home to a warm bowl of soup. 

---

class: blue
And I will never speak with you again.

## FROG:
But Toad…

## TOAD:
You have?

## SNAIL:
Yes. 

---


## TOAD:
Thank you, Snail. 

---


## SNAIL:
You’re welcome. Well, I gotta run. 

---

[plodding music]

---

class: blue
## TOAD:
[clears throat] 
"Dear Toad. 

---

class: blue
Today when you told me that you were sad because you had never received a letter,

---

class: blue
it made me sad too. 

---

class: blue
I suppose that is how it is with you and me. 

---

class: blue
I am writing this letter, hoping that it will make you feel happy, 

---

class: blue
knowing all along that unless you are happy I cannot be. 

---

class: blue
Your friend Frog."

[melancholy music]

class: blue
Frog?

## FROG:
Yes, Toad?

## TOAD:
I am speaking to you again.

Why, yes Toad. That would be very pleasant.

[sentimental music]

[Frog laughs, music ends]

[jazzy piano music]

## SNAIL:
I WAS ALWAYS TIMID
I GUESS IT WAS BECAUSE

---


I MAY HAVE BEEN ASHAMED 
OF WHO I AM OR WHAT I WAS

---


I THOUGHT "I'M JUST A SNAIL
A LOT OF SHELL A LITTLE GOO"

---



BUT ALL OF THAT HAS CHANGED
AS NOW THE FOLLOWING IS TRUE 

---


I GOT SOMETHING I DO 
SOMETHING I'M PROUD OF 

---


BECAUSE I DO IT PRETTY WELL 

---


BING BANG BOOM
GIVE ME SOME ROOM

---


I'M COMING OUT OF MY SHELL 

---


GET OUT THE WORD
FIND ME A WITNESS

---


BLOW ON A TRUMPET 
RING A BELL

---


HOLY SMOKES
LOOK AT ME FOLKS

---


I'M COMING OUT OF MY SHELL

---


THERE WERE SLUGS WHO DOUBTED ME 
I GUESS THAT MADE ME NERVOUS

---


I NEVER EVEN DARED TO DREAM 
OF LIFE IN CIVIL SERVICE

---


THEY SAID I WASN'T FAST ENOUGH 
THEY SAID "HEY YOU'RE TOO GOOEY"

---


BUT THEN I TURNED AROUND AND TOLD 'EM 
"PHOOEY! THAT'S ALL HOOEY"

---


I WAS NOTHING BUT GOO UNDER THE SURFACE

---


THEN EVERYTHING BEGAN TO GEL 

---


HOLY COW
LOOK AT ME NOW

---


I'M COMING OUT OF MY- 
YES I DELIVER

---


I'M COMING OUT OF MY- 
I'M GOING POSTAL

---

## TOAD:
It's Christmas Eve. The fire is burning. The hot chocolate is ready. But Frog is late. 

---

class: blue
At least I think he is late. But, he must be late. 

---

class: blue
It has been dark for a very long time. Maybe something has happened to him. 

---

class: blue
Maybe something bad. Maybe something terrible. 

---

class: blue
Maybe he is lost in the dark and he cannot find his way and he is cold and shivering.

---

class: blue
Or maybe, he is stuck at the bottom of a hole and he cannot get out and he is cold and shivering. 

---

class: blue
Or maybe, he is being chased by a wolf and he's running as fast as he can and well,

---

class: blue
he wouldn't be cold and shivering, because when you run it warms you up...

---

class: blue
but that is not the point! 

---

class: blue
The point is that Frog may be in terrible danger. 

---

class: blue
I must do something. I must help my friend. I must get a lamp and a rope... 

---

class: blue
and a frying pan!

---

class: blue
Frog! Frog! Don't worry, I'll save you! I am prepared for any situation.

I HAVE A LIGHT

SO YOU WON'T BUMP YOUR
HEAD ON THE TREES

OR IF YOU ARE... DEEP IN A HOLE
YOU ARE STUCK IN A HOLE

AND NO ONE CAN HEAR
AS YOU SHOUT

I'LL BRING A ROPE
A THICK PIECE OF ROPE

## TOAD:
Oh. For me? 


---

## FROG:
Yes. 

---

class: blue
## TOAD:
I can open it? 

---

## FROG:
Of course!

---

class: blue
## TOAD:
It’s a clock! 

---

## FROG:
Yes and it keeps very good time. 


---

class: blue
## TOAD:
I needed a clock. 

---

## FROG:
I know you did Toad. 

---

class: blue
## TOAD:
Your present isn’t here yet. 


---

## FROG:
That’s all right Toad. 


---

class: blue
## TOAD:
It was supposed to be delivered this afternoon. 

---

## FROG:
It’s being delivered? 


---

class: blue
## TOAD:
Yes. 


---

## FROG:
By whom? 


---

class: blue
## TOAD:
Snail. He should be here any minute. 


---

## FROG:
Maybe we should sit down.


---

class: blue
## TOAD:
I'll put the clock on the mantle. This is lovely wrapping paper, Frog.

---

## FROG:
Thank you Toad. This is a very nice fire.


---

class: blue
## TOAD:
It's warm.


---

## FROG:
This is a very peaceful Christmas Eve.


---

class: blue
## TOAD:
It didn't start out that way.

## FROG:
I'm sorry I was late.

class: blue
## TOAD:
I was very worried you know.

## FROG:
I know you were.

class: blue
## TOAD:
I was very worried...

HE'S NOT SO GOOD AT SPORTS

BUT TOAD HAS BEEN A LOVELY FRIEND TO ME 
Let me tell you about Toad...

---


TOAD, I FEEL, IS VASTLY UNDERRATED

HE IS THE FINEST FRIEND

## FROG:
Funny, you have been in all of my dreams too.

I had one not so pleasant dream, where we went swimming.

---

## FROG:
Really? So did I. And I had a dream that you made the most wonderful cookies.

---

class: blue
## TOAD:
Really? So did I! And I dreamed that we went down a hill on a sled.

## FROG:
Really? So did I!

---

class: blue
## TOAD:
This is uncanny.


---

## FROG:
Remarkable. Well, I'm getting ready to wake up, so you better get back to your own
