## THESEUS:
Think no longer that you are in command here,

---

But, rather, think how when you were
You served your own destruction.

---

Welcome, brothers and sisters.
I take as my text this evening the Book of Oedipus.

---

Oedipus! Dammed in his birth, in his marriage damned,
Dammed by the blood he shed with his own hand!

---

Oedipus! A man so pitifully ensnared in the net of his own life’s destiny…

---

Net of incest, mingling wives, sisters, mothers, with fathers, sons, brothers.

---

You have all heard of the death of Jocasta. Jocasta.

---

Whose husband was by her husband, whose children were by her child.

---

You have heard how the wretched Oedipus found her body swaying from the cruel cord she had noosed about her neck.

---

How a great sob broke from him, heartbreaking to hear, as he loosed the rope and lowered her body to the ground.

---

I would blot out from my mind what happened next! For they say this King ripped from her gown the golden brooches that were her ornaments, 

---

and raised them on high, and plunged them down
straight into his own eyeballs, crying, 

---

“No more, no more shall you look on the misery about me, the horrors of my own doing!” 

---

“Too long you have known the faces of those whom I never should have seen, too long been blind to those for whom I was searching!”

---

“From this hour, go in darkness!”

---

And as he spoke, he struck at his eyes—
Not once, but many times; they say the blood burst from his ruined sockets like red hail.

---

Net of blood! His father’s blood, his own blood, shed by his own hand.

---

In Exodus where it speaks of his death in a place called Colonus… which was sacred... And his redemption there…

---

We direct you to lines 275 through 279, wherein he cries out to his daughters: 

---

“I could say much to you if you could understand me. But as it is, I have only this prayer for you:

---

Live where you can. Be as happy as you can –
Happier, please God, than God has made your father.” Amen.

---

Let every man consider his last day<br>
When youthful pleasures have faded away<br>
Can he look at his life without pain?

---

Let every child remember how to pray<br>
For the lost of the Earth to find the way<br>
And the Kingdom of Heaven reign.

## EVANGELIST:
(speaking over the music) Men and Women of Thebes: look upon Oedipus.

---

This is the king who solved the famous riddle and towered up, most powerful of men.

---

No mortal eyes but looked on him with envy, yet in the end ruin swept over him.

---

Let every man in mankind’s frailty consider his last day; 

---

and let none presume on his good fortune until he find life, at his death, a memory without pain. Amen.

## SOLOISTS:
So don’t go…

## OEDIPUS:
Daughter! Sister!

---

[organ music under] 

## THESEUS:
Alas for the seed of men.

---

What measure shall we give these generations that breath on the void and are void and exist and do not exist?

---

Majestic Oedipus! O naked brow of wrath and tears, O change of Oedipus!

---

I who saw your days call no man blest — your great days — like ghosts are gone.

---

True King, giver of laws, majestic Oedipus!

---

No prince in Thebes had ever known such renown
No prince won such grace of power.

---

And now of all men ever known most pitiful is this man’s story: His fortunes are most changed, his state Fallen.

---

All eyes fail before time’s eye, all actions come to justice there.

---

Though never willed, though far down the deep past, your bed, your dread sirings, are brought to book at last.

---

Child by Laius doomed to die, then doomed to lose that fortunate little death —

---

Would God you never took breath in this air that with my wailing lips I take to cry: for I weep the world’s outcast.

---

I was blind! And now I can tell why: Asleep! For he had given ease of breath to Thebes, while the false years went by.

---

## OEDIPUS:
Daughter!

---

## THESEUS:
He speaks, saying: “Daughter! Daughter of a blind old man…”

---

## OEDIPUS:
Where have we come to…

---

## THESEUS:
“Where have we come to now, Antigone?”

---

## OEDIPUS:
Who will be kind to me?

---

## THESEUS:
Who will be kind to Oedipus this evening? And give alms…

---

## OEDIPUS:
Who will give alms?

## THESEUS:
“Who will give alms to the wanderer?”
Though he ask little and receive still less!

---

## OEDIPUS:
That’s all right.

## THESEUS:
It is sufficient.

---

## THESEUS:
“Suffering and time,” he says, suffering and time, vast time, have been his teachers in contentment. “But now, child…”

---

## OEDIPUS:
Now, child. If you can find a resting place…

## THESEUS:
“Child. If you can find a resting place…”

---

## ANTIGONE:
I see a man now, not far away. Father you must ask what place this is.

---

## OEDIPUS:
Friend…

## THESEUS:
“Friend, my daughter’s eyes serve for my own.”

---

## THESEUS:
“She tells me we are fortunate enough to meet you.”

---

## OEDIPUS:
Can you tell me, what ground is this? What God is honored here?

---

## THESEUS:
“What ground is this? What God is honored here?”

---

## THE FRIEND:
It must not be touched. Most dreadful are its divinities, most feared, daughters of darkness. Spirits. Furies.

---

The people here prefer to address them as Gentle All-Seeing ones.

---

## OEDIPUS:
Then may they be gentle to the suppliant. For I shall never leave this resting place.

## OEDIPUS:
And who is he whose word has power here?

---

## THE FRIEND:
This land is governed by King Theseus

---

## OEDIPUS:
Tell him a small favor will gain him much.

---

## THE FRIEND:
What service can a blind man render him?

---

## OEDIPUS:
All I shall say will be clear-sighted indeed.

---

It was ordained. I recognize it now. I shall never leave this resting place.

Daughter, lead me on. Lead me on.

You oughta speak. Speak right now! Speak now! Speak!

I’ve been waiting for a sign<br>
To ease my troubled mind<br>
(vamping) Oooh

---

## EVANGELIST:
(over the music) Why have you come, child? What news from Thebes did you bring your father? Where are your brothers?

---

## EVANGELIST and ISMENE:
She tells of his sons Polyneices and Eteocles. First it was their desire that the throne should pass to Lord Creon; 

---

that thus the city of Thebes should be defiled no longer by their/our family’s ancient curse. 

---

But then the sons began to itch for power, how they fought till Eteocles, the younger son, threw the elder out, and took the throne. 

---

How Polyneices then went to Argos, committed treason for an army; sold out his city of Thebes for the promise of his father’s throne.

---

How he marches on Thebes now. Brother, the traitor, marches on brother, the usurper now, and, trembling at his coming, Thebes calls for you.

---

## OEDIPUS:
For me?

---

## EVANGELIST and ISMENE:
Thebes call for you to be a shield against your son. The oracles declare their strength in you. 

---

The proof of it is that Creon is coming for you for that same reason.

---

## OEDIPUS:
Will my soul rest satisfied? Will Thebes bury me in Theban ground?

---

## ANTIGONE:
Ah, Father!

---

## EVANGELIST:
No, your father’s blood forbids it.

---

## OEDIPUS:
They will never hold me! Gods! May their fires of ambition never be quenched. Let the last word be mine on this battle.

---

Let them that would be the kings of Thebes before sons of Oedipus — Let them kill each other!

---

Well, I’m crying tears of sadness<br>
Father, won’t you turn them into tears of gladness?

---

## CHORUS:
Through my tears, through my tears<br>
Tears…<br>
Tears…<br>
Tears…

---

## EVANGELIST:
It will be bitter for them when they stand where you are buried and feel your anger there.

---

## OEDIPUS:
So let Creon be sent to find me. Creon or any other of influence in the state. 

---

If you here consent – as do the powers holy and awful, the spirits of this place — to give me refuge. 

---

Then shall Colonus have a great savior; and woe to mine enemies.

---

## ANTIGONE:
But for now, Father, pray to the Gods whose ground you violated here. Ask their forgiveness.

---

## OEDIPUS:
What shall I do?

---

## ANTIGONE:
You must first bring libations from the spring that runs forever.

---

## OEDIPUS:
And when I have the holy water?

---

## ANTIGONE:
Take this bowl. Put chaplets round the rim.

---

## OEDIPUS:
Of myrtle springs, or wool?

---

## ANTIGONE:
Of fleece cropped from a young lamb.

---

## OEDIPUS:
How shall I perform this rite?

---

## ANTIGONE:
You must face the quarter of the morning light and pour out your libation.

---

## OEDIPUS:
From this bowl?

---

## ANTIGONE:
In one clear stream. Empty and fill it again with water and honey. But without wine.

---

## OEDIPUS:
And when this earth receives it?

---

## ANTIGONE:
Cover the place with olive… And then pray, Father, saying:

---

“Daughters. Spirits. Be gentle of heart. Accept with gentleness the suppliant and his wish.”

---

## OEDIPUS (CHORUS responding):
“Daughters. Spirits. Be gentle of heart. Accept with gentleness the suppliant and his wish.”

[music stops]

---

## CHORAGOS:
What evil things have slept since long ago?

---

## OEDIPUS:
Do not open my old wound and my shame.

---

## CHORAGOS:
It is told everywhere and never dies.

---

## OEDIPUS:
Thebes married me to evil, fate and I were joined there.

---

## CHORAGOS:
It was your mother with whom the thing was done?

---

## OEDIPUS:
Yes: and those two girls of mine were given birth by her who gave birth to me.

---

## CHORAGOS:
Then they are your daughters; they are also…

---

## OEDIPUS:
Sisters. Yes… their father’s sisters.

You killed him!

---

## OEDIPUS and THESEUS:
“No! I shall not be judged so. In me, myself, you could not find such evi as would have made me sin against my own. 

---

Perhaps our ancestors angered God long ago.” 

---

He said, “If there were prophecies repeated by the oracles of the gods that the father’s death would come from his own son...

---

... how could you justly blame it upon me? On me, who was yet unborn, yet unconceived? He wished to murder me, I did not know him.

---

Before the law – before God – I am innocent.”

---

## THESEUS:
Antigone pleads with the people of Colonus.

---

## ANTIGONE:
Reverent men! Blessed women!

---

Since you will not suffer my father, old man that he is, take pity on me and let me intercede.

---

Not with lost eyes, but looking in your eyes as if I were a child of yours, I beg mercy for him, a beaten man! Hear me!

---

We are thrown upon your mercy as on God’s; be kinder than you seem! Gods, I pray you! Be compassionate!

---

For you will never see in all the world a man whom God has let escape his destiny!

O Lord, hear my prayer

---

## OEDIPUS:
(over the music) Ladies whose eyes are terrible: Spirits: upon your sacred ground I have first bent my knees in this new land; 

---

therefore, you be mindful of me and of Apollo, for when he gave me oracles of evil, he also spoke of this: a resting place,

---

That after long years in the last country, where I should find a home among the powers of justice: that I might round out there my bitter life.

---

Conferring benefits on those who received me, and a curse on those who have driven me away.

---

Portents, he said, would make me sure of this: earthquakes, thunder, or God’s smiling lightening; 

---

but I am sure of it now, sure that you guided me and led me here into your hallowed wood.

---

How otherwise could I have found this chair of stone?

---

Grant me then, Goddesses, passage from life at last, and consummation, as the unearthly voice foretold; 

---

unless indeed I seem not worthy of your grace — bound as I am to such ending pain as no man had before.

---

O hear my prayer, sweet children of original Darkness hear me, pity a poor man’s carcass and his ghost, for Oedipus is not the strength he was.

---

Therefore, in the name of God, give me shelter! Give me sanctuary! Through my face be dreadful in its look, yet honor me!

---

For I come as one endowed with grace by those who are over Nature; and I bring advantage. I bring advantage.

---

I bring advantage to this place.

Father, Theseus has come.

## THESEUS:
In the old time I often heard men tell of the bloody extinction of his eyes. 

---

Even if on my way I were not informed, I’d recognize him, son of Laius. I am sorry for him.

---

I too was an exile. Therefore no wanderer shall come to me, as she has done and be denied.

---

He has asked for grace! And offers no small favor in return. As I value this, I shall not, I cannot, I will not refuse this man’s desire.

Greetings!

Citizens of this land, I bring your greetings! I can see my arrival has been a cause of considerable fear to you.

Don’t be afraid and don’t be hostile! I am an old man; I don’t want hostilities.

## THESEUS:
Four eleven, page 121 in your text – Creon, King of Thebes, comes to Colonus.

## CREON:
I come for this man here. Yes, I am sent to bring him to the land of Thebes.

---

It was ordered by the whole Theban people. I am the emissary because it fell to me as his relative.

---

Poor Oedipus. Come home. Your people summon you. Your people are right to summon you. Come home.

---

I grieve for your unhappiness, old man. I see you ravaged. A stranger everywhere, never at rest, leading a beggar’s life, with only a girl to help you.

---

Does this not shame our people? 

---

In the name of your father’s Gods, bury the whole thing now; agree to go back to your city and your home! Come on back home.

No! No! You’ll not get reprieved! What you’ll get is all my vengeance rampant in that land forever!

And what my sons will get of my old kingdom is just so much room as they need to die in!

Polyneices, eldest son of Oedipus, comes to Colonus.

Fortunate is the man who has never tasted God’s vengeance! Where once the anger of Heaven has struck, that house is shaken forever:

Damnation rises behind each child like a black wave cresting.

Father, shall I weep first for my own misfortunes or for yours?

Father, God himself seats mercy by his throne. So may mercy restrain you now as well. Wrongs, wrongs can still be healed.

Speak to me!

Why are you silent?

They are your brother’s – hands that have brought your father’s once clear eyes to this way of seeing.

Ah my dears, be rooted in your father’s arms, and rest.

## POLYNEICES:
I will speak out then!

[music stops]

---

Father. I will tell you why I came.

---

I am a fugitive, driven from my country because as the eldest son born I thought fit to take my seat upon your sovereign throne.

---

And for this my younger brother banished me. Of this I believe the Furies that pursue him were indeed the cause – 

---

-- or so I hear from clairvoyants whom I afterwards consulted. Then why, why should I come here now?

He’s so slick.

Father! These same oracles... They say that those you bless and only those that you bless… shall come to power.

My prayers and those of all who fight with me must then be made to you. Great captains follow me.

Stand… stand by me<br>
Stand… stand by me<br>
Stand… stand by me

## POLYNEICES:
Now in the name of these brave men and for your own soul’s sake, we your children all implore and beg you to give up your heavy wrath against me! 

---

Listen to me. We are beggars, are we not?

---

Both of us are exiles, he and I. We live by paying court to other men, and the same fate follows us.

---


But as for my brother, he lords it in our house, luxuriates there, and he laughs, he laughs at both of us, Father.

---

I go forth to punish him who robbed me of my kingdom. If you will stand by me in my resolve,
I’ll waste no time or trouble whipping him.

---

And then I will re-establish you in our house, and settle there myself, and throw him out.

If your will is the same as mine, it is possible to promise this.

If not, I will die.

Weeping is no good now! For we have placed a curse on you that we now invoke!

You shall never see your native land again. You shall never see your native land again.

You will go down all bloody and your brother too. Yes, you shall die by your own brother’s hand. And you shall kill the man who banished you.

For this I pray and cry out to the hated underworld that it may take you home.

What heavy burden will he not endure?

## OEDIPUS:

Jealousy, faction, quarrelling, and battle, the bloodiness of war, the grief of war.

Jealousy, faction, quarrelling, and battle, the bloodiness of war, the grief of war.

You know, I think some shore in the north concussive waves make stream this way and that in the gales of winter.

It is like that with me sometimes – The wild wrack breaking over me, all the way from my head to my foot, and coming on forever.

This is God’s work! My lord, I longed for you to come. My soul sinks in the scale.

I believe you. I have seen you prophecy many a thing, none falsely.

## OEDIPUS:
I would not die without fulfilling what I promised.

---

I shall disclose to you what is appointed for you and your city. A thing that age will never wear away.

For every nation that lives peaceably, another will grow hard and push it’s arrogance, put off God and turn into madness.

Fear not. God attends to these things slowly; but he attends. You know this; you know all that I teach.

That is the thing that seems so marvelous. You know, for you were witnesses, how he left this place with no friend leading him,

---

Acting, himself, as a guide for all of us.

---

Well, when he came to a steep place in the road, the embankment there, secured with steps of brass,

---

He stopped in one of the many branching paths. 

---

Halfway between that place of stone, with its hollow pear tree, and the marble tomb, he sat down and undid his filthy garments.

---

Then he called to his daughters and commanded that they should bring him water from a fountain for bathing and libation to the dead.

---

From there they could see the hillcrest of Demeter, freshener of all things. 

---

They ascended the hills and soon came back with water for their father; they helped him properly to bathe and dress.

---

When everything was completed to his satisfaction, and no command of his remained undone, the earth groaned with thunder from God below.

---

And as they heard the sound, the children were so afraid, and dropped to their fathers knees, 

---

and began shuttering, beating their breasts, and began to weep as if heartbroken.

---

And hearing them cry out so bitterly, he put his arms around them and said to them:

---

“My Children, my Children, this day your father is gone from you. All that was mine is gone. 

---

You no longer have to bear the burden of taking care of me.

---

I know it was hard, my children, and yet one word, one word frees us of all the pain and burdens of this life;

---

That word is love. Love. Never shall you have more from any man than you have had from me.

---

But now you must spend the rest of your life without me.”

---

They huddled there together, the three of them and wept.

---

And there was silence, and in the silence suddenly a voice cried out to him of such a kind it made our hair stand in panic and fear.

---

Again and again the call came from his God:

---

“Oedipus! Oedipus! Why do you wait? You delay too long; you delay too long to go.”

---

This much everyone of us heard God say. 

---

And after a while as we withdrew, we turned around – and nowhere saw that man. 

---

In what manner Oedipus perished, no one of mortal men could tell. 

---

It was not lightning, bearing its fire, that took him off. Ah, no hurricane was blowing.

---

But some attendant from the train of Heaven came for him; or else the underworld opened up with love the unlit door of the earth.

---

For he was taken without lamentation, suffering, or pain. Yes —

---

He was taken without lamentation, suffering, or pain. 

---

Indeed his end was wonderful if mortal’s ever was.

---

Now let the weeping cease. Let no one mourn again. The love of God will bring you peace. There is no end.
