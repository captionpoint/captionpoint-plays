HOLMES/POIROT
]
.small[
By Jeffrey Hatcher & Steve Hendrickson
]

---

## HOLMES:
“A body with a blade. Any type will do, so long as it’s sharp enough to cut through fabric, flesh and bone.”

---

## HOLMES:
“But where is the blade?”

---

## WATSON:
“Said Sherlock Holmes.
But this was later.”

---

## WATSON:
“It began 36 hours earlier, in the rooms Holmes and I shared at 221b Baker Street.”

---

## HOLMES:
Watson, you’ve fallen in love.

---

## WATSON:
Holmes, wherever have you been?

---

## HOLMES:
At the University of Warsaw dealing with a little matter for brother Mycroft. 

---

The Diogenes Club had taken an interest in the mysterious death of Bronski, the celebrated biologist.

---

Do you know the curious thing about poison dart frogs?

---

## WATSON:
No, but doubtless you’re about to tell me.

---

## HOLMES:
A dart frog’s toxicity is advertised by its bright color. 

---

A seasoned biologist such as Professor Bronski would never handle a dart frog without protective gloves. 

---

Yet Bronski had lethal quantities of lipophilic alkaloid venom in his bloodstream, 

---

but no gloves were on his hands and no frog in his laboratory displayed the tell-tale colors. 

---

Then I recalled that one of Bronski’s academic rivals was an accomplished geneticist.

---

## WATSON:
Geneti--?

---

## HOLMES:
The science of biological inheritance, in time it will completely revolutionize the field. 

---

Bronski’s rival was able to breed a strain of poison dart frog with no tell-tale coloration: 

---

an innocent-looking green frog, yet lethal to the touch. Bronski picked it up et finis.

---

## WATSON:
Who was Bronski’s rival?

---

## HOLMES:
Mrs. Bronski, naturally. The competition among Polish biologists is noted for its savagery.

---

## WATSON:
Holmes, there are times when your capabilities... Hang on. 

---

When you came in a moment ago, you said something. You said... What did you say?

---

## HOLMES:
I said: “Watson, you’ve fallen in love.”

---

## WATSON:
I thought that’s what you said.

---

## HOLMES:
The woman is married to a husband you don’t like, you’ve met her two times, 

---

corresponded with her six, and you have grave concerns for her safety.

---

## WATSON:
However did you..? Oh, it doesn’t matter how you know, you just do.

---

But you want to tell me, so go on.

---

## HOLMES:
You are holding no less than six pieces of correspondence, 

---

beginning with a thank you card in a woman’s hand, two brief notes, and three letters each longer than the one before.

---

This last one, dated two days ago, is four pages double-sided. 

---

Clearly, this woman has a great deal to confide in you. 

---

The only possible reason is that she’s in trouble and has reached out to you because she knows about your exploits with me. 

---

Oh, and based on the postmarks, the purple stain, and a certain oenological aroma, 

---

suggest that the husband and wife live in France and have something to do with wine.

---

## WATSON:
Wrong! ..about one detail. 

---

She didn’t contact me as a way to contact you. I am, as you know, on call to certain hotels in the West End. 

---

A fortnight ago, I was contacted by the Savoy to treat a gentleman with severe indigestion. 

---

There I found one Arnold Berenger in a most dyspeptic state. 

---

The cause was oysters, according to Lily.

---

## HOLMES:
“Lily”?

---

## WATSON:
Mrs. Berenger. She’s a wonderful woman, but such an anxious personality. 

---

One can see it in her eyes. 

---

Her husband, on the other hand, was in a dyspeptic mood well before he ingested the oysters.

---

## HOLMES:
Why were they in London?

---

## WATSON:
They came for the wine auction at Harrod’s. Arnold is, as you surmised, in the trade, dealing in Bordeaux.

---

Lily invited me to tea with her at Fortnum’s, as a thank-you for treating him, and you’ll never guess what happened.

---

## HOLMES:
The husband, in a fit of jealousy, caused a scene.

---

## WATSON:
Brag and bounce, Holmes, will you let me tell my story? 

---

There was a scene. Lily assured him it was innocent, but he wouldn’t listen. 

---

They returned to Paris that night.

---

## HOLMES:
And this was followed by...?

---

## WATSON:
More correspondence, she apologizing to me for his behavior, me assuring her it was nothing, 

---

she thanking me for being so understanding. 

---

Then, two days ago I received this.

---

## LILY:
“My dear John, Apparently I am a Russian princess! A member of the Romanov family! 

---

Now there are men, also Russian, lurking about my husband’s wine establishment. 

---

John, you spoke many times of your friend Mr. Sherlock Holmes. 

---

If there is anything the both of you can do to help, please, come to Paris. 

---

Come now. Come quickly. Yours ever, Lily.”

---

## HOLMES:
Should I assume this is your way of telling me not to unpack?

---

## WATSON:
I wired Lily that we would join her as soon as you returned from your Polish frog adventure. 

---

Come Holmes, the game is afoot!

---
[ Train Whistle ]

---

## LILY:
There you are! Oh, it’s so good to see you. 

---

## WATSON: 
Mrs. Berenger, may I present Mr. Sherlock Holmes. 

---

## LILY: 
Mr. Holmes.

---

## HOLMES:
Mrs. Berenger.

---

## LILY:
Eloise, tea. 

---

## ELOISE:
Oui, madame.

---

## LILY:
It’s so considerate of you to come.

---

## HOLMES:
Who doesn’t enjoy a sudden and unexpected jaunt to Paris? 

---

## LILY: 
Yes, and now that you’re here, I confess to feeling a bit foolish.

---

## WATSON:
Foolish? Your letter sounded desperate.

---

## LILY:
I know. I may have overreacted to this news about my heritage.

---

## HOLMES:
You mean your claim to being a member of the Russian royal family?

---

## LILY:
I make no claim! I’m an Englishwoman of an English mother and an English father, as I told Fraulein Bundt.

---

## HOLMES:
Who is Fraulein Bundt?

---

## LILY:
The genealogist who made the discovery. Fraulein Bundt attests that my true father was the Grand Duke Pyotr, which means my late mother and he..

---

## WATSON:
Yes, we understand.

---

## ELOISE:
Thé, madame. Also cheese and pâtés'.

---

## LILY:
I’ll pour. The cheese and pate’ are for the gentlemen.

---

## ELOISE:
Oui, madame. Et la couturière arrive pour agrandir vos robes.

---

## LILY:
Dites-lui d’attendre.

---

## HOLMES:
Not having anything to eat?

---

## LILY:
I’ve a little indigestion.

---

## HOLMES:
Do you mind if I smoke?

---

## LILY:
Actually, my late father was a smoker, and the smell of tobacco makes me --

---

## WATSON:
I’m sure it can wait, Holmes. These Russians, who’s seen them?

---

## LILY:
We’ve all caught glimpses of them, but only Monsieur Conneau, my husband’s business partner, got close enough to see and hear them. 

---

He’s certain they spoke Russian.

---

## WATSON:
Sounds as if Fraulein Bundt told the wrong people about your lineage.

---

## LILY:
Mr. Holmes, how do you explain it?

---

## HOLMES:
Russia is rife with plots and counterplots. The last czar was assassinated, the prime minister was killed just months ago. 

---

Anyone revealed to be in the royal line of succession would be vulnerable to kidnapping, ransom, murder by any of the rival revolutionary factions.

---

## LILY:
That is what I feared when I wrote to Dr. Watson.

---

## HOLMES:
Then why do you say now that you overreacted?

---

## LILY:
I sometimes let my natural anxiety get the best of me.

---

## WATSON:
Nonsense! It’s because of Arnold! 

---

He sees money in your connection to the royal family, so he told you to retract what you wrote, didn’t he?

---

## LILY:
My husband is indeed eager to be part of the Russian aristocracy, but he’s blind to the possibility that we could be in danger. 

---

It was foolish of me to think I could keep the truth from you, John.

---

## HOLMES:
Yes, well done, “John.” You've drawn out information I couldn’t possibly have ascertained.

---

## ARNOLD:
Good lord. Watson. Come all the way to Paris to practice more of your medical quackery?

---

## WATSON:
Berenger. Who’s this?

---

## ARNOLD:
Who's this?

---


## LILY:
Allow me to introduce my husband Arnold and his business partner Georges Conneau. This is Mr. Sherlock Holmes.

---

## ARNOLD:
The detective. Come about this Russian nonsense, have you? 

---

Apparently they’ve got us surrounded.

---

## HOLMES:
Monsieur Conneau, I understand you’re the only person who has observed these men close up.

---

## CONNEAU:
Yes, but I couldn’t see the Russians’ faces. They wear black overcoats and bowler hats.

---

## ARNOLD:
Sound like cartoon anarchists.

---

## WATSON:
Berenger, I strongly suggest you take an attitude of seriousness about this.

---

## CONNEAU:
I agree.

---

## ARNOLD:
Oh, do you, Georges? Well, that changes everything. 

---

See what happens when it turns out you’ve married a czarina, Eloise? 

---

All her gentleman friends come to flutter and cluck.

---

## ELOISE:
Monsieur --

---

## ARNOLD:
I don’t have time for this, I’m a businessman! I don’t fret that the vintage ‘78 is a come down. 

---

Or that my wife is looking a bit pale. You’re a pair of old women! What about you, Mr. Holmes? 

---

Have you got a handkerchief stuck up your sleeve? Do you faint at the sight of blood?

---

## HOLMES:
Depends on whose it is.

---

## ARNOLD:
He’s a cool one, isn’t he, Eloise? Got the heartbeat of a cadaver.

---

## WATSON:
Holmes has come here to help you, Berenger.

---

## ARNOLD:
You think I can’t look after my own woman? Everything I do I do for her. 

---

Moving to Paris, this wine business that loses money year after year.

---

## LILY:
Arnold—

---

## ARNOLD:
Shut up.

---

You see this? Bought it just today. Rather expensive. 

---

But one must always have the best of everything.

---

If those Russians show up, I could do some damage with this, don’t you think?

---

## HOLMES:
If they give you time to unsheath it.

---

## ARNOLD:
Oh, I’ll have it out, don’t you worry.

---

## LILY:
Mr. Holmes, what would you suggest we do?

---

## HOLMES:
Check into a good hotel.

---

## ARNOLD:
A good hotel? Who’s paying?

---

## WATSON:
Considering that you may be in severe peril, it’s pennywise pound foolish to stint on your security.

---

## HOLMES:
Quite right. A stay at The Ritz should suffice.

---

## ARNOLD:
The Ritz?!

---

## HOLMES:
The staff there is trustworthy and no one will be able to reach you unannounced or clandestinely.

---

## LILY:
I think we should do as Mr. Holmes and Dr. Watson say.

---

## ARNOLD:
All right, but only for one night.

---

You and I will discuss this further when we’re alone. 

---

That should bring your color back. It always does.

---

## LILY:
What will you do, Mr. Holmes?

---

## HOLMES:
It’s time we acquainted ourselves with the Romanov family tree. 

---

Dr. Watson and I will pay a call on Fraulein Bundt.

---

---

## FRAULEIN BUNDT:
Herr Holmes and Dr. Watson. This is Mademoiselle Raspail, my amanuensis.

---

## MADEMOISELLE RASPAIL:
It is a pleasure to meet.

---

## WATSON:
Enchanté, mademoiselle, fraulein.

---

## HOLMES:
It would seem we were expected.

---

## FRAULEIN BUNDT:
Fortune favors the prepared. Kiki, offer the gentlemen an aperitif.

---

## WATSON:
Bit early in the day, isn’t it?

---

## MADEMOISELLE RASPAIL:

Pah! It is almost noon!

---

## HOLMES:
Ahh. “Study of Olympe Pelissier as Judith.” A splendid reproduction.

---

## FRAULEIN BUNDT:
We are admirers of your great-uncle’s work.

---

## WATSON:
Uncle?

---

## FRAULEIN BUNDT:
Like you, I am in a profession which involves the discovery of interesting backgrounds. 

---

Herr Holmes has a fascinating lineage.

---

## MADEMOISELLE RASPAIL:
The maternal line, in particular, is most interesting.

---

## FRAULEIN BUNDT:
Your grandmother was the sister of Vernet, the French Orientalist painter.

---

I find his skin tones particularly moving.

---

## MADEMOISELLE RASPAIL:
One can feel the heat rising from the canvas.

---

## WATSON:
Yes, I’m starting to feel very warm indeed.

---

## FRAULEIN BUNDT:
There is a family tree behind this, don’t you suspect?

---

## HOLMES:
There may be, but we are here on another matter. Mrs. Berenger. 

---

Am I correct that it was you who sought her out and not the other way around?

---

## FRAULEIN BUNDT:
I was researching another family and happened across the connection. 

---

I felt it my proper duty to inform her.

---

## MADEMOISELLE RASPAIL:
Fraulein Bundt’s clients are always so grateful to hear such ennobling news.

---

## HOLMES:
Lily Berenger has not welcomed your findings.

---

## WATSON:
She’s importuned you to desist, has she not?

---

## MADEMOISELLE RASPAIL:
Desist, cease, stop! La femme est folle!

---

## FRAULEIN BUNDT:

Kiki.

---

## MADEMOISELLE RASPAIL:
Pardon.

---


## FRAULEIN BUNDT:
Madame Berenger does not want it revealed that her mother used little restraint in matters of affection. 

---

But I am certain the Grand Duke fathered her. I have connected almost all the genealogical lines, but there is one last piece of evidence. 

---

When I find that, I will have the final proof of her lineage.

---

## MADEMOISELLE RASPAIL:
There is nothing we love more than haunting graveyards, rubbing stones, 

---

squinting at names in the shadows of a church rectory.

---

## HOLMES:
What do you have to say about the gentlemen who are haunting the premises of Berenger and Conneau Wine Merchants?

---

## MADEMOISELLE RASPAIL:
How could Fraulein Bundt know?

---

## WATSON:
You don't you feel a responsibility for the danger in which Mrs. Berenger finds herself?

---

## FRAULEIN BUNDT:
It was important the truth be known.

---

## HOLMES:
If it is the truth.

---

## FRAULEIN BUNDT:
I will prove it, Herr Holmes. Lily Berenger is of royal blood. 

---

And blood will out.

---

---

## HOLMES:
Are the Berengers safely tucked away in their room?

---

## WATSON:
I just went down the hall to check. In for the evening, the door locked and bolted.

---

## CONNEAU:
Mr. Holmes?

---

## HOLMES:
Monsieur Conneau.

---

## CONNEAU:
We didn’t have much chance to speak earlier today. 

---

I wanted to thank you for seeing to the protection of my friends. 

---

I’ve brought you this. It’s a Bordeaux ‘74.

---

## WATSON:
Château Pichon!

---

## CONNEAU:
It is my favorite.

---

## HOLMES:
I take it you are the wine enthusiast, and your partner the business side.

---

## CONNEAU:
Our cellars are part of the catacombs, dating back to the last century. 

---

I know Arnold is not easy to like. He can be, as you English say, a bit of a bull.

---

## WATSON:
A bit? He nearly struck me at Fortnum’s. Sent the crumpets every which way.

---

## CONNEAU:
Arnold thinks we’re all jumping at shadows, but those two Russians are real. 

---

And they are at this moment outside the hotel.

---

## WATSON:
What?

---

## CONNEAU:
On the Place Vendomme. I saw them both as I was coming in. 

---

Monsieur Holmes, you must do everything you can to protect her.

---

## HOLMES:
Her?

---

## CONNEAU:
Them. Lily and Arnold. Both.

---

## HOLMES:
Watson, our course of action is clear.

---

## WATSON:
We need to flush out these birds, but how?

---

## HOLMES:
We must make them follow Arnold Berenger.

---

## WATSON:
Put him in harm’s way?

---

## HOLMES:
By no means. You will make an admirable Arnold Berenger.

---

## WATSON:
You mean I’m to be a decoy?

---

## HOLMES:
Exactly so.

---

## WATSON:
And where will you be while I’m being followed by a pair of Russians?

---

## HOLMES:
I will be following them following you. Do not fret, there is no danger. 

---

You did bring your revolver, I hope.

---

---

[suspenseful music]

---

[a woman screams]


---

## WATSON:
LILY!

---

---

## INSPECTOR LUCERNE:
Dr. Watson I presume?

---

## WATSON:
John Watson, yes. Who are you?

---

## INSPECTOR LUCERNE:
Inspector Lucerne. I understand you and Monsieur Sherlock Holmes have been endeavoring to protect the inhabitants of this hotel suite.

---

## WATSON:
That’s right, Arnold Berenger and his wife.

---

## INSPECTOR LUCERNE:
You have done only half so good a job. Arnold Berenger is dead.

---

## WATSON:
My God! Lily!

---

## INSPECTOR LUCERNE:
Ah, the great Sherlock Holmes. Look upon your most recent success. 

---

Arnold Berenger dead, and Madame Berenger’s hands are tied up with those ropes.

---

## HOLMES:
Is she alive?

---

## WATSON:
Unconscious. I must get my bag.

---

## HOLMES:
How was he killed?

---

## INSPECTOR LUCERNE:
Stabbed.

---

## HOLMES:
A body with a blade. Any type will do, so long as it’s sharp enough to cut through fabric, flesh and bone. 

---

But where is the blade?

---

## INSPECTOR LUCERNE:
Missing. May I ask: What were you and Dr. Watson doing while your client was being murdered?

---

## HOLMES:
We were attempting to identify the men who threatened the Berengers.

---

## INSPECTOR LUCERNE:
No doubt you succeeded, which will make their arrest so much easier.

---

## HOLMES:
They split up. I’m afraid we lost them.

---

## INSPECTOR LUCERNE:
And by splitting up, they were able to divide your attention and come here to commit their crime.

---

## LILY:
John..?

---

## WATSON:
She’s coming to.

---

## LILY:
..John, is.. is Arnold...?

---

## WATSON:
I’m sorry, Lily. He’s dead.

---

## INSPECTOR LUCERNE:
Madame Berenger, these men, how did they get in?

---

## LILY:
We were about to go to bed. There was a knock on the door. 

---

Arnold opened it, suddenly two men were in the room and I was blindfolded.

---

## HOLMES:
Mrs. Berenger, you have suffered a great shock, but think, can you recall any details at all about these men?

---

## LILY:
Hats and long coats, I couldn’t tell you more. 

---

The moment they put the blindfold on me, I lost consciousness.

---

## WATSON:
You’ve had a lucky escape, Lily.

---

## LILY:
Lucky for me. Not for poor Arnold.

---

---

## WATSON:
Holmes? Have you been in the Berengers’ room all night?

---

## HOLMES:
I fear so. I confess to being rather shaken by the events of last evening. 

---

It does not reflect well on my reputation to lose a client in so ignominious a fashion.

---

## WATSON:
At least we can comfort ourselves that Lily is safe.

---

## HOLMES:
Yes. Thoughtful of you to have her room changed.

---

## WATSON:
She couldn’t stay in here where her husband was murdered.

---

## HOLMES:
Also thoughtful of you to spend the night with her.

---

## WATSON:
How’d you know that?

---

## HOLMES:
Same shirt collar as yesterday.

---

## WATSON:
Lily asked me to stay with her. I was keeping watch.

---

## HOLMES:
If you say so.

---

## WATSON:
Holmes, I assure you nothing happened --

---

## HOLMES:
Yes, quite. Tell me, Watson, does anything strike you as curious about the crime scene?

---

## WATSON:
The missing blade, I suppose.

---

## HOLMES:
What else?

---

## WATSON:
Well...

---

## HOLMES:
Arnold Berenger was killed but not tied up. Lily Berenger was tied up but not killed. 

---

Why do you suppose that was?

---

## WATSON:
Likely they intended to kill him and kidnap her.

---

## HOLMES:
If kidnapping her was their intention, why didn’t they?

---

## WATSON:
They must have panicked when they’d killed Berenger.

---

## HOLMES:
But if killing Berenger was their intention, why would they panic?

---

## WATSON:
I don’t know.

---

## HOLMES:
And this. Arnold Berenger’s sword stick.

---

## WATSON:
The murder weapon?

---

## HOLMES:
No. Wrong kind of blade for the wound. But he didn’t unsheath it. 

---

A knock on the door in the middle of the night, and he doesn’t unsheath it. 

---

Why? Watson, ask Mrs. Berenger to join us, would you?

---

## WATSON:
Now?

---

## HOLMES:
I want to test a theory.

---

## LILY:
Mr. Holmes. John says you have a theory.

---

## HOLMES:
I do. Would you be kind enough to show Dr. Watson your hands? 

---

## LILY:
Certainly.

---


## HOLMES:
Watson, what do you see?

---

## WATSON:
Perfection.

---

## HOLMES:
Just so. Last night, you said these two intruders tied your hands together.

---

## LILY:
Yes.

---

## HOLMES:
Watson, would you tie Mrs. Berenger’s hands with this length of rope?

---

## WATSON:
What?

---

## HOLMES:
As if you mean to restrain her.

---

## LILY:
I don’t understand the purpose of this experiment.

---

## HOLMES:
Please, oblige me.

---

## LILY:
If I must.

---

## HOLMES: 
Tightly, Watson. Very good. Was it something like that? 

---

## LILY: 
Exactly like.

---

## HOLMES:
Now, try to get free of those bonds.

---

## LILY:
I can’t.

---

## HOLMES:
Try harder.

---

## LILY:
It’s hurting.

---

## WATSON:
Holmes--

---

## HOLMES:
Nicely done knot then, eh? You may remove them, Watson.

---

## LILY:
Please hurry, John, it stings!

---

## HOLMES:
You will forgive me, Mrs. Berenger, I would not inconvience you if I hadn't a reason. 


---

Problem, Watson?

---


## WATSON:
I can’t find my scalpel. Here, I’ll untie you.

---

## HOLMES:
Now please examine Mrs. Berenger’s wrists.

---

## WATSON:
What am I looking for?

---

## HOLMES:
Just tell me what you observe.

---

## WATSON:
Abrasions. The rope cut into her skin as she struggled.

---

## HOLMES:
Did you see any evidence of similar abrasions last night?

---

## WATSON:
I-I... don’t recall.

---

## HOLMES:
There were none, isn’t that so?

---

## LILY:
What are you saying?

---

## HOLMES:
That who tied you up didn’t wish you harm.

---

## LILY:
How dare you? How dare you? My husband is dead, I may be next and you suggest I am culpable?

---

## WATSON:
Holmes isn’t  saying --

---

## HOLMES:
What I’m saying is that whoever murdered your husband has rather too much concern for your well-being.

---

## LILY:
The men who attacked me gave me no indication that they wished to spare me discomfort! 

---

I have lost my husband! My life is in ruins!

---

## WATSON:
Lily, don’t upset yourself.

---

## LILY:
No! Leave me alone!

---

## WATSON:
Holmes, that was unworthy of you! This woman came to us for help in her darkest hour and you suggest, 

---

no, more than suggest, you assert that she’s involved in this!

---

## HOLMES:
I assert there is something she’s not telling us.

---

## WATSON:
She’s been under a great pressure. You’re expecting rather a lot of the woman.

---

## HOLMES:
And you’re being uncommonly credulous. 

---

You could see as well as I that there were no marks on her wrists last night. 

---

If this were any other woman, you would have brought that to my attention. 

---

Why in her case did you not? 

---

Are you too much affected by her charms? Her anxious eyes?

---

## WATSON:
This is absurd!

---

## HOLMES:
The two of you had quite a communication going on whilst I was away. What was the tenor of your letters?

---

## WATSON:
What you’re implying is not only incorrect but grossly impertinent.

---

## HOLMES:
You have been without a wife for many years. 

---

Lilly Berenger is an attractive woman who was, until last night, married to an unpleasant husband.

---

## WATSON:
Damnit, Holmes, it is only in consideration for our long friendship that I -- !

---

## HOLMES:
Watson, if you raise a fist, I will be forced to let you pummel me. 

---

...Now that’s over, will you accompany me on a visit?

---

## WATSON:
Where?

---

## HOLMES:
Fraulein Bundt. If the Russians have put Lily Berenger in their sights, 

---

it’s fair to assume the person trying to prove her bona fides may be next.

---

---

## WATSON:
Good lord.

---



They’ve both been dead for some time. 

---

Now we’ll never know if Fraulein Bundt found that last piece of evidence.

---

## WATSON:
What’s that?

---

## HOLMES:
Chateau Pichon ‘74. Empty.

---

## INSPECTOR LUCERNE:
Dr. Watson and Monsieur Holmes: Wherever you go, a body is found. 

---

Although this time you have outdone yourselves. Two bodies. Have you made any discoveries?

---

## HOLMES:
Just that they were poisoned. 

---

You can smell the arsenic in the dried remnants of the glass in Mademoiselle Raspail’s hand.

---

## INSPECTOR LUCERNE:
Chateau Pichon ‘74.

---

## HOLMES:
Georges Conneau’s favorite.

---

## WATSON:
We must talk to him at once.

---



## INSPECTOR LUCERNE:
That will be difficult. I went to Monsieur Conneau’s flat this morning to ask his whereabouts last night. 

---

Monsieur Conneau was not there. But in his closet I found this... 

---

It’s the kind of rope used to bind wine crates. And sometimes to tie a woman’s hands.

---

## HOLMES:
Although not so tightly as to harm her.

---

## INSPECTOR LUCERNE:
Also found at Monsieur Conneau’s..

---



...a note

---

## HOLMES:
“Dearest Lily. I love you desperately. Now it is over. Nothing stands in our way. Signed, Georges.”

---



Such a wealth of incriminating evidence. Was there also a blade found?

---

## INSPECTOR LUCERNE:
No, the murder weapon has yet to turn up.

---

## HOLMES:
Inspector, if Georges Conneau masterminded all this, is it really plausible that he’d leave behind quite so many clues? 

---

The mind behind these murders is a much more clever and calculating one.

---

## INSPECTOR LUCERNE:
You mean to point the finger at Madame Berenger.

---

## HOLMES:
She couldn’t have done it alone. To tie those ropes required an accomplice.

---

## WATSON:
Hang on, you’re talking as though Lily were complicit in this. Surely you can see she’s being set up.

---

## HOLMES:
It would appear there is some manipulation at work.

---

## WATSON:
Then do something!

---

## HOLMES:
This is Inspector Lucerne’s investigation, I am but a bystander.

---

## INSPECTOR LUCERNE:
Exactamente. And now I must go, to arrest Madame Berenger.

---

## WATSON:
Damn you, Holmes!

---

---

## INSPECTOR LUCERNE:
Allons-y, madame! Dégagez! Degagez! !

---

## ELOISE:
Madame Berenger, que voulezvous que je fasse?

---

## LILY:
Ne t’inquiète pas, Eloïse, tout ira bien.

---

## WATSON:
Lily, I’ll get you out, I promise you.

---

## LILY:
John, you know I didn’t --

---

## WATSON:
Lily!

---

## INSPECTOR LUCERNE:
Allons-y, madame. Viens avec nous. Degasez!

---

## ELOISE:
The inspector says Monsieur Conneau killed Monsieur Bergenger, but he could not have done this.

---

## HOLMES:
Why couldn’t he, Eloise?

---

## ELOISE:
Because I know his heart. Georges Conneau, he is an honest man.

---

## WATSON:
“Georges Conneau was missing, presumed to have fled the country. 

---

The trial was swift, the prosecution’s case compelling. 

---

And then the accused took the stand...”

---

## ADVOCATE (V.O.)

Madame Berenger, you told the police that on the night of the murder, 

---

two Russians tied you up with rope and stabbed your husband to death. 

---

Please tell the court, is this true?

---

## LILY:
No. I lied.

---
## CROWD MURMUR (V.O.): 
I lied.

---

## ADVOCATE (V.O.):
Do you realize what you’re admitting to?

---

## LILY:
Yes. And it has driven me nearly mad to keep it all inside until now.

---

## ADVOCATE (V.O.):
What did happen the night of your husband’s murder?

---

## LILY:
Arnold had gone to bed. There was a knock on the door.

---
[Door Knock]

---


## LILY:
Georges?

---

## GEORGES:
Where is Arnold?

---

## LILY:
In bed, asleep, I --

---

## LILY:
Georges, stop, what are you doing?

---

## GEORGES:
I love you, Lily, since the day I first saw you.

---

## LILY:
But you’re our friend, Arnold’s friend!

---

## GEORGES:
You do not love him, you could not love a man like that! That is why I planned this!

---

## LILY:
Planned..?

---

## GEORGES:
His death. I will kill him, and we will say the Russians did it. 

---

Lily, say that you love me!

---

## LILY:
No! I don't love you! I could never love you!


---

## GEORGES:
Never.. is very long.

---

## ARNOLD:
Georges? What the hell are you doing here?

---

## GEORGES:
If I cannot have you, no one will!

---

## ARNOLD:
Aggh!

---

## LILY:
It was a Georges I’d never seen before. His green, glowing eyes were filled with a jealous madness. 

---

Arnold never had a chance to defend himself. 

---

Once he was dead, Georges tied me up and told me to say the Russians had broken in, 

---

so the police would think I had nothing to do with Arnold’s murder.

---

## ADVOCATE (V.O.):
Madame Berenger, until today you have told nothing but lies about the case.

---

Why should the court believe you now?

---

## LILY:
Georges said that if I told anyone he had committed the murder he would see to it that the evidence pointed to me. 

---

And it has. I beseech the court, please believe me! As God is my judge, I did not kill my husband!

---
[Gavel]

---


---
[Jail Door]

---

## HOLMES:
Mrs. Berenger, I must commend you on your moving and dramatic testimony today. 

---

If I were a member of the jury, I would vote to acquit.

---

## LILY:
Thank you.

---

## HOLMES:
I did not mean it as a compliment.

---

## LILY:
Do you have something you wish to say to me, Mr. Holmes? 

---

The jury will be returning shortly with its verdict.

---

## HOLMES:
Then I will be brief. Let me begin by describing my first visit to Fraulein Bundt.

---

## HOLMES:
On that occasion, she showed me a reproduction Vernet which she had framed.

---

## FRAULEIN BUNDT:
There is a family tree behind this, don’t you suspect?

---

## HOLMES:
She made quite a point of saying that.

---

## FRAULEIN BUNDT:
There is a family tree behind this.

---

## HOLMES:
So much so that I felt she was giving me a clue. So, I broke into her flat and found hidden behind the backing of that Vernet…

---

## HOLMES:
A genealogical tree. Not for the Holmes family or the Romanovs, but for the Berenger Family. 

---

This, I believe, is how it all began: Fraulein Bundt came to see Arnold Berenger...

---

## LILY:
I’m afraid my husband is not at home. Perhaps you might share whatever exciting news you have.. with me.

---

## FRAULEIN BUNDT:

May I ask: is your husband close to his family?

---

## LILY:
His parents are dead, he has no siblings. I’ve never heard him speak of other relatives.

---

## FRAULEIN BUNDT:
That is because he does not know. This is a genealogical tree of the Berenger Family. You see this branch? 

---

This is your husband’s great uncle. Before his recent death, he made a great deal of money in the West Indies. 

---

Having no offspring, he left his entire fortune to your husband’s side of the family.

---

## LILY:
To Arnold?

---

## FRAULEIN BUNDT:
Unfortunately, no. The inheritance skips a generation. 

---

But if you bear your husband a male offspring, your son will be made very wealthy.

---

## LILY:
Heavens! And Arnold doesn’t know this?

---

## FRAULEIN BUNDT:
He does not.

---

## HOLMES:
So you had a different idea.

---

## LILY:
Fraulein Bundt, I’d like to make you a proposal.

---

## FRAULEIN BUNDT:
Oh, ja?

---

## LILY:
Keep this news from my husband and I will give you a share of the Berenger fortune - if you concoct for me another family tree, 

---

a fictional one that connects me with, oh, I know! The Russian Royal Family!

---

## HOLMES:
Then you pulled Georges Conneau into your trap.

---

## LILY:
Arnold is a beast! I’m in fear for my life!

---

## CONNEAU:
Shhh! I’ll come up with a plan.

---

## HOLMES:
Next you lured John Watson into your web.

---

## WATSON:
Two days ago, I received this.

---

## LILY:
“My dear John, Apparently I am Russian princess! 

---

Now there are men, also Russian, lurking about my husband’s wine establishment.”

---

## HOLMES:
When we arrived to investigate, you had Conneau tell us:

---

## CONNEAU:
I couldn’t see the Russians’ faces, but they wear black overcoats and bowler hats.

---

## HOLMES:
You had Mademoiselle Raspail and Fraulein Bundt disguise themselves.

---

## FRAULEIN BUNDT:
Hat.

---

## MADEMOISELLE RASPAIL:
Hat.

---

## FRAULEIN BUNDT:
Cloak.

---

## MADEMOISELLE RASPAIL:
Cloak.

---

## HOLMES:
Once they commenced to lead us on a chase, you let Georges Conneau into your hotel room.

---

## ARNOLD:
Georges? What are you doing here?


---

Aggh!

---

## LILY:
Now the rope. Be gentle with me.

---

## HOLMES:
The next morning, you began eliminating your accomplices.

---

## FRAULEIN BUNDT:
A gift?

---

## MADEMOISELLE RASPAIL:
Chateau Pichon!

---

## HOLMES:
The vintage Georges Conneau was known to favor. You went to see Conneau at his flat.

---

## LILY:
Georges, the police are after you!

---

## GEORGES:
I must flee!

---

## HOLMES:
Once you’d sent him on his way, you left that coil of rope and the forged love letter. 

---

My role was to discover all the clues you planted to incriminate him: 

---

the ropes that left no abrasions, the Russians only Georges Conneau saw, his fondness for Chateau Pichon. 

---

All so that you alone could enjoy the spoils of your crime: the Berenger fortune, a fortune which your son will inherit but you will control.

---

## LILY:
My son?

---

## HOLMES:
Do you recall what your maid told you at our first meeting:

---

## ELOISE:
La couturiere est là pour sortir vos robes.

---

## HOLMES:
A seamstress had arrived to let out your dresses. 

---

That, along with your revulsion at certain foods and the smell tobacco suggest you are with child. 

---

Your husband didn’t know this, of course. I had his medical records sent to me. 

---

Arnold Berenger was incapable of fathering a child. A case of mumps. 

---

So, he cannot be the father. The father is Georges Conneau.

---

## LILY:
My, I am a terrible person. But apparently not clever enough to avoid being tried for murder.

---

## HOLMES:
That was your masterstroke: to orchestrate your own arrest so that you could give that performance today in court.

---

Watching you tear the truth out of yourself, it was like the last act of MEDEA.

---

I wasn't surprised to learn that previous to your marriage, you were an actress.

---

## LILY:
I never played MEDEA, Mr. Holmes, just maids. Well, this is absolutely mesmerizing.

---

Unfortunately, only Georges Conneau could confirm what you've alleged, and he has disappeared.

---

## HOLMES:
He would appear to have disappeared. However, just yesterday…

---

## ELOISE:
Monsieur Conneau?

---

---

## ELOISE:
Monsieur Conneau!

---

## CONNEAU:
Eloise?

---

## ELOISE:
I brought you food.

---

## HOLMES:
Enough for about a week, I should think.

---

## CONNEAU:
Why did you bring him here?

---

## HOLMES:
Don’t blame Eloise. I followed her. 

---

It makes perfect sense that you’d choose the catacombs beneath your wine cellar to hide.

---



Sausage, cheese, bread... and Château Pichon. 

---

Same as what finished off Fraulein Bundt and Mademoiselle Raspail. 

---

## CONNEAU:
They’re dead?

---

## HOLMES:
Where did you get this bottle?

---

## ELOISE:
From Monsieur Conneau’s private stock.

---

## HOLMES:
And easily accessible to Mrs. Berenger.

---

## GEORGES:
What are you talking about?

---

## HOLMES:
I wouldn’t drink from it if I were you. Lily Berenger is responsible for three deaths already, she intended to make you the fourth. 

---

The only way to frustrate her plot is for you to tell the truth.

---

## CONNEAU:
The truth is she was in danger! She begged me for help! Arnold would have killed her otherwise!

---

## HOLMES:
That’s what she wanted you to believe.

---

## CONNEAU:
You saw how he treated her!

---

## ELOISE:
And I saw how she treated him when she thought they were alone! 

---

The way she would taunt him! 

---

That’s why he was so unpleasant when other men were with her, it was his only way of getting back at her!

---

## HOLMES:
And he took you into his confidence.

---

## ELOISE:
Monsieur Berenger was not a kind man, but he never laid a hand on his wife.

---

## GEORGES:
...If I testify against Lily, it would mean years in prison.

---

## HOLMES:
Given the circumstances - and my supporting testimony - I have every reason to hope for your acquittal.

---

## ELOISE:
Monsieur Georges, please.

---

## CONNEAU:
..I cannot.

---

## HOLMES:
No, you are still too much under the woman’s spell. You need proof. Very well. 

---

Tomorrow, Lily Berenger takes the stand in her defense. 

---

She will blame you and you alone for these murders. That shall be your proof.

---

## CONNEAU:
How will I know that she has testified as you say she will?

---

## HOLMES:
Mademoiselle Eloise will act as our go-between. When I give her the nod, she will deliver the news and bring you to the court.

---

## GEORGES:
And if you’re wrong?

---

## HOLMES:
Then the message to Mademoiselle Eloise will be a shake of the head and you must flee France forever.

---

---

## LILY:
My. I am a mastermind.

---

## HOLMES:
All that remains is that I send word to Georges Conneau that you have put the blame on him and insist that the Judge halt the trial until his arrival.

---

## LILY:
Mr. Holmes. You have lived up to your reputation. Your certainty, your superiority, are dazzling. 

---

I suppose that’s what most frustrates poor John. At least that’s what he suggested to me.

---

## HOLMES:
You may stop there, madame.

---

## LILY:
We exchanged many letters, John and I, about my travails with Arnold. John was outraged. 

---

One of his letters I recall most specifically: “My dear Lily, To remove your husband from your life, I would commit murder itself.”

---

## HOLMES:
John Watson is a valiant man of good heart. He has also, since the death of his wife, been a lost soul.

---

## LILY:
And a fool to put such an effusive offer to commit murder into a letter. A letter now hidden in a very safe place.

---

## HOLMES:
The evidence of one letter isn’t enough to--

---

## LILY:
Inspector Lucerne arrested me on less evidence than that. 

---

Once I’m acquitted, he’ll be eager to find a new culprit and make the charges stick. 

---

And he will, when John’s letter is accompanied by another piece of evidence: 

---

the missing murder weapon, an object of about six inches in length made of tempered steel. 

---

His medical scalpel. With his initials on it. Also hidden away.

---

## HOLMES:
You stole it from him. The night you asked Watson to stay in your room. You took it then.

---

## LILY:
You can’t imagine I asked him to stay with me for any other reason. If his scalpel and that letter are presented to the police, John Watson will face the guillotine.

---

## HOLMES:
I’ll speak for him. I’ll testify that you -

---

## LILY:
And who will the court believe? A man desperate to defend his friend, or the woman who has already moved them to tears? 

---

Do you really want to put your dear Watson through all that?

---

## LILY:
Now you understand why you will not insist that the judge halt the trial nor send your message to Georges Conneau.

---

## HOLMES:
I have been bested by a woman only once before, but you, madam, have no equal of your sex in cunning and ruthlessness. 

---

For the sake of my friend, I must accede to your terms. 

---

But I warn you: you have eluded justice for the moment, but I swear I will find a way to bring you to account. 

---

Perhaps not today, perhaps not in ten years time, but you will pay for this crime.

---

## LILY:
Good hunting, Mr. Holmes.

---

---

## WATSON:
Lily Berenger has been acquitted..

---

## HOLMES:
Yes, she was remarkably convincing on the witness stand.

---

## WATSON:
And you didn’t lift a hand to help. You did your best to hound her to a murder conviction for no reason at all.

---

## WATSON:
Wasn’t that the Berenger’s maid?

---

## HOLMES:
Eloise. A good and kind young woman. She and the object of her affections have a rough road ahead of them.

---

## WATSON:
Object of her affections?

---

## HOLMES:
She’s been in love with Georges Conneau for a long time.

---

## WATSON:
Conneau is a murderer, and now he’s fled to who knows where.

---

## HOLMES:
Well, one day there may be someone who will shine a lamp on this business and reveal Georges Conneau to be an honest man.

---

## WATSON:
Lily! I can’t tell you how happy I am to see you free.

---

## LILY:
Thank you, Dr. Watson. You and Mr. Holmes were most useful. Indispensable, in fact.

---

## WATSON:
What will you do now?

---

## LILY:
Travel, I think. Italy perhaps.

---

## WATSON:
Excellent idea. I’ve often thought of visiting Florence, Venice, Rome. I don’t suppose...

---

## LILY:
Don’t suppose what?

---

## WATSON:
Well, I only thought...well...perhaps we...might go together?

---

## LILY:
Why?

---

## WATSON:
You can’t deny that in the brief time we’ve known each other, there’s been...surely you’ve felt it too...

---

a warmth of feeling, a mutual affection?

---

## LILY:
“A warmth of feeling?” Are you serious? 

---

Do you really expect I would run off with a hotel physician I barely know?

---

## WATSON:
Lily, I don’t understand. Your letters...?

---

## LILY:
Written in emotional turmoil in order to save my husband! 

---

Did you think they were love letters?

---

## WATSON:
I don’t understand.

---

## LILY:
You ought to print that on your calling cards. “Dr. John Watson: ‘I Don’t Understand.’”

---

## WATSON:
Lily--

---

## LILY:
Mrs. Berenger. And if any other reason were necessary to put off your unwanted advances, I am with child! 

---

I do hope it will be a boy.

---

## WATSON:
But I ... I --

---

## LILY:
Don’t worry, if you’re truly in the dark, just do what you always do: ask your friend Sherlock Holmes to explain it to you.

---

## HOLMES:
John --

---

## WATSON:
I don’t want explanations or theories or speculations! Not about this! Just... 

---

just leave me alone.

---

## WATSON:
“I never saw Lily Berenger again. I still think of her--”love is not love that alters when it alteration finds”.

---



Ironically, like Holmes with Irene Adler, I now find myself referring to her as “The Woman.” 

---

My friendship with Holmes survived. But the subject of Lily Berenger was a no man’s land where neither of us could safely tread. 

---

“The Case of the Anxious Eyes” was counted as one of Holmes’ rare, and in this instance, fully deserved failures, 

---

not only as a detective, but as a man. 

---

I only hope that in time Sherlock Holmes will see the error in his ways 

---

and the damage he has done to a woman’s reputation, and to my heart.”

---

## HOLMES:
Dear Fellow-traveler. 

---

If you are reading this you have already taken your first steps toward righting a gross miscarriage of justice and perhaps saving a reputation. 

---

I urge you to continue your journey and have provided guideposts, lanterns to light your way. 

---

There is one piece of the puzzle missing, which only time will reveal and you must strive to find. 

---

As you will see, if the solution to this mystery does exist, “the eyes have it.”

---

## INTERMISSION

---

## HASTINGS:
“It was a sunny morning in May of 1921 when I came down to breakfast to find my good friend Hercule Poirot in a state of heightened anticipation.”

---

## POIROT:
My dear Hastings, look what I hold in my hand. A special delivery letter from France. Merlinville-sur-Mer.

---

## PAUL MCQUEEN:
“Monsieur Poirot, I am in need of the services of a detective. I am convinced that men from my past wish my immediate and violent death. 

---

I beg you lose no time in crossing to France. I will send a car to meet you at the Merlinville station. Yours, Paul McQueen.”

---

## HASTINGS:
Paul McQueen’s that American oil man. Will you go?

---

## POIROT:
We both will go. Merlinville is known for those little green links which I believe are of such interest to you and your little sticks. 

---

The Continental Express leaves Victoria at 11 o’clock. You will accompany me, mon ami?

---

## HASTINGS:
Let me pack my clubs.


---
[Train Whistle]

---

## HASTINGS:
“We wasted no time in catching the next boat train. 

---

However, when we arrived at the station we found no car waiting for us, so we took a taxi to the home of Paul McQueen where we were surprised by...”

---

---

## INSPECTOR GIRAUD:
Inspector Giraud. You are, I believe, Hercule Poirot?

---

## POIROT:
I am. This is my associate Captain Hastings. We are here at the invitation of Mr. Paul McQueen.

---

## INSPECTOR GIRAUD:
“I am convinced that men from my past wish my immediate and violent death.” 

---

You have arrived too late. Paul McQueen has been murdered.

---

## HASTINGS:
Murdered how?

---

## INSPECTOR GIRAUD:
Stabbed. Death was immediate and violent.

---

## POIROT:
Where was the murder committed?

---

## INSPECTOR GIRAUD:
At the 16th hole of the Merlinville Golf Course.

---

## HASTINGS:
Poirot, you promised me a trip to the links, but I didn’t think it would be so soon.

---

## POIROT:
Is the body still there?

---

## INSPECTOR GIRAUD:
It has just been removed to the police morgue. Would you like to observe?

---

## POIROT:
But of course.

---

---

## INSPECTOR GIRAUD:
Monsieur McQueen was killed between midnight and two o’clock in the morning. 

---

He was stabbed with this letter opener. No fingerprints. He was wearing this suit.

---

## POIROT:
Not a very good suit for such a wealthy man. But these gloves are good and this is cashmere. 

---

Was he wearing this overcoat?

---

## INSPECTOR GIRAUD:
Over his shoulders. In one of its pocket was this note: “I love you. If I can’t have you, no one will.” 

---

It is signed “B.D.”

---

## POIROT:
B.D. Is there a widow?

---

## INSPECTOR GIRAUD:
There is. Those are not her initials.

---

## POIROT:
Was anything else found?

---

## INSPECTOR GIRAUD:
Just this piece of lead pipe.

---

## POIROT:
“Just a piece of lead pipe.” It was found where?

---

## INSPECTOR GIRAUD:
Next to the body.

---

## POIROT:
Is there construction of any sort going on nearby? Irrigation? Plumbing?

---

## INSPECTOR GIRAUD:
The lead pipe is not important.

---

## POIROT:
I grant it is not blood-stained. I grant it seems not to have been used in the attack. 

---

But its presence is, contrary to your opinion, very significant.

---

## MRS. MCQUEEN:
Where is he? Where’s my husband?

---

## INSPECTOR GIRAUD:
The widow.

The pathologist is just finishing his examination.

---

## POIROT:
Madame, I am Hercule Poirot, this is my associate Captain Hastings.

---

## MRS. MCQUEEN:
You’re the detective my husband wrote to. Now we know he was not wrong in his fears.

---

## POIROT:
Can you tell us, madame, what happened last night?

---

## MRS. MCQUEEN:
We had retired around midnight, there was a knock at our bedroom door. 

---

My husband opened it, two men forced their way in and tied me up.

---

## POIROT:
Tied you how?

---

## INSPECTOR GIRAUD:
In a chair, her hands behind her.

---

## POIROT:
Comme c’est épouvantable! And then...?

---

## MRS. MCQUEEN:
Then they took my husband away, and.. and they killed him.

---

## POIROT:
May I see your wrists, Madame?

---

## MRS. MCQUEEN:

Yes.

---

## POIROT:
They are cut badly.

---

## MRS. MCQUEEN:
The ropes were tied very tightly.

---

## POIROT:
Did these men say anything?

---

## MRS. MCQUEEN:
They told me to keep quiet or they’d kill me. They were Americans.

---

## HASTINGS:
You and your husband are from America, aren’t you?

---

## MRS. MCQUEEN:
That’s where Paul built his company. There were a lot of rough and tumble men in those oil fields. 

---

I can only imagine some old business reared its head.

---

## INSPECTOR GIRAUD:
And last night that old business came for him.

---

## POIROT:
Why did you come here from America?

---

## MRS. MCQUEEN:
It was Paul’s dream to retire to France. We’d only been here a few months. 

---

We hadn’t even begun to learn the language...


---
[Door Opening]

---

## JACK:
Mother, I came as soon as I heard.

---

## MRS. MCQUEEN:
Jack? Erm, this is Inspector Giraud, and Mr. Poirot and Captain Hastings whom your father engaged. 

---

This is my son, Jack. I thought you’d be on the boat to New York by now.

---

## POIROT:
New York? By way of..?

---

## JACK:
Cherbourg. I spent the night there. 

---

The ship was to set sail this morning, but when I saw the news of father’s death in the papers, I came back to Merlinville.

---

## POIROT:
Why were you to go to New York?

---

## JACK:
Business. Stockholders meeting. My father ordered me to.

---

## POIROT:
When did he do this?

---

## JACK:
Just yesterday. Told me to leave at once. I didn’t want to go, but he insisted.

---

## POIROT:
Something?

---

## JACK:
Hm? No. Nothing.

---

## INSPECTOR GIRAUD:
This letter opener. Do either of you recognize it?

---

## MRS. MCQUEEN:
It’s mine. Those men must’ve taken it from my dressing table.

---

## POIROT:
Do you know anyone with the initials B.D. who may have had reason to kill your husband?

---

## MRS. MCQUEEN:
No.

---

## JACK:
Can’t think of a one.

---

## MRS. MCQUEEN:
Is that…?

---

## INSPECTOR GIRAUD:
Madame McQueen has agreed to make the official identification of the body. 

---

Are you sure you want to go through with this?

---

## MRS. MCQUEEN:
Paul? No! No, it can’t be! Paul!

---

## POIROT:
Hastings, smelling salts.

---

## POIROT:
Monsieur McQueen, is this your father?

---

## JACK:
Yes. It’s him.

---

## INSPECTOR GIRAUD:
You positively identify  this --

---

## JACK:
That’s enough, Inspector, we’ve given you what you need. I must see to my mother.

---

## INSPECTOR GIRAUD:
So, Poirot, you will be returning to London now, I think?

---

## POIROT:
No, Giraud, I will not be returning to London now, I think. 

---

I was engaged by letter to protect Paul McQueen’s life.

---

## INSPECTOR GIRAUD:
And see how well you did succeed.

---

## POIROT:
Vraiment. Now it is my solemn duty to catch his murderer.

---

## INSPECTOR GIRAUD:
Pah! You will not catch his murderer, I will catch his murderer.

---

## POIROT:
Will you put a wager to that?

---

## INSPECTOR GIRAUD:
I never turn down a wager.

---

## POIROT:
And the stakes?

---

## INSPECTOR GIRAUD:
If I catch the killer, you will tell all the press that a French detective has bested a Belgian detective.

---

## POIROT:
D’accord. And when I catch the killer... you will carry Captain Hastings clubs for a round of golf.

---

## INSPECTOR GIRAUD:
D’accord.

---

## POIROT:
And on that subject, how close is the golf course to Chez McQueen?

---

## INSPECTOR GIRAUD:
The McQueen house borders the 16th green.

---

## POIROT:
Are there other houses nearby?

---

## INSPECTOR GIRAUD:
Just the villa of the Comtesse Delabegassier. She lives there with her lady's companion.

---

---

## COMTESSE DELABEGASSIER:
Paul McQueen dead? So terrible! Martha and I came to Merlinville only a months ago, but he was in every way a charming neighbor.

---

## POIROT:
Comtesse, did you notice any unusual activity last evening between midnight and two o’clock?

---

## COMTESSE DELABEGASSIER:
I notice nothing. I am all the time confined to this chair. I..

---

## MARTHA:
The Comtesse was in the Balvano railway accident 10 years ago.

---

## POIROT:
I remember it. Tres tragique.

---

## COMTESSE DELABEGASSIER:
I take pills for the pain, and the pills make me sleep, and when I sleep, I am dead to the world. 

---

Martha stays with me.

---

## POIROT:
In the comtesse’s room?

---


## MARTHA:
Yes.

---


## POIROT:
All night? 

---


## MARTHA:
All night.

---

## COMTESSE DELABEGASSIER:
And now if you will excuse, it is time for my nap. Martha?

---

## MARTHA:
Yes, Comtesse. Oh, Monsieur Poirot. You asked if there had been any unusual activity. 

---

It wasn’t last night, but the day before yesterday. 

---

The Comtesse’s bedroom window overlooks the garden of the McQueen’s house. 

---

In the afternoon while the Comtesse was napping, I overheard an argument between Mr. McQueen and a man I’d never seen before.

---

## POIROT:
So you did more than hear this argument, you also peeked?

---

## MARTHA:
The man was asking for money. Mr.and Mrs. McQueen threatened to put the law on him. 

---

I couldn’t tell much about the man except that he wore a shabby suit. He looked like a tramp.

---

## POIROT:
This tramp was not mentioned by Mrs. McQueen.

---

## MARTHA:
She’s probably so distressed.

---

## HASTINGS:
Fortunately, her son is caring for her.

---

## MARTHA:
But Jack’s on his way to New York.

---

## HASTINGS:
He returned from Cherbourg when he learned of his father’s death.

---

## MARTHA:
Poor Jack.

---


## COMTESSE DELABEGASSIER:
Martha.

---

## MARTHA:
Yes, Comtesse, forgive me!

---

## COMTESSE DELABEGASSIER:
Such a stupid girl. But so good at massaging the feet.

---

## HASTINGS:
I say, what an extraordinary, stunningly beautiful woman.

---

## POIROT:
The Comtesse?

---

## HASTINGS:
Her companion. Martha. Such anxious yet bewitching green eyes.

---

## POIROT:
What did you say?

---

## HASTINGS:
Martha. She has anxious eyes.

---

## POIROT:
Elle fait en effet! I deserve to be kicked from here to the Moulin Rouge!

---

## HASTINGS:
What do you mean?

---

## POIROT:
My little mustaches, they are tingling. A husband stabbed to death. The wife tied up. And anxious eyes. 

---

The details of this crime recall another case many years ago. 

---

It is like a Punch and Judy show in which all the heads have been switched. 

---

I must find a library and seek out a book. 

---

I leave you in charge. I will tell Inspector Giraud to treat you as he would me, by which I mean he will insult you.

---

## HASTINGS:
What shall I do while you’re gone?

---

## POIROT:
To quote the man who was Mark Twain, you must ruin a good walk. Golf!

---

---

## BELLA:
Playing through! Oh, dear. You seem to have got yourself stuck in the rough.

---

## HASTINGS:
It’s my usual situation. I seem to have misplaced my ball. I say, you’re English.

---

## BELLA:
Yes. I’m staying at the Hotel d’Angleterre.

---

## HASTINGS:
Ah. They, uh, they say this is the best course on the French coast.

---

## BELLA:
Do they? I was hoping to play with a partner but couldn’t find anyone. I’m alone, you see.

---

## HASTINGS:
Are you? Well, erm, perhaps you’d consider joining me?

---

## BELLA:
You don’t let the grass grow under your feet, do you?

---

## HASTINGS:
Oh! Here, I didn’t --

---

## BELLA:
I’m joking! I’d love to, actually. I tried to play earlier today, but there were all these men with uniforms about.

---

## HASTINGS:
That would have been the police. I’m afraid there was a murder done here last night.

---

## BELLA:
Really? Does that mean you’re the murderer?

---

## HASTINGS:
Ha. No. I’m Arthur Hastings, a close associate of the detective Hercule Poirot who is assisting in the investigation.

---

## BELLA:
And you’re assisting him? Then you’re a detective too. And a rather dashing one!

---

## HASTINGS:
Well, I...

---

## BELLA:
The body was found right here?

---



Was it so, so terrible?

---

## HASTINGS:
It was, rather. He was stabbed to death.

---

## BELLA:
Stabbed with what? 

---

## HASTINGS:
A letter opener.

---

## BELLA:
Was he reading a letter at the time?

---

## HASTINGS:
Erm, well -

---

## BELLA:
Was it positively dripping with blood?

---

## HASTINGS:
Dry blood, but still.

---

## BELLA:
I imagine they keep all those murder things in a, oh, what do they call it?

---

## HASTINGS:
An evidence chamber.

---

## BELLA:
Do you have access to it? I’ve never seen a real murder weapon.

---

## HASTINGS:
Actually, I do have some access.

---

## BELLA:
Take me.

---

## HASTINGS:
I’m sorry?

---

## BELLA:
To see the evidence.

---

## HASTINGS:
Oh, yes, quite. You really want to see?

---

## BELLA:
Well, I don’t want to play golf now.

---

## HASTINGS:
Poirot did leave me in charge of things. I suppose I could manage it, if you flattered me a little more.

---

## BELLA:
It’s not flattery if it’s true. I’ll throw off my niblick. We can come back later for your ball.

---

---

## BELLA:
Oh, my. What’s this placed called?

---

## HASTINGS:
The morgue.

---

## BELLA:
That means death, doesn’t it?

---

## HASTINGS:
Sort of. You do know what I’m doing is highly irregular.

---

## BELLA: 
Yes, and you’re being a perfect duck.

---

## HASTINGS:
Are you absolutely certain you want to see?

---

## BELLA:
Show me the horrors.

---

## BELLA:
Oh! The poor man! His eyes are still open! Such a horrid shade of green. 

---

And that, is that the...?

---

## HASTINGS:
That is the murder weapon, yes. A letter opener.

---

## BELLA:
And it was used to open him. May I touch it?

---

## HASTINGS:
I’m not sure that would be proper. 

---

Strictly speaking, we shouldn’t be here at all without police supervis-

---


## INSPECTOR GIRAUD: 
(FROM OFF) Captain Hastings?

---

## BELLA:
Is that a policeman?

---

## HASTINGS:
Erm, let me -- 

---

## INSPECTOR GIRAUD:
(FROM OFF)
Captain Hastings!

---

## BELLA:
I don’t want to put you in Dutch. Thank you, Arthur.

---

## HASTINGS:
Hang on, where are you --

---

## BELLA:
I’m sure you’ll get your man!

---

## HASTINGS:
But will I see you again? I don’t even know your name!

---

## BELLA:
Arabella!

---

## POIROT:
Hastings?

---

## INSPECTOR GIRAUD:
Was someone with you just now? I could swear I heard a woman’s voice.

---

## HASTINGS:
No, I’m quite alone, as my solitary presence proves.

---

## POIROT:
Inspector Giraud has troubling news.

---

## INSPECTOR GIRAUD:
A second murder has been committed.

---

## HASTINGS:
A second murder?

---

## POIROT:
You will or will not be surprised to learn where it was discovered.

---

## INSPECTOR GIRAUD:
This man was found in the McQueen garden, in the border between the houses and the 16th green.

---

## POIROT:
The body was in the bushes next to a pile of lead pipe.

---

## INSPECTOR GIRAUD:
It is still not important.

---

## POIROT:
It is important.

---

## INSPECTOR GIRAUD:
Because?

---

## POIROT:
I do not know yet, but Poirot is always right so he can never be wrong!

---

## HASTINGS:
Erm, any idea who it is?

---

## INSPECTOR GIRAUD:
No identification, but the tailor’s markings on the suit say “Paul McQueen.” 

---

The victim was stabbed. No weapon found.



---

The wound was made with a blade like the one used to kill Monsieur McQueen.

---

La vache! But where is it?

---

## HASTINGS:
Where’s what?

---

## INSPECTOR GIRAUD:

The blade. Someone has taken the letter opener. I will see if one of my men is having it examined. 

---

Are you sure there was no one here with you?

---

## HASTINGS:
I was quite alone.

---

## INSPECTOR GIRAUD:
I believe you completely.

---



Touch nothing.

---

## POIROT:
Quickly, Hastings, the corpse, before the inspector returns.

---



Rigor mortis has come and gone, so he has been dead likely two days. 

---

Ruddy complexion, hands rough, dirt beneath the fingernails.

---

## HASTINGS:
A man who spent a good deal of time out of doors.

---

## POIROT:
Like a tramp.

---

## HASTINGS:
The fellow Martha saw in the garden with Paul McQueen!

---

## POIROT:
What else?

---

## HASTINGS:
There’s dried foam around his lips.

---

## POIROT:
Bloody foam?

---

## HASTINGS:
No blood.

---

## POIROT:
And around the wound?


---

## HASTINGS:
Also no blood.

---

## POIROT:
The man was stabbed after he was dead. A dead body does not bleed. 

---

And the foam is an indication of an epileptic fit.

---

## MRS. MCQUEEN:
I cannot help you. This tramp showed up two days ago, he wanted a hand out, 

---

we told him to leave, we never saw him again.

---

## POIROT:
And yet his body is today found in your garden, wearing your husband’s clothes.

---

## MRS. MCQUEEN:
Perhaps he stole Paul’s clothes. Perhaps he was the murderer.

---

## POIROT:
A perfectly reasonable deduction were it not for the fact he had been dead for at least 24 hours before your husband was killed.

---

## HASTINGS:
Someone stabbed a corpse.

---

## MRS. MCQUEEN:
So, then, who do you suspect?

---

## POIROT:
When a husband is murdered, it is sensible to suspect the wife. 

---

But someone did tie you up, those cuts on your wrists prove that. 

---

The one thing I cannot dismiss from my mind is the reaction you had to seeing your husband’s corpse.

---

## MRS. MCQUEEN:
It was shock.

---

## POIROT:
It was surprise. Your husband’s face was not the face you expected to see.

---

## MRS. MCQUEEN:
How dare you? How dare you?! You come in here, to my home and accuse me of..!

---

## POIROT:
Madame, vous ne devez pas vous agiter.

---

## MRS. MCQUEEN:
I will be as agitated as I please!

---

## JACK:
What’s going on? Are you giving my mother a hard time?

---

## POIROT:
Monsieur Jack --

---

## JACK:
Her husband’s been murdered, she’s a widow! 

---

Which, maybe if you’d done your job like you were supposed to, wouldn’t be --

---

## MRS. MCQUEEN:
Jack, please!

---

## JACK:
We’ve got enough police crawling over us already. That other one, the inspector, he’s here.

---

## MRS. MCQUEEN:
Does he want to see us?

---

## JACK:
You and me both.

---

## POIROT:
Go. We will make ourselves comfortable here in your husband’s study.

---

## HASTINGS:
What are you doing?

---

## POIROT:
Looking for something that makes sense of that note found in the overcoat worn by Paul McQueen.

---

"I love you. If I can't have you, no one will. B.D."

---


## HASTINGS:
Erm, Poirot, I feel a need to confess something to you. On the golf course today I, erm... I met a woman.

---

## POIROT:
How very fortunate for you.

---

## HASTINGS:
Yes, she’s staying here at the Hotel d’Angleterre. She’s beautiful, witty, she’s... she’s...

---

## POIROT:
A golfer?

---

## HASTINGS:
I know! The complete package!

---

## POIROT:
Mon dieu, Hastings, this is marvelous!

---

## HASTINGS:
Yes, well, then, when she found out I was helping you with the murder investigation, 

---

she immediately became interested and wanted me to show her the body and the evidence.

---

## POIROT:
Which you did not do, of course.

---

## HASTINGS:
I.. didn’t see much harm in it.

---

## POIROT:
Hastings
!

---

## HASTINGS:
She was very insistent! I took her to the morgue and showed her the body. 

---

When we heard Inspector Giraud’s voice, she scarpered. It was then the letter opener disappeared. 

---

I have a feeling she might have nicked it.

---

## POIROT:
Do you always take women you meet to places like that? Some would prefer first a cocktail.

---

## HASTINGS:
Everything in due time.

---

## POIROT:
This woman who likely stole the murder weapon, she is whom?

---

## HASTINGS:
She’s...

---



Her. The photo. That’s her. The woman I met.

---

## POIROT:
As you say, Hastings, trés belle.

---

## HASTINGS:
Trés.

---

## POIROT:
Did she tell you her name?

---

## HASTINGS:
Just her first name. Arabella.

---

## INSPECTOR GIRAUD:
Poirot?

---

## POIROT:
Inspector, have you had any luck finding the two Americans of whom Mrs. McQueen spoke?

---

## INSPECTOR GIRAUD:
If I had, then you would have been, if not the first, then perhaps the fifth to know. What are you doing here?

---

## POIROT:
I would ask you the same.

---

## INSPECTOR GIRAUD:
I am here on official police business.

---

## MRS. MCQUEEN:
What were you looking for in Paul’s desk?

---

## POIROT:
Evidence not discovered by the official police. 

---

This young lady’s photo was in your husband’s desk. Do either of you recognize her.

---

## MRS. MCQUEEN:
No.

---

## JACK:
No.

---

## POIROT:
Her first name is..?

---

## HASTINGS:
Arabella.

---

## JACK:
What if it is?

---

## POIROT:
Would you care to guess at her last name?

---

## JACK:
Why should I? I don’t know her.

---

## POIROT:
Hastings, will you call the Hotel d’Angleterre and ask them the last name of the woman Arabella who is registered there?

---

## JACK:
Don’t. It’s... Duveen.

---

## POIROT:
Arabella Duveen. Inspector, what was written on the note found in Paul McQueen’s overcoat?

---

## INSPECTOR GIRAUD:
“I love you. If I can’t have you, no one will.” B.D.

---

## POIROT:
Arabella Duveen. Bella Duveen. B.D. Was Miss Duveen having an affair with your husband?

---

## MRS. MCQUEEN:
With Paul?

---

## JACK:
That’s ridiculous!

---

## POIROT:
Is it?

---

## JACK:
It couldn’t be!

---

## POIROT:
But why not? Why could Bella Duveen not have been having an affair with your father?

---

## JACK:
Because she was having an affair with me!

---

## HASTINGS:
Bella
and you?

---

## POIROT:
That makes much more sense. This was a secret relationship?

---

## JACK:
Bella’s an actress. We’d been seeing each other every time her little troupe came through town. 

---

I kept it to myself because I didn’t think mother would approve, 

---

but I figured my father would get a kick out of it, so I gave him that photo to show him what she looks like.

---

## POIROT:
This was when?

---

## JACK:
Six, eight weeks ago.

---

## POIROT:
And the note?

---

## JACK:
Bella sent that to me after I broke things off with her.

---

## HASTINGS: 
Broke things off? When?

---



## POIROT:
Hastings, please. When?

---

## JACK:
Two days ago.

---


## HASTINGSPOIROT:
Because?

---

## JACK:
I met someone else. Martha, Comtesse DeLabegasssier’s companion. I’ve asked her to marry me.

---

## POIROT:
And does mother approve?

---

## MRS. MCQUEEN:
I do not. 

---

## POIROT:
But why?


---

## MRS. MCQUEEN:
The girl’s a servant. 

---

## JACK:
I told you I don’t want to hear any more of that!

---

## POIROT:
Actresses and servants, a mother’s tragedy. I take it this too was a secret relationship?

---

## JACK:
Not because of me. It was Martha who didn’t want anyone to know. She wanted to elope. 

---

But I had to tell Bella. Bella came here to the house. Father overheard us. 

---

He became furious, waving around that photo, saying how could I marry Martha, I’d be breaking Bella’s heart!

---

## POIROT:
And Bella Duveen, she was also furious.

---

## JACK:
Bella doesn’t accept no for an answer.

---

## POIROT:
Yes, Captain Hastings can attest to that. You say she sent you the note two days ago?

---

## JACK:
The day of father’s murder. It was in my overcoat when he ordered me to go to New York. 

---

I was so angry after our argument that when I left I must’ve grabbed the wrong coat. 

---

Didn’t realize it until I saw my own at --

---

## POIROT:
At the morgue, I did notice. You took your father’s coat, and he took yours.

---

## INSPECTOR GIRAUD:
You and your father argued the day he was murdered?

---

## JACK:
Yeah, we had a big damn row.

---

## INSPECTOR GIRAUD:
Which brings me to the official police business on which I have come. 

---

Do you know who benefits from your father’s estate?

---

## JACK:
His will leaves half to mother, half to me.

---

## INSPECTOR GIRAUD:
On the day of his death, your father changed his will, leaving everything to your mother.

---

## MRS. MCQUEEN:
That proves Jack had nothing to gain from Paul’s death.

---

## INSPECTOR GIRAUD:
Did you know your father had changed his will?

---

## JACK:
No.

What the hell was he doing?

---

## INSPECTOR GIRAUD:
So, on the night he was killed, you believed his death would make you very rich.

---

## MRS. MCQUEEN:
But Jack wasn’t even here when Paul was killed, he was in Cherbourg that night.

---

## INSPECTOR GIRAUD:
We have asked in Cherbourg at the train station and all the hotels. 

---

Your son was not in Cherbourg on the night of the murder as he did claim. 

---

Perhaps he can explain just where he was.

---

## JACK:
I stayed here in Merlinville that night.

---

## INSPECTOR GIRAUD:

Why?

---

## JACK:
..I’m not telling you.

---

## INSPECTOR GIRAUD:
You argued with your father, you thought you would inherit half of his estate, and you have no alibi for the time of his murder. 

---

Jack McQueen, I am arresting you pending the coroner’s inquest.

---

## MRS. MCQUEEN:
Jack, no, this isn’t... Jack!

---

## HASTINGS:
I can’t believe a boy like that would murder his own father.

---

## POIROT:
Unfortunately, he claims no alibi for the time of the murder.

---

## MARTHA:
But he does have an alibi.

---

## POIROT:
Mademoiselle Martha. Again you overhear and peek. You say your fiance Jack has an alibi?

---

## MARTHA:
Yes. Jack remained in Merlinville that night to see me.

---

## POIROT:
Where did he visit you?

---

## MARTHA:
At the Comtesse’s house.

---

## POIROT:
In which room did you meet?

---

## MARTHA:
..My bedroom.

---

## POIROT:
He came when?

---

## MARTHA:
At about nine o’clock.

---

## POIROT:
And left?

---

## MARTHA:
Seven the next morning, as the sun came up.

---

## POIROT:
So you did not stay with the Comtesse in her room all night.

---

## MARTHA:
No. I gave her an extra pill to make her sleep. She was dead to the world.

---

## POIROT:
Dead to the world, yes. Will you give the police a statement that you and Jack spent the night together?

---

## MARTHA:
I’ll go to the station now.

---

## HASTINGS:
Who are you calling?

---

## POIROT:
The police station, to make sure Martha and Jack do not speak to each other before the inquest. 

---

Hastings, go to the Hotel d’Angleterre! Find Bella Duveen.

---

## HASTINGS:
So, I went to the hotel, but Bella had checked out. The coroner’s inquest was that afternoon.

---

---

## HASTINGS:
Poirot, what have I missed?

---

## POIROT:
Nothing of importance, I have not yet spoken.

---

## INSPECTOR GIRAUD:
Monsieur le juge, we have received a sworn statement that must be read into the record.

---

## POIROT:
Pardonnez-moi, si le tribunal le permet, before reading aloud this statement, may I put a few questions to Monsieur Jack McQueen?

---

## INSPECTOR GIRAUD:

If you must.

---

## POIROT:
Monsieur McQueen, you have admitted you did remain here in Merlinville on the night of the murder. 

---

Do you know that Mademoiselle Martha has given the police a statement that says you stayed in order to see her?

---

## JACK:
..No.

---

## POIROT:
Is what she told the police true?

---

## JACK:
Erm, yes.

---

## POIROT:
Why did you do this?

---


## JACK:
I.. wanted to see Martha before I left for America.

---

## POIROT:
Where did you meet with her?

---

## JACK:
At the Comtesse’s house.

---

## POIROT:
Where at the Comtesse’s house?

---

## JACK:
..In the garden.

---

## POIROT:
And when did you leave?

---

## JACK:
Around 4:00 am, it was still dark.

---

## POIROT:
Inspector, do Monsieur McQueen’s answers match Mademoiselle Martha’s statement?

---

## INSPECTOR GIRAUD:
They do not.

---

## JACK:
Oh.

---

## POIROT:
All yours, inspector.

---

## INSPECTOR GIRAUD:

I ask that the court remand Jack McQueen for trial.

---

## POIROT:
Hastings, the smelling salts, she has again fainted.

---

## MARTHA:
Why did you do that?

---

## POIROT:
Because you lied, clumsily, to give Jack an alibi.

---

## MARTHA:
And you just made sure that he’s put on trial for murder!

---

## POIROT:
I would not be so certain of that.

---

## BELLA:
You are Monsieur Poirot?

---

## POIROT:
Oui, mademoiselle, and you are, I believe...

---

## JACKHASTINGS:
Bella.

---

## BELLA:
I can’t let this go on.

---



Your honor, my name is Bella Duveen. I wish to give myself up. 

---

I killed Paul McQueen.

---

## JACK:
Bella--

---

## INSPECTOR GIRAUD:
In light of this confession, I fear I must release Jack McQueen and arrest Bella Duveen for murder.

---

## JACK:
Hey, take your hands off her!

---

## INSPECTOR GIRAUD:
Eloignez-vous, Monsieur!

---

## JACK:
I said take your goddamn hands off her!

---

## HASTINGS:
Bella, you can’t be the murderer, I don’t believe it!

---

## BELLA:
I’m sorry, Arthur.

---

## HASTINGS:
Poirot, you’ve got to do something.

---

## POIROT:
But why? The woman confessed, the mystery is over. 

---

## HASTINGS: 
Damn you, Poirot, can’t you see she’s innocent?

---

## JACK:
Mr. Poirot?

---

## POIROT:
Yes?

---

## JACK:
I’ve got to see about my mother.

---

## POIROT:
Bella Duveen must love Jack very much to want to kill him and to save him.

---

## MARTHA:
He’s worth it.

---

## HASTINGS:
That girl’s a wonder. Martha has every right to be jealous, yet there’s not a flicker of the “green-eyed monster.”

---

## POIROT:
Mon dieu! Poirot, tu es un idiot! I deserve to be kicked from here to the Folies Bergère!

---

## HASTINGS:
What are you on about, Poirot?

---

## POIROT:
Green eyes! Anxious eyes! The missing piece of the puzzle has been staring at me in the face!

---

## HASTINGS:
Where are you going?

---

## POIROT:
First, to the telegraph office, to send a cable to London. Then, I must, as you golfers say, sink a hole in one.

---

---

## POIROT:
So. You are the killer of Paul McQueen.

---

## BELLA:
Yes.

---

## POIROT:
Because?

---

## BELLA:
I thought he was Jack.

---

## POIROT:
Ah, you wanted to kill Jack!

---

## BELLA:
You read the note I sent. “If I can’t have you, no one will.” 

---

In the dark, I mistook Mr. McQueen for Jack and I stabbed him.

---

## POIROT:
With this letter opener.

---

## BELLA:
Yes.

---

## POIROT:
A letter opener that belonged to Mrs. McQueen and was kept on her dressing table.

---

## BELLA:
Mrs. McQueen’s dressing --?

---

## POIROT:
And after you killed him, you forgot to take the letter opener with you 

---

but then remembered you forgot and tricked Captain Hastings into taking you to the morgue so you could take it back.

---

## BELLA:
Yes.

---

## POIROT:
Because?

---

## BELLA:
I was afraid my fingerprints were on it.

---

## POIROT:
There were no fingerprints on it.

---

## BELLA:
No finger --?

---

## POIROT:
Did you wear gloves?

---

## BELLA:
I  didn’t--

---

## POIROT:
Did you wipe the handle after you killed him?

---

## BELLA:
It was --

---

## POIROT:
Perhaps you removed your fingerprints by erasing them with sandpaper and acid.

---

## BELLA:
Stop it!

---

## POIROT:
You didn’t kill Paul McQueen. 

---

You thought Jack killed him, that Jack’s fingerprints would be on the letter opener, so you took it to protect him. 

---

But Jack was arrested anyway, and the only thing you could think to save him was to make a false confession.

---

## BELLA:
Jack was in such a state that night I thought he could’ve done anything. ..I’ve made a hash of things, haven’t I?

---

## POIROT:
You have a changeable personality.

---

## BELLA:
Does this mean I’m not under arrest?

---

## POIROT:
No, you are under arrest, for making the hash. And for what you did to my Hastings.

---

## BELLA:
Poor Arthur, he’s the sort of man  a ..

---

## POIROT:
Please. I blush easily. 

---

## BELLA:
What are you going to do?

---

## POIROT:
Gather the suspects together. And prove that Sherlock Holmes was right.

---

---

## COMTESSE DELABEGASSIER:
Monsieur Poirot, I understand your guests are arriving.

---

## POIROT:
Yes, I hope you don’t mind our using your lovely villa for this gathering.

---

## COMTESSE DELABEGASSIER:
No, no, this is the most excitement Martha and I have had in years.

---

## JACK:
Well. This is a strange sort of party.

---

## MRS. MCQUEEN:
Yes, what are we doing here? I thought Bella Duveen had been arrested for Paul’s murder.

---

## INSPECTOR GIRAUD:

She was.

---

## POIROT:
But the case is not yet closed.

---

## MRS. MCQUEEN:
But she confessed to --

---

## INSPECTOR GIRAUD:
Oh, now, this is too much!

---

## POIROT:
Yes, yes, and there is an explanation, is there not, Monsieur Jack? 

---

At the inquest you wanted to say something to me. If you wish a second chance, now would be the time.

---

## JACK:
Bella couldn’t have killed my father.

---

## INSPECTOR GIRAUD:
Why not?

---

## JACK:
Because on the night he was murdered, I didn’t stay in Merlinville to see Martha, 

---

I stayed to see Bella. I wanted to talk to her, to try to explain. 

---

I ended up spending the night with her at the Hotel d’Angleterre, until morning.

---

## HASTINGS:
Oh.

---

## POIROT:
And the reason you did not tell this before?

---

## JACK:
I didn’t want to hurt Martha. Martha, I’m so sorry.

---

## MARTHA:
I understand, Jack. She meant quite a lot to you, once.

---

## INSPECTOR GIRAUD:
But if Bella and Jack were together, why did she not say that instead of confessing to a murder she did not commit?

---

## POIROT:
Bella knew that if she said Jack spent the night with her, it would hurt him in the eyes of his fiancee. 

---

Instead, Bella, so to speak, fell on her letter opener. She is a very special woman.

---

## HASTINGSJACK:
Yes.

---

## POIROT:
So, Jack is Bella’s alibi, and Bella is Jack’s alibi. Just as Martha was Jack’s alibi, albeit briefly. 

---

So many clever people trying to out-clever each other.

---

## COMTESSE DELABEGASSIER:
Does this mean you are back where you started?

---

## POIROT:
No, Comtesse, where we are is at the denouement. How many of you here read murder mysteries?

---

## POIROT:
Do any of you recall a Sherlock Holmes story titled “The Case of the Anxious Eyes”?

---

## HASTINGS:
It’s not one of his better known ones.

---

## POIROT:
Because it was a failure. It was called the Berenger Case. 

---

I re-read it just today at the Merlinville library. 

---

The Berenger Case is identical to the McQueen case in almost every way. 

---

At the end of Dr. Watson’s story, a man named Georges Conneau is wanted for the murder of Arnold Berenger and flees France with a beautiful young maid. 

---

But Holmes says that one day, “a lamp will be shone on the case,” revealing George Conneau to have been “an honest man.”

---

## HASTINGS:
I remember now. Odd turn of phrase.

---

## POIROT:
But suggestive, non? Who was it in search of an honest man?

---

## COMTESSE DELABEGASSIER:
Diogenes.

---

## POIROT:
Brava! Diogenes searched for an honest man. 

---

Today, I sent a telegram to the Diogenes Club in London, 

---

inquiring if the club had a member named Georges Conneau, known perhaps as ‘an honest man.’ 

---

One hour ago, I received a reply: a package delivered to me by special air courier with this note...

---

## MYCROFT HOLMES (VO): 
“Dear Mr. Poirot, The Diogenes Club is not surprised to learn that the “Georges Conneau” affair has, 

---

as brother Sherlock predicted, ‘come alive again.’ 

---

Herewith, enclosed are all the relevant documents in the case. 

---

The Diogenes Club wishes you good hunting.’ Your servant, Mycroft Holmes.”

---

## POIROT:
In the package was a dossier containing an account of the Berenger case written not by Dr. Watson - but by Sherlock Holmes! 

---

With newsclippings, trial transcripts, photographs.

---

## INSPECTOR GIRAUD:
You think that case is connected to Paul McQueen’s murder?

---

## POIROT:
Man is an unoriginal animal. If a man commits a crime, any other crime he commits will resemble it. 

---

The mind behind the murder of Paul McQueen was the same mind behind the murder of Arnold Berenger.

---

## INSPECTOR GIRAUD:
Are you saying Georges Conneau killed Paul McQueen?

---

## POIROT:
In a sense, yes. Mrs. McQueen, quel est votre prenom?

---

## MRS. MCQUEEN:
..What?

---

## POIROT:
I know you understand French, you understood when I told you in French not to become agitated. 

---

What is your Christian name?

---

## MRS. MCQUEEN:
...Eloise.

---

## POIROT:
I ask merely for confirmation, because I am certain that your husband Paul McQueen was in fact…

---

## POIROT:
..Georges Conneau, who escaped from France with a maid named Eloise...

---

## POIROT:
...changed their names to McQueen, made a fortune in America, and had a son named Jack.

---

## POIROT:
25 years later they come back to France, to Merlinville-surMer. When who moves in next door...

---

## PAUL MCQUEEN:
Lily Berenger.

---

## COMTESSE DELABEGASSIER:
Hello, Georges. Or should I call you Paul McQueen? 

---

If I call you Georges Conneau, you’ll be arrested for murder and lose everything: your wealth, your wife, your son, your head. 

---

The guillotine is still comme il faut, is it not? A short, sharp shock?

---

## PAUL MCQUEEN:
What do you want?

---

## COMTESSE DELABEGASSIER:
Money. A lot of it.

---

## PAUL MCQUEEN:
I thought you inherited the Berenger fortune.

---

## COMTESSE DELABEGASSIER:
No. I gave birth to a girl. All that for nothing.

---

## POIROT:
When her daughter was born, Lily Berenger abandoned the child at an orphanage, then continued her life of crime. 

---

It is called the confidence game. Tricking people out of money, men mostly.

---

## COMTESSE DELABEGASSIER:
Oh. I dropped my handkerchief.

---

## POIROT:
She changes her appearance, her hair, her name.

---

## COMTESSE DELABEGASSIER:
The Baroness Orzcy.
Dulcie O’Hara.
The Comtesse Delabegassier.

---

## POIROT:
But then: catastrophe! The Balvano Railway crash. Lily Beranger was badly injured.

---

## POIROT:
Now she needed help to ply her trade. So, she returned to the orphanage.

---

## COMTESSE DELABEGASSIER:
I want to adopt a girl. I’m sure she’s still here.

---

## MARTHA:
Thank you for adopting me.

---

## COMTESSE DELABEGASSIER:
I can always bring you back.

---

## POIROT:
They travel the continent, doing what they do.

---

## MARTHA:
Oh. I dropped my doll.

---

## POIROT:
The little girl grows up.

---

## MARTHA:
I dropped my parasol.

---

## POIROT:
She becomes a woman.

---

## MARTHA:
I dropped my cocktail.

---

## POIROT:
For ten years, Lily does not tell Martha that she is her daughter. 

---

And then they arrived at Merlinville.

---

## PAUL MCQUEEN:
A daughter.

---



Does she have your lips, your smile?

---

## COMTESSE DELABEGASSIER:
She has your eyes. They’re watching us from the villa. 

---

## MARTHA:
Who was that you were talking to?

---


## COMTESSE DELABEGASSIER:
A very rich man. Now go seduce his son.

---

## JACK:
Jack McQueen.

---

## MARTHA:
Martha. I don’t have a last name.

---

## POIROT:
Martha has done this before. But this time is different.

---

## MARTHA:
I love you, Jack.

---

## JACK:
Marry me, Martha. We’ll tell father and mother and the Comtesse at once.

---

## MARTHA:
No! I don’t want the Comtesse to find out, not yet. Let’s elope. Please?

---

## POIROT:
Martha wants to keep the engagement a secret, but Jack tells Bella, and his father finds out.

---

## MRS. MCQUEEN:
Jack can’t marry Martha, you know why he can’t! 

---

If we don’t do something, she and Lily will have a hold over us for the rest of our lives!

---

## PAUL MCQUEEN:
Shhh! I’ll come up with a plan.

---

## POIROT:
And then fate enters. A man, a tramp, comes into the McQueen’s garden and dies of an epileptic fit. 

---

There in that garden, Paul comes up with his plan.

---

## PAUL MCQUEEN:
The only way to get free of their clutches is if I’m dead.

---

## MRS. MCQUEEN:
Dead? No, you can’t!

---

## PAUL MCQUEEN:
Eloise, hear me out! I won’t die. This poor man will play my corpse. 

---

I’ll stab him with that letter opener of yours, and then...

---

## MRS. MCQUEEN:
But he doesn’t look like you!

---

## PAUL MCQUEEN:
And then I’ll disfigure his face! I’ll beat it to a pulp with a piece of pipe from the garden.

---

## POIROT:
Leadpipe.

---

## PAUL MCQUEEN:
When they show you the body, you’ll identify him as me. 

---

You’ll say I was killed by .. by a pair of Americans with an old vendetta.

---

## MRS. MCQUEEN:
Where will you go?

---

## PAUL MCQUEEN:
I’ll slip away over the golf course and stowaway on a ship to New York. 

---

I’ll send Jack there ahead of me. In a month or so, you’ll join us.

---

## MRS. MCQUEEN:
What if Martha goes after him?

---

## PAUL MCQUEEN:
I’ll change my will, leaving everything to you. If Jack doesn’t inherit anything, Martha will give up the chase.

---

## MRS. MCQUEEN:
When do we do this?

---

## PAUL MCQUEEN:
Tomorrow. Midnight.

---

## POIROT:
Paul McQueen writes to a detective to ask for help, knowing that when the letter is read by the police it will color the investigation.

---

## INSPECTOR GIRAUD:
“I am convinced that men from my past wish my immediate and violent death.”

---

## POIROT:
On the last day of his life, Paul McQueen orders his son Jack to make a sudden business trip.

---

## JACK:
New York? For Christ’s sake --

---

## PAUL MCQUEEN:
Don’t argue with me, Jack, just do as you’re told!

---

## POIROT:
He changes his will. That night, at midnight he switches his good suit with the tramp's poor one.

---

He dons his son's overcoat.

---


## POIROT:
He ties up his wife Eloise, correcting the mistake he made when he tied up Lily Berenger 25 years before.

---

## MRS. MCQUEEN:
Must it be so tight, it hurts!

---

## PAUL MCQUEEN:
I’m sorry, but it’s got to look right.

---

## POIROT:
He goes to the garden. He stabs the corpse with the letter opener. 

---

He gets a length of pipe and is about to disfigure the tramp’s face when something stops him. 

---

A shadow on the 16th green. He goes to investigate...

---

## PAUL MCQUEEN:
What are you doing out here?

---

## POIROT:
And sees his murderer, waiting for him.

---

## PAUL MCQUEEN:
Aggh!!

---

## POIROT:
He collapses to the 16th green, and the lead pipe falls next to his body.

---

## MRS. MCQUEEN:
But who could have known Paul would be there? We didn’t tell anyone.

---

## POIROT:
Nevertheless, your plans were known.

---

## COMTESSE DELABEGASSIER:
How absolutely mesmerizing. Of course, it’s all a delusional fantasy. You have no proof.

---

## POIROT:
Proof?

---

## COMTESSE DELABEGASSIER:
I assume you’re accusing me of murdering Paul.

---

## POIROT:
Mais, no. You could not have murdered Paul McQueen. You are in that chair. 

---

No, everyone here has an alibi. You were in your room, mort au monde, dead to the world. 

---

Bella was with Jack, Jack was with Bella, Mrs. McQueen was tied up. Everyone except...

---

## MARTHA:
Why are you looking at me?

---

## POIROT:
You did have an alibi, briefly, when you lied about Jack spending the night with you. 

---

But that was not to give Jack an alibi, it was to give you an alibi.

---

## MARTHA:
What? No.

---

## POIROT:
For years you had dreamed of escaping this woman who raised you to be a criminal, who made you do unspeakable things.

---



Then Jack McQueen asks you to marry him. At last your dream is about to come true. 

---

And then, while she is taking her nap in the bedroom that overlooks the McQueen’s garden, you overhear:

---

## MRS. MCQUEEN:
Jack can’t marry Martha, you know why he can’t.

---

## POIROT:
What are they talking about? Your mother has never told you the truth. 

---

But you have overheard Paul McQueen make his plan of escape, so when Paul goes out that night...

---

## MARTHA:
Mr. McQueen?

---

## PAUL MCQUEEN:
What are you doing out here?

---

## MARTHA:
I..I heard you and your wife talking in the garden. Why can’t Jack marry me? 

---

I’d make him a good wife, I know I would.

---

## PAUL MCQUEEN:
Did Lily send you here to say this?

---

## MARTHA:
Who’s Lily?

---

## PAUL MCQUEEN:
Please. The “Comtesse.”

---

## MARTHA:
I don’t know what you’re talking about.

---

## PAUL MCQUEEN:
You can’t be..! ..Are you saying you really don’t know?

---

## MARTHA:
Mr. McQueen, tell me what I can do to make things right! I don’t want Jack’s money or your money, I love Jack!

---

## PAUL MCQUEEN:
No! You.. you stay away from Jack!

---

## MARTHA:
Mr. McQueen, please --

---

## PAUL MCQUEEN:
I’m telling you: you can’t marry my son!

---

## MARTHA:
But I don’t understand why!

---

## PAUL MCQUEEN:
Because you’re my daughter! Lily’s and mine.

---

## MARTHA:
..You’re lying. It’s not the truth.

---

## PAUL MCQUEEN:
It is. That’s why you can never see Jack again. I can’t let my son be destroyed.

---

## MARTHA:
Your son be destroyed? What about your daughter?

---

## PAUL MCQUEEN:
I didn’t know anything about you!

---

## MARTHA:
You abandoned me to that woman!

---

## PAUL MCQUEEN:
As far as I was concerned you didn’t exist! 

---

Aggh!

---


## MARTHA:
How can you think that of me?

---

## POIROT:
Like mother, like daughter.

---

## MARTHA:
No. I’m not like her.

---

## POIROT:
You killed Paul McQueen.

---

## MARTHA:
I didn’t!

---

## POIROT:
You are the only person who could have done so. Unless your mother can give you an alibi for the time of the murder. 

---

## MARTHA: 
But she can! It wasn’t like I said, I was in her bedroom with her, all night, she knows that, she saw me! 

---

Tell them, Comtesse - Mother? - Help me!

---

## COMTESSE DELABEGASSIER:
I was asleep. Dead to the world.

---

## MARTHA:
No!

---

## COMTESSE DELABEGASSIER:
You were going to marry Jack and didn’t tell me?! You tried to cut me out of all that money!

---

## MARTHA:
It wasn’t about the money!

---

## COMTESSE DELABEGASSIER:
Oh ho ho!

---

## MARTHA:
You sent me to seduce my own brother!

---

## COMTESSE DELABEGASSIER:
You stupid, stupid girl! Everything I wanted you took away from me! You ruined my life!

---

## MARTHA:
I killed my own father! You ruined my life

---

## JACK:
Martha! Martha --!

---

## POIROT:
She will not get far. The villa, it is surrounded by gendarmes.

---

## MRS. MCQUEEN:
You monster!

---

## COMTESSE DELABEGASSIER:
Oh, Eloise, stop. Always so emotional.

---



When she was my maid, she’d cry over Georges so much her tears got in the tea. 

---

As I said, an entertaining evening, but if there’s nothing more…

---

## POIROT:
There is. You did not murder Paul McQueen, but you won’t escape justice for the murder of Arnold Berenger.

---

## COMTESSE DELABEGASSIER:
How do you expect to pull that out of a hat?

---

## POIROT:
With a piece of evidence which I think is just about to make an appearance.

---

## INSPECTOR GIRAUD:
She didn’t run away, she went up to the Comtesse’s room!

---

## COMTESSE DELABEGASSIER:
Martha, what are you doing?

---

## MARTHA:
She keeps this with her always. She calls it her Crown Jewels.

---

## COMTESSE DELABEGASSIER:
Martha! Martha, no! Please!

---

## POIROT:
A blade. A scalpel. And the one thing you did not consider 25 years ago: fingerprints.

---

## COMTESSE DELABEGASSIER:
Fingerprints?

---

## POIROT:
No one thought about fingerprints then. We do now.

---

## COMTESSE DELABEGASSIER:
You tricky little Belgian fop. If I were younger I’d melt your mustache wax. 

---

You think you have me? I deny everything. If there are fingerprints on that scalpel, they’re not mine. 

---

Those fingerprints and that scalpel belong to Dr. John Watson. I...

---

## POIROT:
Just so, madame. But how could you know this scalpel is John Watson’s?

---

## COMTESSE DELABEGASSIER:
I...you --

---

## POIROT:
I never said so. You have just incriminated yourself.

---

## COMTESSE DELABEGASSIER:
Go ahead, arrest me. I ran rings round a jury before, I can do it again.

---

## MARTHA:
No. You won’t.

---


## OTHERS: 
No! - The blade! - Stop her! - Mon dieu! - Martha, no!

---

## INSPECTOR GIRAUD:
Elle est morte.

---

## MARTHA:
Escape at last.

---

## INSPECTOR GIRAUD:
Mademoiselle, you are under arrest for murder.

---

## MARTHA:
Merci, monsieur. Allow me to drive.

---

## INSPECTOR GIRAUD:
Captain Hastings? I will see you on the golf course.

---

## JACK:
We’re in your debt, Monsieur Poirot.

---

## MRS. MCQUEEN:
How can we repay you?

---

## POIROT:
A check will do.

---

## HASTINGS:
How in heaven’s name did you know Martha was George Conneau’s daughter?

---

## POIROT:
It was you gave me the clue when you said the line from Shakespeare: “The green eyed monster.” 

---

Very much like what Sherlock Holmes wrote: “The eyes have it.” 

---

Martha’s eyes are green just as George Conneau’s were green.

---

## HASTINGS:
And you know Georges Conneau’s eyes were green because...?

---

## POIROT:
From Dr. Watson’s story. Lily Berenger testified, quote: 

---

“Georges’ green, glowing eyes were filled with jealous madness!” 

---

Even in death, as the late Paul McQueen, his eyes were green, 

---

a color that only occurs if the parents pass down the correct genetic code.

---

## HASTINGS:
Genetic code?

---

## POIROT:
The science of biological inheritance. It has completely transformed the field.

---

## HASTINGS:
Ah. What’s going to happen to Bella now?

---

## POIROT:
Oh, she has been released, I saw to that.

---

## HASTINGS:
Thank God. I want to take her away from all this intrigue, give her a breath of fresh air. 

---

She and I have a true sympathy and common sensibility that --

---

## HASTINGS:
Bella! I’m so glad you’re free. There’s something extremely important I need to say to you.

---

## BELLA:
Me as well.

---

## HASTINGS:
You go first. Mine can wait.

---

## BELLA:
I think I need a change. Start afresh in some undiscovered country. With someone I care for a great deal.

---

## HASTINGS:
Yes! Yes!

---

## JACK:
Bella, I brought the car around.

---

## BELLA:
In a moment, Jack. Captain Hastings... Arthur... I owe you my life. Well, what was yours?

---

## HASTINGS:
Hmm, what?

---

## BELLA:
The “extremely important” thing you needed to say to me!

---

## HASTINGS:
Oh. I... I’ve... ordered a new set of clubs. Golf clubs.

---

## BELLA:
Really! You sounded as if you were going to tell me you’d fallen in love!

---

## HASTINGS:
Only with my mashie niblick!

---

## BELLA:
You are a dear! Goodbye.

---

## POIROT:
Au revoir, mademoiselle.

---

## POIROT:
Hastings
...

---

## HASTINGS:
So, erm, Poirot, in Holmes’ dossier...

---

## POIROT:
Yes, the dossier, we must keep safe. But for you, Hastings, I give this: the original manuscript of Dr. Watson’s story. 

---

You see the title there?

---

## HASTINGS:
“The Case of the Anxious Eyes.”

---

## POIROT:
The very thing you said when we first met poor Martha.

---

## HASTINGS:
Was it? Curious what one notices about a woman and what one doesn’t.

---

## POIROT:
When I heard those words, I knew it was a clue to follow. Which is what we shall tell them when we arrive in Sussex where a certain retired detective keeps his bees.

---

## HASTINGS:
A bee-keeping detective?

---

## POIROT:
One almost as great as myself. Sherlock Holmes.
