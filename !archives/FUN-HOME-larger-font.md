## BRUCE:
Hey, gimme a hand.


## ALISON:
Right, right, right.

---

## SMALL ALISON:
What’d’ja get, Daddy?

---

## BRUCE:
It’s from Clyde Gibbon’s barn. What a haul. He said, “Take what you want,” and I said, “You sure, Clyde?” 

---

He said, “It’s all junk to me,” so I said, “Alright, Clyde, alright.” 

---

Come here. Look. You go to auctions, yard sales, comb the dump and crap, there’s crap, there’s crap, there’s – 

---

Ah! What’s this?

---

## SMALL ALISON:
More crap?

---

## BRUCE:
No – 

---

LINEN

THIS IS… LINEN

---

GORGEOUS IRISH LINEN<br>
SEE HOW I CAN TELL?

---

RIGHT HERE, THIS FLOATING THREAD, YOU SEE?<br>
THAT’S WHAT MAKES IT DAMASK

---

AND THE WEIGHT, THE WEIGHT, THIS DRAPE<br>
AND THE PATTERN, CRISP AND CLEAR

---

SEE HOW IT’S MADE FROM MATTE AND SHINE<br>
IT’S TATTERED HERE, BUT ALL THE REST – 

---

HOW BEAUTIFUL<br>
HOW FINE

---

Okay, okay… What else?

Crap… Crap...

---

Dead mouse.

---

## SMALL ALISON:
Ooh, can I have it?

---

## BRUCE:
It’s all yours.

---

What’s this?

---

SILVER

IS THIS… SILVER?

---

IS THIS JUNK OR SILVER?<br>
WITH POLISH WE CAN TELL

---

I LOVE HOW TARNISH MELTS AWAY<br>
OPENING TO LUSTER

---


AND THE MARK, IS THERE A MARK?<br>
YES, THIS STAMP, YOU SEE RIGHT HERE?

---


THAT’S HOW THE CRAFTSMAN LEAVES A SIGN

THAT HE WAS HERE AND MADE HIS WORK 

---

SO BEAUTIFUL, SO FINE

---



THIS HAS TRAVELED CONTINENTS TO GET HERE<br>
AND CROSSED AN OCEAN OF TIME

---

AND SOMEHOW LANDED IN THIS BOX UNDER A LAYER OF GRIME

---

I CAN’T ABIDE ROMANTIC NOTIONS OF SOME VAGUE “LONG AGO”

---


I WANT TO KNOW WHAT’S TRUE,

DIG DEEP INTO WHO

---


AND WHAT AND WHY AND WHEN,<br>
UNTIL NOW GIVES WAY TO THEN

---

## ALISON:
Did you ever imagine *I’d* hang onto your stuff, Dad? Me neither. 

---

But I guess I always knew that someday I was going to draw you. In cartoons. 

---

Yes, Dad, I know you think cartoons are silly, but I draw cartoons. 

---

And I need real things to draw from because I don’t trust memory.

---

BUT GOD, THIS THING IS GHASTLY!<br>
YOU WERE SO ECSTATIC WHEN YOU FOUND IT AT A YARD SALE

---


NO, NO, WAIT – <br>
IN MR. GIBBONS BARN

---


IT ALL COMES BACK, IT ALL COMES BACK, IT ALL COMES BACK<br>
THERE’S YOU AND THERE’S ME

---


BUT NOW I’M THE ONE WHO’S FORTY-THREE AND STUCK<br>
I CAN’T FIND MY WAY THROUGH

---

JUST LIKE YOU<br>
AM I JUST LIKE YOU?

## BRUCE:
I just got a call from Eleanor Bochner! Allegheny Historical Society! She was calling about the house tour!

---

## HELEN:
Oh, that’s wonderful!

---

## BRUCE:
She’s on her way over right now. I’m not sure what to do. This place is turned upside-down… I’m not even dressed—

---

## HELEN:
Go take a shower.

---

## BRUCE:
But—

---

## HELEN:
Take a shower, get yourself dressed.

---

## HELEN:
Kids. An important lady is on her way over here to see the house – listen to me, please. 

---

This is one of those times you need to do what I say quickly and without any shenanigans.

## BRUCE: 
Thank you. Obviously still a work in progress.

Oh yes, I’ve done all the work myself. That’s how we’re able to afford the place. 

---

No, no, historic restoration is an avocation, but that’s very flattering.

I teach English at Beech Creek High, and the Bechdel Funeral Home is our family business.

[PHONE RINGS]

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
Hello?

---

## BRUCE:
Yes, I’d like to speak to Alison Bechdel, the college student?

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
Hi Dad.

---

## BRUCE:
So? How’s it going? How are your classes? How’s your dorm? How’s the food?

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
I’m… getting used to it.

---

## BRUCE:
A little homesick?

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
No, it’s not that, it’s just… stupid stuff. 

---

In Modern Classics yesterday the professor said that Jakes’s renewal in Spain in “The Sun Also Rises” is really an allusion to *Jungian rebirth.*

---

## BRUCE:
What???

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
I almost screamed, “That's bullshit!”

---

## BRUCE:
That’s bullshit! Jakes’ not a *symbol,* he’s Hemingway! That book is a roman-a-clef.

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
I know! And at dining yesterday I mentioned that my family runs a funeral home 

---

and everyone dropped their forks and stared at me like I was Norman Bates.

---

## BRUCE:
Typical.

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
I probably just have to find the right people. There must be some people here who aren’t total idiots.

---

## BRUCE:
Or maybe not. 

---

One surprising thing you learn when you go away to college: people just aren’t as smart as you want them to be. 

---

Trust your instincts, kid. You don’t need to twist yourself in knots trying to impress people who are Not Worthy Of You. Got it?

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
Got it. Thanks, Dad.

---

## BRUCE:
Good. Alright, I gotta get over to the Fun Home, I’ve got a viewing in 45 minutes.

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
Who died?

---

## BRUCE:
One of that big clan of Hofbruners over in Lakeview.

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
Ah. Have fun.

---

## BRUCE:
Will do. Hey kiddo – Remember what I said, okay?

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
I will, Dad. Thanks.

---

## ALISON:
September 15th. 

---


Just had a good talk with Dad and I feel so much better. (Underline, underline, underline.) 

---

I’m going to spend four years reading books and drawing. And that’s *fine.* 

---

I don’t know where I got this insane idea I needed to throw myself out into the world.

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
It’s not the world anyway! It’s Oberlin College!

---

## ALISON:
[LAUGHING] Woah, I had no idea what was coming.

---


---

## BRUCE:
So sorry, the kids must have been cleaning in here. This is the one we spoke about. Cherry. Quite popular.

---

## PETE:
Alright.

---

## BRUCE:
Why don’t we take these brochures into the office where you can think it over.

---

## PETE:
So you say we won’t see any of the bruises? With the IVs she was awful beat up by the end.

---

## BRUCE:
No, we remove all signs of trauma. Don’t worry, Pete. She’ll look very peaceful.

---

## PETE:
Thank you. Thanks, Bruce.

---

## BRUCE:
Of course. Let’s—

---

## PETE:
No, no, I’ll take these home.

---

## BRUCE:
Sounds good. Take a look and give me a call later. Get some rest, Pete.

---

## PETE:
Thanks, Bruce.

---


---

## BRUCE:
Kids, get out of there. 

---

NOW! 

---

Where’s John? 

---

How many times have you been told Do Not Get In the Caskets?

---

## JOHN:
We were making a commercial for-

---

## SMALL ALISON:
Shhh!!

---

## CHRISTIAN:
We’re sorry, Dad.

---

## BRUCE:
We’ve got two bodies. We’ve got work to do.

---

## SMALL ALISON:
My turn to do the directory! Who are they?

---

## BRUCE:
Muriel Swartz. Dwight Johnson.

---

## SMALL ALISON:
Wait – Benny’s dad?

---

## CHRISTIAN:
Benny’s in my class!

---

## SMALL ALISON:
What happened?

---

## BRUCE:
He fell off a ladder. Broke his neck. Get this cleaned up. It’s going to be a long night.

---

## CHRISTIAN:
When you break your neck is it just like *crack* you’re instantly dead?

---

## JOHN:
Probably his head was hanging from his neck and then he couldn’t see 

---

and then he couldn’t eat or anything and then he died from not eating and running into things. 

---

## CHRISTIAN:
That’s not right.

---

## SMALL ALISON:
You guys, we gotta practice for the commercial.

---

## JOHN:
Yeah, we messed it up before.

---

## SMALL ALISON:
Give it to me.

---

## JOHN:
I want it.

---

## CHRISTIAN:
My turn!

---

## SMALL ALISON:
Shhh!

---


---

## CHRISTIAN:
Should we start at the top?

---

## SMALL ALISON:
Yeah.

---

## CHRISTIAN:
Hold on, should we say Fun Home? We only call it that in the family.

---

## JOHN:
Yeah, that’s right.

---

## SMALL ALISON:
It’s our commercial. We can do what we want.

---

## JOHN:
That’s right too.

---

## CHRISTIAN:
I guess.

---

## SMALL ALISON:
Come on!

---

## CHRISTIAN:
Okay, okay!

Why?

I don’t know.

Alison!

Hand me those scissors on the tray.

## SMALL ALISON:
Is that all?

What? 

Oh, yeah.

---


---

## ALISON:
“Dad showed me a dead body today

---

Went swimming

---

Got a new Hardy Boy book

---

Had egg salad for lunch”

---



What was that about, Dad? Why did you call me back there? 

---

Is that the way your father showed you your first dead body? Was it some Bechdel rite of passage? 

---

Or, am I reading too much into this? Maybe you just needed the scissors.


---


---

## JOAN:
Hey.

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
What? Oh. Hey.

Hey, you look like a guy I met the other day. Are you that same guy?

I remember what he looked like upside down. Raaahr!

## HELEN:
Hello. I’m Helen Bechdel.

---

## ROY:
Ah, Mrs. Bechdel, yeah, I’m Roy—sorry, I know who you are, my aunt and uncle talk about you all the time, 

---

they see your plays, they’re crazy about you. They’re always saying you’re so much better than Irma Hornbacher.

---

## HELEN:
Oh. No, Irma’s wonderful.

---

## BRUCE:
Come one, you’re in a different class! I’ve seen a lot of New York theater, even by those standards she’s exceptional.

---

## SMALL ALISON:
Our mom’s in a play called Mrs. Warner and the Professor!

---

## HELEN:
Mrs. Warren’s Profession.

---

## SMALL ALISON:
She studied in New York with Uta Hagen. Do you know who that is?

---

I don’t even know what you just said.

Wanna get started?

Sure. Whatever you want. Lemme get my tools.

Herbie is a car!

## ROY:
I didn’t see it.

---

## JOHN:
The love bug? You didn’t see the love bug?

---

## HELEN:
Who is that? Why is he here?

---

## BRUCE:
I hired him.

---

## HELEN:
To do what?

---

## BRUCE:
To help me out.

---

## HELEN:
Where is he from?

---

## BRUCE:
When we went to the lumberyard last week he was there working for Arnie. 

---

Kid has a truck, he does hauling. Arnie said he did a good job and he was looking for more work.

---

## HELEN:
Oh, so he’s just hauling.

---

## BRUCE:
Hauling. Other things. I don’t know.

---

## HELEN:
Oh. So, you’re thinking he’s going to be working here, at the house?

---

## BRUCE:
What difference does it make?

---

## HELEN:
I—I—I just—

---

## BRUCE:
Arnie recommended him, okay?

## HELEN:
Okay. I’m just, I’m trying to get a sense of—

---

## BRUCE:
Crissakes, I know him. He was my student a few years back. Okay?

---

## BRUCE: 
What, do you think I’m bringing some bum around? 

---

Is that the bug up your ass? Christ.

---

## JOHN:
You know something else funny about that movie? 

---

It’s that the love bug is actually a car. Even though it’s a car,

---

they call it a bug.

---

## BRUCE:
Raaahr! Okay, that’s enough. Come on, Roy, let’s go inside. I’ll show you that wallpaper.

---

[KIDS PROTESTING]

## BRUCE:	
Enough! 

Bunch of little monsters.

---

## CHRISTIAN:
Mom, can we watch TV?

---

## HELEN:
Sure.

## ALISON:
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT’S TRUE,

DIG DEEP INTO WHO

AND WHAT AND WHY AND WHEN,<br>
UNTIL NOW GIVES WAY TO THEN…

---

## ROY:
Whoa. Nice room.

---

## BRUCE:
So this is the wallpaper. William Morris. The real deal. God, it’s gorgeous.

---

## ROY:
You read all these books?

---

## BRUCE:
Working on it.

---

## ROY:
That is not something I can imagine.

---

## BRUCE:
Yes, I remember from class you’re not much of a reader.

---

## ROY:
Nope. Read some good books in your class, though.

---

## BRUCE:
My job is to make it interesting.

---

## ALISON:
It’s like a 1950s lesbian pulp novel. 	

---

“Their tawdry love could only flourish in the shadows.”

---

## SMALL ALISON:
I like Roy. He’s funny.

---

## HELEN:
Alison, find something to do. I’m practicing.

---


---

## SMALL ALISON:
Did Choppin’ write Chopsticks?

---

## HELEN:
It’s SHO-pan. 

Alison, stop bothering me.

---

## BRUCE:
Sit down. Take a load off.

---

## ROY:
I've been working, I’m disgusting. 

---

Don’t wanna sweat all over your nice stuff. 

---

## BRUCE:
What are you talking about, it’s *furniture* for chrissakes. Go ahead. Stretch out if you want.

---

## ROY:
This place is like a museum. 

What’s that stuff?

---

## BRUCE:
Sherry. Want some?

---

## ROY:
Is it good?

---

## BRUCE:
Yeah.

---

## ROY:
Okay, sure. I remember this house before you moved in. 

---

We used to ride our bikes over here when we were kids. You’ve done a shitload of work.

---

## BRUCE:
I did. By myself, most of it.

---

## ROY:
You must be in good shape, old man.

---

## BRUCE:
NOT TOO BAD IF I SAY SO MYSELF<br>
I MIGHT STILL BREAK A HEART OR TWO

YOU’D BE SURPRISED AT WHAT A GUY MY AGE KNOWS HOW TO DO

---

Want it?

## ROY:
Yeah.

Unbutton your shirt.

Is that your wife playing the piano?

Don’t worry about her.

## MEDIUM ALISON:
Dear Mom and Dad, 

---


Thanks for the care package. I was running out of granola bars so it came right in the nick of time. 

---

They sell a kind here that I swear is made of paste.

---


---

Nothing else worth writing home about. Har har. 	

---

Al.

---



I can draw you some posters.

---

## JOAN:
Nah, we need ‘em tomorrow night.

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
I’ll do it right now.

---

## JOAN:
Really?

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
Just some simple drawing, right? Sure. So you want it to say…

---

## JOAN:
We just need some really good “No Nukes” posters.

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
Right, okay. So, something like maybe…

---

## JOAN:
Oh, that’s funny. 

---


---

That’s really good.

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
This? No. This is just quick and stupid.

---

## JOAN:
Who’s this in the photo?

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
My dad.

---

## JOAN:
That’s your *dad?*

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
Yeah.

---

## JOAN:
He looks cool. Did he teach you how to draw cartoons?

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
[LAUGHING]
Definitely not.

---

## JOAN:
Why’s that funny?

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
It’s not funny, it’s just, he’s more… I don’t know. Refined.

---

## JOAN:
What does he do?

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
A bunch of things, actually. He’s a historical society, house restoration kind of guy, 

---

he’s a high-school English teacher, he runs the local— 

---

## JOAN:
Did you get to be in his class?

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
I was, yeah.

---

## JOAN:
Really?

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
Yeah.

---

## JOAN:
I was joking.

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
Oh. Oh. Yes. What I was going to say is that, everyone in Beech Creek at some point is in my dad’s English class, 

---

and he’s known as a great teacher, so…

---

## JOAN:
Oh. Cool.

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
Yeah. He sends me books. We talk about them.

---

## JOAN:
He sends you books to read on top of your schoolwork?

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
Yeah.

---

## JOAN:
That’s a little weird.

---

## ALISON:
Is that weird? That’s really weird.

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
Why?

---

## JOAN:
I don’t know. Like, what books?

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
Like…

---

## JOAN:
Colette?

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
Yeah.

---

## JOAN:
Your father sent you *Colette?*

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
Yeah. Why?

---

## JOAN:
I don’t know. It’s just… He’s like the opposite of my dad. 

---

He’s just, like, sending you lesbian books?

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
What? No! I mean, yes, I guess Colette was a lesbian but—

---

## JOAN:
Oh, she was.

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
Okay... But he sent it to me because he thought I’d be interested in the whole Paris… Arts… Bohemian… Scene.

---

## JOAN:
Yeah but he didn’t send you a book about Toulouse-Latrec, he sent you Colette. 

---

I think it’s amazing that he’s cool with you being a dyke.

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
What? I don’t think so.

---

## JOAN:
Oh, he’s not?

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
No. I don’t know. 

---

Can we talk about something else?

---

## JOAN:
Sure. Why?

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
Because – I have no idea how my parents feel about – I just figured it out myself.

---

## JOAN:
Oh.

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
About two weeks ago.

---

## JOAN:
Huh. With who?

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
With who what?

---

## ALISON:
Oh, god.

---

## JOAN:
Who were you with?

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
Nobody. 

*NOBODY!* Oh my god, I am so embarrassed.

---

## ALISON:
Oh, god!

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
I was in a bookstore.

---

## JOAN:
In a bookstore? Nice.

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
What? *NO!* Two weeks ago I was downtown and I wandered into the bookstore, 

---

I was just browsing around and I picked up this book – 

---

## JOAN:
Ah, “Word is Out.”

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
And I was like, Oh, interviews. This looks interesting. 

---

And then I was like, These people are all – Uh…

---

## JOAN:
Gay?

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
Gay. Yes. And *then* I was like, “Oh my god, 

---

template: 2col
## MEDIUM ALISON: 
*I’m* a lesb—


## JOAN: 
A dyke.

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
Yes! A dyke, yes. And I totally flipped out and shoved the book back onto the shelf and I left. 

---

And then I came back the next day and bought the book. 

---

And then I came back the next day and bought all the other books in that section. 

---

And then I made myself go to the meeting at the Gay Union. 

---

And then, and then, it’s now. 

Hi.

---

## JOAN:
Hello. 	

---

That’s a powerful book.

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
It is.

---

## JOAN:
So. I should probably go.

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
‘kay.

---

## JOAN:
So… Will I see you at the Union meeting tomorrow afternoon?

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
Yeah I’ll be, uh, yeah, I will come to the meeting. 

---

I’ll bring these posters. Finish ‘em up.

---

## JOAN:
Cool. I’ll see you then. Bye, Alison.

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
Bye, Joan.

---


---

## BRUCE:
Oh no you don’t. Sweatshirt off. 

---

Look, you’ve messed this up already. Where’s your barrette?

---

## SMALL ALISON:
Ow!

---

## BRUCE:
Sneakers.

---

## SMALL ALISON:
Why??

---

## BRUCE:
Because you’re going to a party. Here.

---

## SMALL ALISON:
I don’t want to wear those.

---

## BRUCE:
Tough titty.

---

## SMALL ALISON:
I DESPISE THIS DRESS

WHAT’S THE MATTER WITH BOYS’ SHIRTS AND PANTS?

---

## BRUCE:
You’re a girl.

---

## SMALL ALISON:
THIS DRESS MAKES ME FEEL LIKE A CLOWN.

I hate it!

---

## BRUCE:	
That’s enough. We’re late.

---

## SMALL ALISON:
You’re wearing a girl color.

---

## BRUCE:
Every other girl at this party is going to be wearing her prettiest dress and you want to put on… 

---

What? What? Your jean jacket? Trousers? S’alright with me. 

---

You understand you’ll be the *only* girl there not wearing a dress, right? 

---

Is that what you want? You want everybody talking about you behind your back. 

---

S’alright with me, change your clothes. 

---

Well? Go ahead. You gonna change?

Dear Mom and Dad, 

I am a lesbian.

---

## JOAN:
Hey.

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
I did it!

---

## JOAN:
Did what?

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
I told my parents.

---

## JOAN:
Told them what?

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
That I’m a lesbian.

---

## JOAN:
Oh! How are they taking it? What do they say?

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
Oh, nothing. I just put it in the mailbox just now.

---

## JOAN:
Oh.

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
But I feel so… *tough!* So sure of myself. 

---

So many things, oh my god, so many things suddenly makes so much sense!

---

## JOAN:
Like, oh, that’s why I was in love with my first grade teacher!

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
That is why I was in love with my first grade teacher.

---

## JOAN:
Welcome, my friend. Welcome to the club.

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
Thank you. Thank you very much.

---

## JOAN:
Okay! Okay, new lesbian! You and I are going to a party at the Women’s Collective tonight.

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
Oh. Uh…

---

## JOAN:
What?

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
It’s just—I just have a lot of work.

---

## JOAN:
No you don’t.

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
Yes I do.

---

## JOAN:
What’s going on?

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
Nothing.

---

## JOAN:
What?

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
I don’t know if I fit in.

---

## JOAN:
With who?

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
The lesbians. 

The real lesbians. You know what I mean. 

---

They’re political and socially conscious and… Real lesbians. 

---

Look, the only thing I really know about myself is that I’m asexual. 

---

I am. I’m not attracted to men but that doesn’t necessarily mean I’m attracted to women.

---


---

## ALISON:
[LAUGHING] Oh my god, it’s so embarrassing. 

---

“Went to a meeting at the Gay Union tonight. I was petrified. 

---

A lot of political talk. Almost too much, but ultimately a reasonable amount.” 

---

What does that mean?

---

“I signed up to help organize a ‘Take Back the Night March.’ 

---

I don’t know why I did it. I don’t know what that is.” 

---

[LAUGHING] Oh my god.

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT?
ARE YOU REALLY HERE?

JOAN, JOAN, JOAN, JOAN, JOAN

## ALISON:
Caption: I leapt out of the closet – 

---

and four months later my father killed himself by stepping in front of a truck.

---

While I was in college, exploding into my new life, you were sitting here reading a book.

---

## SMALL ALISON:
Mom, I have a question.

---

## HELEN:
What?

---

## SMALL ALISON:
What was the name of that street you lived on in New York?

---

## HELEN:
Bleecker?

---

## SMALL ALISON:
Yeah, good. 

---

Mom, I have a question.

---

## HELEN:
What?

---

## SMALL ALISON:
When Dad was in the Army and you lived in Germany what color was your house?

---

## HELEN:
Well, it was an apartment, not a house. And I don’t remember what color it was.

---

## SMALL ALISON:
Alright something else about what it looked like then.

---

## HELEN: 
Uh… Well, we had a balcony, we had a lovely balcony and in the mornings friends of ours would come over 

---

and we’d sit there and talk and have breakfast.

---

## SMALL ALISON:
Okay, where did you live after that?

---

## HELEN:
Here. Your grandfather died while we were there, so we came back.

---

## SMALL ALISON:
Oh yeah, ‘cause Daddy had to run the Fun Home.

---

## HELEN:
Yes.

---

## SMALL ALISON:
Ooh, I know! Daddy, you saw the Leaning Tower of Pisa one time, right?

---

## BRUCE:
I did. 

What’s that?

---

## SMALL ALISON:
In school we’re learning maps and globes, 

---

and Miss Windsor said draw a map of all places people in our family have been to.

---

## BRUCE:
Aha.

---

## SMALL ALISON:
They’re for showing tomorrow in class.

---

## BRUCE:
What’s this?

---

## SMALL ALISON:
Okay, so: This is a keystone because Pennsylvania is the Keystone state.

---

## BRUCE:
This square?

---

## SMALL ALISON:
That’s Beech Creek, see? That’s the bridge, that’s the ford, that’s the creek, the Fun Home, our house, 

---

Aunt Jane and Uncle Randy’s house – That’s Germany! 

---

Ooh, I know. John, Christian, me. See? Floating in bubbles because we’re not born yet – 

---

## BRUCE:
Okay, that’s... interesting but let me show you how you can make it better. 

---

This is visually confusing; you’ve got about ten different drawings so you can’t really see any of them. 

---

Pick one.

---

## SMALL ALISON:
But this is a cartoon and in a cartoon there’s all different parts.

---

## BRUCE:
But we can make it better than a cartoon.

---

## SMALL ALISON:
I like cartoons.

---

## BRUCE:
Sure, cartoons are fun but I’m showing you here how to do something substantial and beautiful. 

---

Listen to me, you have the potential to become a real artist. 

---

Do you know that? You do. But that means you have to learn the craft, you have to study the rules. 

---

Let’s talk about composition. You’ve got too much going on here. 

---

Pick one area.

---

## SMALL ALISON:
The Keystone State.

---

## BRUCE:
That’s too much. Watch this. 

---

I’m going to draw our mountains. 

See that? How I’m shading them? 

---

See how that gives them dimension.

Let me try.

---

## BRUCE:
Alison, this is the way it should look.

---

## SMALL ALISON:
But I liked the way mine was.

---

## BRUCE:
But you cannot do it like that unless you want to ruin it. 

---

I am trying to teach you something important.

---

## HELEN:
Bruce, it doesn’t matter. It’s a drawing.

---

## BRUCE:
What do you mean it doesn’t matter? She’s taking it to school. 

---

She’s showing it in class. <br>
You know what, never mind. 

---

You want to take a half-baked mess to school, you want to embarrass yourself like that, it’s fine with me.

Do what you want.

I have to see a psychiatrist.

How come?

Because I do dumb dangerous things. Because I’m bad.

Not good like you.

Actually it’s because you were arrested, Dad.

On a charge of “furnishing a malt beverage to a minor,” which I believe is what they call a euphemism.

---

## SMALL ALISON:
Daddy said he’s going to Danville.

---

## HELEN:
Oh.

---

## SMALL ALISON:
He said he has to see a psychiatrist?

---

## HELEN:
He does.

---

## SMALL ALISON:
How come?

---

## HELEN:
The… um… A judge said he had to go. It’s been very… complicated. 

---

We thought we might have to move and then – 

---

## SMALL ALISON:
Move?? Where would we go??

---

## HELEN:
We don’t have to move. The judge said your dad could—could... see someone instead. 

---

I can’t explain it any better. You don’t need to worry. Everything’s going to be fine.

---

## ALISON:
Oh yes, everything’s going to be just fine. Slam. Crash.

Let me in!

## SMALL ALISON:
Are you a Land Shark?

---

## JOHN:
Let me in!

---

## CHRISTIAN:
Land Shark. You have to say Land Shark.

---

## BRUCE:
Kids, let him in. 

Don’t play in the hall like that. 

---

Ellie told us her neighbors don’t like it. She won’t let us stay here again if you do that.

---

## ALISON:
Okay, okay, caption… Caption… Uh… 

---

Clueless in New York. 

In denial in New York. 

---

Family Fun in New York. 

Child neglect in New York. I don’t know…

---

## SMALL ALISON:
Can I eat one of these chocolates?

---

## BRUCE:
No, those are to take home for your mother. Put them back.

---

## SMALL ALISON:
Can I look at the Bar-mitch-nih-kov book?

---

## BRUCE:
Baryshnikov. Yes, but be careful with it.

---

## SMALL ALISON:
What’s the name of that museum we’re going to see tomorrow?

---

## BRUCE:
The Frick.

---

## SMALL ALISON:
Oh yeah.

---

## CHRISTIAN:
Remember this song? 
(singing)

“Shit Richie, Shit Richie”

---

## SMALL ALISON:
That was so funny! Remember the song about the *tits and ass?*

---

## BRUCE:
Kids.

---

## ALISON:
Okay… Sleeping bags. Shopping bags. Window was open. Really hot. Stinky—

---

Stinky—no, no… *Humectant. “The humectant air.”* Something on *“the humectant air.”*

---

Okay, good phrase. Good.

---

## BRUCE:
Get into bed. It’s late.

---

## CHRISTIAN:
Whoa! Did somebody just blow up that trash can?

---

## ALISON:
Fireworks.

---

## BRUCE:
Just homemade fireworks.

---

## CHRISTIAN:
There’s so many sailor guys.

---

## BRUCE:
That’s ‘cause there’s ships here from all over the world.

---

## CHRISTIAN:
For the bicentennial?

---

## BRUCE:
Yeah. Come on. Lay down. Go to sleep. Big day tomorrow.

---

## ALISON:
Oh, my sleeping bag! I *loved* that sleeping bag. 

Kids In Bags. 

---

And… *four locks* on the front door. Amazing. Oh yeah. 

---

Coat hook with jackets piled like… twenty deep on the one arm. Crazy.

Ooh, that basket with the Village Voices.

---

## SMALL ALISON:
Where are you going?

---

## BRUCE:
Oh. Just out. Just for a minute. What’s a matter, you can’t sleep?

I’m just running out for a paper. I’ll be back in a sec.

You’re going to fall asleep so fast you’ll be asleep before I get back.

---

## SMALL ALISON:
But where are you going?

## ALISON:
Caption: Dad goes out. 

Dad gets a newspaper. 

---

Dad goes… cruising? 

---

Dad picks up a hustler? 

No, he didn’t. 

---

Maybe he did. I don’t really know. Who knows?

---

## JOAN:
What happened?

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
Dad finally responded to my letter.

---

## JOAN:
Oh my god. What does he say?

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
“Dear Al,

---

Sorry for being out of touch. Big week here at the Fun Home. 

---

Couple of kids from Lock Haven wrapped their car around a tree and I ended up working two eighteen-hour shifts. 

---

Bad for my blood pressure. Oh, by the way, we got your letter. 

---

Well, kid, talk about a flair for the dramatic.” 

---

## BRUCE:
The way I see it, the good news is, you’re human.

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
What does that mean? What else would I be?

---

## BRUCE:
Your mother’s pretty upset though—not surprisingly, I guess. But I’m of the opinion that everyone should experiment.

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
Seriously?

---

## BRUCE:
I can’t say, though, that I see the point of putting a label on yourself. 

---

There have been a few times in my life when I thought about taking a stand, but I’m not a hero. 

---

Is that a cop out? Maybe so. It’s hard sometimes to tell what is really worth it.

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
God, I just—

---

## JOAN:
I’m sorry.

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
The *tone* is what I can’t stand. It’s so typical. So all-knowing. 

---

He has to be the expert. Lots of wisdom and advice about things he doesn’t know anything about! 

---

I’m gay. Which means I’m not like him, and I’ve *never* been like him, and he can’t handle that. 

---

He still wants to be the… the intellectual, broadminded, liberal, *bohemian* but he can’t pull it off 

---

because he can’t deal with me, and you know what? He never could. He never could.

---


---

## BRUCE:
I need more coffee. Where’s Betty?

---

## SMALL ALISON:
She left. Lorna’s on now.

---

## BRUCE:
Oh. 

---

## BRUCE:
Huh.

---

## SMALL ALISON:
What?

---

## BRUCE:
Bill Smoot’s running for town council. He didn’t mention it at Rotary. 

---


Hey. Where’s your barrette?

---


Put it back in. It keeps the hair out of your eyes.

---

## SMALL ALISON:
So would a crew cut.

---

## BRUCE:
If I see you without it again I’ll whale you. 

---

Go find Lorna. I need coffee.

---


---

## ALISON:
You didn’t notice her at first but I saw her the moment she walked in. 

---

She was a delivery woman; she came in with a handcart full of packages. 

---

She was an old-school butch.

---

## SMALL ALISON:
SOMEONE JUST CAME IN THE DOOR<br>
LIKE NO ONE I EVER SAW BEFORE

---

I FEEL – <br>
I FEEL – 

---

I DON’T KNOW WHERE YOU CAME FROM<br>
I WISH I DID, I FEEL SO DUMB

I FEEL –

YOUR SWAGGER AND YOUR BEARING<br>
AND THE JUST-RIGHT CLOTHES YOU’RE WEARING

YOUR SHORT HAIR AND YOUR DUNGAREES <br>
AND YOUR LACE UP BOOTS

---

AND YOUR KEYS, OH<br>
YOUR RING OF KEYS

---

I THOUGHT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE WRONG<br>
BUT YOU SEEM OKAY WITH BEING STRONG

---

I WANT – 

YOU’RE SO –

---

IT’S PROB’LY CONCEITED TO SAY

---


BUT I THINK WE’RE ALIKE IN A CERTAIN WAY

---

I, UM – 

---

YOUR SWAGGER AND YOUR BEARING<br>
AND THE JUST-RIGHT CLOTHES YOU’RE WEARING

YOUR SHORT HAIR AND YOUR DUNGAREES <br>
AND YOUR LACE UP BOOTS

DO YOU FEEL MY HEART <br>
SAYING HI?

IN THIS WHOLE LUNCHEONETTE <br>
WHY AM I THE ONLY ONE

WHO SEES YOU’RE BEAUTIFUL—

No.

I MEAN… HANDSOME

YOUR SWAGGER AND YOUR BEARING


AND THE JUST-RIGHT CLOTHES YOU’RE WEARING

YOUR SHORT HAIR AND YOUR DUNGAREES <br>
AND YOUR LACE UP BOOTS

Hello?

## MEDIUM ALISON:
Hey, Dad. 

---

## BRUCE:
Kiddo! How are ya?

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
I got your response to my letter.

---

## BRUCE:
Oh. Oh, good. 

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
It was a little confusing.

---

## BRUCE:
Before I forget, d’ja get the book I sent? The Joyce. Portrait of the—

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
Yes, I got it.

---

## BRUCE:
You better damn well identify with every last page!

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
If you’re not going to talk to me about my letter, put Mom on the phone.

---

## BRUCE:
Well, she’s watching something on TV.

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
Would you ask her, please, if she’ll talk to me?

---

## BRUCE:
Sure.

---

## HELEN:
Hello?

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
Hi, Mom.

---

## HELEN:
How are you? How’s your school work?

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
It’s… fine. Are you ever going to talk to me about my letter?

---

## HELEN:
I’m—I’m really at odds here. I feel responsible—

---

template: 2col
## HELEN: 
I do feel children should be allowed to make their own mistakes, you know that. 


## MEDUIM ALISON:
Mom, you didn’t cause this—That’s not how this works!

---

## HELEN: 
And you know that I don’t like parents who meddle, but in this case I’m uniquely qualified

---

template: 2col
## HELEN:
to warn you against romanticizing this path. 


## MEDIUM ALISON:
Oh, please!

---

## HELEN: 
Alison, you probably don’t know that on more than one occasion catastrophe has been 

---

template: 2col
## HELEN: 
narrowly averted and it is difficult for me to – 


## MEDIUM ALISON:
Catastrophe? Could you be a little more overdramatic?

---

## HELEN:
Alison, your father has had affairs with men.

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
What?

---

## HELEN:
Some of them young men, teenagers. I don’t know how he hasn’t been caught or exposed. 

---

There was the thing with Roy.

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
Our yard guy? Our *babysitter???*

---

## HELEN:
What do you think he was doing when he went out in the middle of the night, or taking his “trips?” 

---

One time he came back with body lice. 

---


It’s been going on for years. For our whole marriage, actually.

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
Why are you telling me this and not Dad?

---

## HELEN:
Your father? Tell the truth? Please.

---

## JOAN:
No, what?? Your *dad???* Oh my god. Are you okay?

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
I’m fine.

---

## JOAN:
Are you sure? Do you need to talk about it?

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
No. No, I don’t want to talk about it, I don’t want to think about it. I want to—

---

I don’t know. Let’s go see what’s happening at the Gay Union.

---

## JOAN:
Wanna go to my room? 
Smoke a joint?

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
Yes, I do.

---

## ALISON:
Caption: My newfound queerness—No. 

---

Unable to process this tsunami-like revelation from my father—"Tsunami-like???"" No.

---


Caption: I leapt into my new life with both feet, and I blocked out everything that was happening at home.

---

## BRUCE:
Where the hell are John and Christian???

---

## HELEN:
John’s at Cosgrove’s probably.

---

## BRUCE:
Why?

---

## HELEN:
Because he works there.

---

## ALISON:
I should have been paying attention. 

---

*Caption:* I should have been paying attention.

---

## BRUCE:
Since when?

---

## HELEN:
He’s been working there almost a month.

---

## BRUCE:
Oh.

---

## ALISON:
And I—*Caption!* I was, I guess I was *mad* at you, Dad.

---

## BRUCE:
Where’s Christian?

---

## HELEN:
At Doug’s probably. What do you need?

---

## BRUCE:
Nothing. Nothing. I’ll do it myself.

---

## ALISON:
My life had just started to open.

---

## BRUCE:
Dammit! Godammit!

---

## ALISON:
I didn’t know, Dad, I had no way of knowing that my beginning would be your end!

---

## HELEN:
Oh my god. The Brinley. Oh my god, what happened? Did it fall?

---

Bruce, the painting. What happened?

---

## BRUCE:
I threw it down the fucking stairs.

---

## HELEN:
Why??

---

## BRUCE:
I don’t know why!

---

## HELEN:
Bruce I don’t know what’s – 

---

## BRUCE:
Because no one fucking helps me around here! Because I can’t stand the sound of your hectoring,

---

template: 2col
## HELEN:
You *stop.* You’re blaming *me?* After what you’ve put me through? 


## BRUCE:
shrewish voice, your histrionics, your—

---

## HELEN:
I’m on edge every minute. You’re so—

---

## BRUCE:
Every single person in this town knows what kind of a man I am! You’re the one with the problem!

---


---

## HELEN:
I have to go to school. <br>
I’ll be at meetings until late.

---

## ALISON:
I’m drawing. I’m drawing. I’m just drawing. I’m remembering something, that’s *all.*

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
God, I don’t wanna go in.

---

## JOAN:
It’s going to be okay.

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
How’s it going to be okay? Everything’s… Who knows? Who knows? 

---

Come on in, let me introduce you to my *gay dad.* It’s only been three months since I left here! 

---

What happened in three months?

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
Hello? I don’t know where they are. Hey! We’re here!

---

## JOAN:
Oh my god. 

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
What?

---

## JOAN:
You described it, I just—I had no idea.

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
Why? Oh, yeah, I guess it’s pretty—

---

## HELEN:
Oh! You’re here.

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
Hi Mom.

---

## HELEN:
Is this your friend?

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
Yeah, this is Joan.

---

## JOAN:
Thanks for letting me come, Mrs. Bechdel.

---

## HELEN:
Very nice to meet you, Joan.

---

## BRUCE:
Hey there you are! Hey! Welcome home! The prodigal returns!!

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
Hey Dad, This is – 

---

## BRUCE:
Joan! Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. 

---

Listen, I’ve gotta pick up some three-quarter inch ply from Bittner’s before they close. 

---

Hey, Kiddo, you wanna go for a drive later?

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
Sure.

---

So.

---

## HELEN:
My goodness, it’s lunchtime. Are you girls hungry?

---

## JOAN:
I’m fine. You?

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
We’re okay.

---

## HELEN:
Sure?

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
Yeah, we stopped at a diner on our way here. But you should go ahead and eat.

---

## HELEN:
I’m fine. I might have a glass of wine though. Would either of you like a glass of wine?

---

template: 2col
## JOAN:
Oh, no that’s okay, Mrs. Bechdel. 


## MEDIUM ALISON:
Uh…

---

## JOAN:
Uh... Maybe you two would like a chance to talk?

---

template: 2col
## MEDIUM ALISON:
Huh?


## HELEN:
Oh.

---

## JOAN:
Cuz I actually wouldn’t mind laying down for a little bit. 

---

I’m still pretty wiped out from last week.

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
Okay. Uh—I thought I’d put her up in the lilac room?

---

## HELEN:
Sure.

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
Upstairs, first door to the right.

---

## JOAN:
Great. Come get me whenever.

---

## HELEN:
You must be tired too.

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
I’m okay. 

---


---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
So. How’ve things been here?

---

## HELEN:
He bought that old shell of a house out on Route 150. Did he tell you that?

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
Oh yeah, I think he mentioned it in one of his letters. 

---

I’ve been getting two, three, sometimes four a week. They’re kind of manic—

---

## HELEN:
Years ago he talked about buying it and he looked it over and decided it wasn’t worth it, 

---

it was too far gone and that was back then so I don’t know why now that it’s even more broken down 

---

he’s decided he can fix it up. He probably can.

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
Probably.

---

## HELEN:
He’s out there day and night, like a maniac, not eating, I don’t think he’s sleeping. 

---

Sometimes I walk into a room and he’s just standing there, not moving, frozen, like a statue.

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
Yeah, I don’t know. He’s—

---

## HELEN:
I’m sick of it. I’m sick of cooking for him and I’m sick of cleaning this… museum.

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
It’s too much. You’ve done too much.

---

## HELEN:
You know, shortly after we were married we took a drive from Germany, where we were living, to Paris. 

---

He wanted me to meet an Army buddy of his. We had a beautiful drive. 

---

And then, just outside of Paris, he just went crazy. Just started screaming at me. 

---

Why couldn’t I read a simple fucking map? I was a stupid, worthless bitch. 

---

I was dumbfounded. I was terrified—it came out of nowhere as far as I knew. 

---

Of course, I learned later that this man had been your father’s lover.

---

## MEDIUM ALISON:
I don’t know how you’ve done it.

---

## HELEN:

so we thought why not stick it to the man on our way out!

Oh god, this story?

You didn’t tell me your dad was a troublemaker.

Has he got you polishing silver??

I don’t know what to say. He made it sound like a great idea.

---

I charmed her into it.

He charmed me into it.

Hey Al, come play this one with your old dad.

No. Dad!

## MEDIUM ALISON:
I was just wondering if you knew what you were doing when you gave me that Colette book.

## BRUCE:

TELEPHONE WIRE<br>
SUN DOWN ON THE CREEK

PARTLY FROZEN, PARTLY FLOWING,<br>
MUST BE WINDY, TREES ARE BENDING,

---

JUNCTION 50, FIELD NEEDS MOWING<br>

SAY SOMETHING, TALK TO HIM<br>

TELEPHONE WIRE<br>
LONG BLACK LINE

TELEPHONE WIRE<br>
FINELY THREADED SKY

## BRUCE:
THERE WAS A BOY<br>
IN COLLEGE

---

MY FIRST YEAR THERE<br>
NORRIS JONES

---

HE HAD BLACK WAVY HAIR<br>
NORRIS JONES

---

WHERE IS HE NOW?

---

FOURTEEN YEARS OLD<br>
IN SWENSEN’S BARN IT WAS COLD

---

LOTS OF BOYS MESSED AROUND, YOU KNOW<br>
FOR THEM, IT WAS A GAME THEY OUTGREW

---

BUT I ALWAYS KNEW

---

## ALISON:
DAD, ME TOO! <br>
SINCE, LIKE FIVE, I GUESS

---

I PREFERRED TO WEAR BOYS’ SHIRTS AND PANTS<br>
I FELT ABSURD IN A DRESS

---

I REALLY TRIED TO DENY MY FEELINGS FOR GIRLS<br>
BUT I WAS LIKE YOU 

---

DAD, ME TOO

---

## BRUCE:
NORRIS JONES

---

## ALISON:
Dad!

---

## BRUCE:
NORRIS JONES

---

## ALISON:
Dad?

---

## BRUCE:
Did I tell you I’ve taken on a new project? 

---

That old house out on Route 150. You’ve seen it, Al. It’s been sitting empty out there for forty, 

---

## BRUCE:
fifty years at least.


## ALISON:
TELEPHONE WIRE<br>
STOP! TOO FAST!

---

TELEPHONE WIRE<br>
MAKE THIS NOT THE PAST

---

THIS CAR RIDE!

---

THIS IS WHERE IT HAS TO HAPPEN<br>
THERE MUST BE SOME OTHER CHANCES

THERE’S A MOMENT I’M FORGETTING<br>
WHERE YOU TELL ME YOU SEE ME 

---

SAY SOMETHING, <br>
TALK TO ME!

---

SAY SOMETHING, <br>
ANYTHING!

---

AT THE LIGHT! <br>

---

THIS CAN’T BE OUR LAST –

## BRUCE:
That was fun. It’s earlier than I thought. Comin’ in?

---


---

## ALISON:
TELEPHONE WIRE<br>
THAT WAS OUR LAST NIGHT

---


---

## ALISON:
What’s this? Table in the living room with – Jack in the pulpit. No, I was going to draw that

---

template: 2col
## BRUCE:
Dear Al, It was great to <br>have you home.


## ALISON:
in this panel.

---

## BRUCE:
I’ve been flying high ever since you were here.


## ALISON:
What’s this? This. I can draw this… Draw this in the… 

---

## BRUCE:
Dear Al, I’ll admit I’m somewhat envious 


## ALISON:
Oh.

---

template: 2col
## BRUCE:
of the ‘new’ freedom that appears on campuses today.


## ALISON:
This is good. This is good. I could… I could…

---

## BRUCE:
Dear Al, Did you receive that Winogrand article I was telling you about? You should have gotten it by now. 

---

template: 2col
## ALISON:
What did it feel like to step in front of a truck, Dad?


## BRUCE:
Do you know I was never even in New York until I was about twenty?

---

template: 2col
## ALISON:
What did it feel like to see it coming right at you and not move?

## BRUCE:
Dear Al, I just re-read Araby. That could have been me – 

---

template: 2col
## ALISON:
And just let it hit you?


## BRUCE:
I was rather sensitive when I was little, you know—

---

template: 2col
## ALISON:
*Why?* Was it because of me? Did it have *nothing* to do with me?


## BRUCE:
Dear Al, I’ve been working like mad on that house I told you about. 

---
template: 2col
## ALISON:
*What happened?*

## BRUCE:
Can’t think about much else. 

---

## BRUCE:
Can’t sleep – 

Dear Al—

---

I FUCKING LOVE BEGINNINGS<br>
FLYING HIGH

---

HARD TO KNOW WHERE TO START<br>
IT’S ALL SO FAST I’M TRYING NOT TO SPIN

---

I GUESS I’M OLDER

AND IT’S HARDER WHEN YOU’RE OLDER TO BEGIN

---

PEELING PLASTER, SAGGING ROOF,<br>
TWO MISSING STAIRS, A BUCKLED WALL

---

I’M FIRED UP TO DO THIS

BUT ON MY OWN IT ALL…

---

SO MUCH DAMAGE, BROKEN WINDOWS,<br>
PIPES ARE SHIT, CRAP VENEER

---

IT’S HOUR LATER, JESUS 

I’M STILL STANDING HERE

---

STILL STANDING HERE

---

BUT WHEN THE SUNLIGHT HITS THE PARLOR WALL<br>
AT CERTAIN TIMES OF DAY

---

I SEE HOW FINE THIS HOUSE COULD BE<br>
I SEE IT SO DAMN CLEAR

---

WHAT’S THE MATTER? 

WHY AM I STANDING HERE?

---

BAD FOUNDATION, TWISTING FLOORBOARDS,<br>
SHODDY PIPES, A GAPING HOLE

---

IT’S A LOT, IT’S A LOT <br>
TO KEEP UNDER CONTROL

---

SOMETHING CRACKING, SOMETHING ROTTING<br>
PILES OF RUIN AND DEBRIS

---

KILLING ME! CRUSHING ME! PUSHING ME!

---

BUT WHEN THE SUNLIGHT HITS THE PARLOR WALL<br>
AT CERTAIN TIMES OF DAY

---

I SEE HOW FINE THIS HOUSE COULD BE<br>
I SEE IT SO DAMN CLEAR

---

WHAT’S THE MATTER? 

WHY AM I STANDING HERE?

---

DEAR AL, I’M SCARED.

I HAD A LIFE I THOUGHT I UNDERSTOOD.

---

I TOOK IT AND I SQUEEZED OUT <br>
EVERY BIT OF LIFE I COULD

---

BUT THE EDGES OF THE WORLD <br>
THAT HELD ME UP HAVE GONE AWAY

---

AND I’M FALLING INTO NOTHINGNESS<br>
OR FLYING INTO SOMETHING SO SUBLIME

---

AND I’M 

---

A MAN I DON’T KNOW<br>
WHO AM I NOW? WHERE DO I GO?

---

I CAN’T GO BACK<br>
I CAN’T FIND MY WAY THROUGH

---

I MIGHT STILL BREAK A HEART OR TWO

---

BUT WHEN THE SUNLIGHT HITS THE PARLOR WALL<br>
AT CERTAIN TIMES OF DAY

---

I SEE HOW FINE THIS HOUSE COULD BE<br>
I SEE IT SO DAMN CLEAR

---

OH MY GOD!<br>
WHY AM I STANDING HERE?

---

I’m the only one here.

This is what I have of you: 

---

You ordering me to sweep and dust the parlor

You steaming off the wallpaper

---

You in front of a classroom of bored students

Digging up a dogwood tree

---

You working on the house, smelling like sawdust and sweat and designer cologne

---

You calling me at college to tell me how I’m supposed to feel about Faulkner or Hemingway

---


You… standing on the shoulder of Route 150 bracing yourself against the pulse of the trucks rushing past.

---

You… succumbing to a rare moment of physical contact with me

---

DADDY... COMMA... HEY DADDY<br>
