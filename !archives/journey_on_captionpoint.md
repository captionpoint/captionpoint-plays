## TOD:
Welcome to JOURNEY ON! Theater Latté Da's Cabaret Celebration of their 100th show!

---

## TOD:
A journey that started in 1998 and brings us all the way to... tonight! You! Us! And this!

---

## TOD:
Welcome! I think we're gonna have a really good time.

---

## TOD:
My name is Tod Petersen, and I'll be your journeyman host for this evening.

---

## TOD:
We'll be making some quick stops along the way to share some of the history of the company 

---

but the real reason for tonight's celebration is to share some of the iconic music that has defined us.

---

## TOD:
Every song you'll hear tonight will be from one of the 99 shows produced by Latté Da.

---

## TOD:
That last song, "Coffee in a Cardboard Cup" was actually the very first song, from the very first show, from BEFORE our very first season.

---

## TOD:
BEFORE Latté Da even had a name!

---

## TOD:
Okay, the name thing... 

---

How did a top notch professional theater company known for elegant, rigorous, innovative takes on musical theater come to be named after... coffee?

---

## TOD:
Well before anyone had an inkling about the full talents and artistic vision of our founding directors Peter Rothstein and Denise Prosek,

---

they were just two old high school buddies trying to put on little cabarets in, you guessed it, coffee shops!

---

## TOD:
So there you go. Theater! Latte! Ta Da!

---

## TOD:
And when the name was in place, what shows did Latté Da produce that very first season? 

---

Well I'm so glad you asked!

---

## TOD:
OH, S#!% I'M TURNING INTO MY MOTHER was a show we put together, where I played my mother, my father, my siblings, 

---

and even myself as an 11-year old trying for his first play...

---

## YOUNG TOD:
My name is Tod Petersen, 108 East Glencrest Drive, Mankato.

---

## YOUNG TOD:
For my tryouts for the play I would just like to sing "You Made Me Love You" by my all-time favorite actress of all time, Judy Garland.

---

## YOUNG TOD:
Hit it, Bradley!

---
class: song

## YOUNG TOD:
Dear Missus Garland, I am singing this to you,

---
class: song

## YOUNG TOD:
And I hope that you will read it so you know,

---
class: song

## YOUNG TOD:
My heart beats like a hammer,

---
class: song

## YOUNG TOD:
And I stutter and I stammer

---
class: song

## YOUNG TOD:
Every time I see you on the picture show.

---
class: song

## YOUNG TOD:
I guess I'm just another fan of yours,

---
class: song

## YOUNG TOD:
So I thought I'd sing and tell you so.

---
class: song

## YOUNG TOD:
You made me love you

---
class: song

## YOUNG TOD:
I didn't want to do it

---
class: song

## YOUNG TOD:
I didn't want to do it

---
class: song

## YOUNG TOD:
You made me want you

---
class: song

## YOUNG TOD:
And all the time you knew it

---
class: song

## YOUNG TOD:
I guess you always knew it

---
class: song

## YOUNG TOD:
You made me happy sometimes

---
class: song

## YOUNG TOD:
You made me glad

---
class: song

## YOUNG TOD:
But there were times, dear,

---
class: song

## YOUNG TOD:
You made me feel so bad

---
class: song

## YOUNG TOD:
You made me sigh for

---
class: song

## YOUNG TOD:
I didn't want to tell you

---
class: song

## YOUNG TOD:
I didn't want to tell you

---
class: song

## YOUNG TOD:
I want some love that's true

---
class: song

## YOUNG TOD:
Yes, I do, indeed I do

---
class: song

## YOUNG TOD:
You know I do

---
class: song

## YOUNG TOD:
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme what I cry for

---
class: song

## YOUNG TOD:
You know you've got the brand of kisses

---
class: song

## YOUNG TOD:
That I'd die for

---
class: song

## YOUNG TOD:
You know you made me love you.

---

## TOD:
From the very start, Theater Latté Da was all about creating new work.

---

## TOD:
OH, S#!%, I'M TURNING INTO MY MOTHER was born in Peter and Denise's hometown of Grand Rapids, Minnesota 

---

(also the birthplace of Judy Garland, something in the water!).

---

## TOD:
Peter used to host Judy Garland weekends at his family's cabin and would invite a bunch of us up

---

and we'd swim and boat and eat and go to the Judy Garland museum 

---

and on Saturday nights we'd have the Judy Garland Talent Show (where everybody was a winner) 

---

and I sang "You Made Me Love You" and did a few imitations of my mother 

---

(My name ain't baby. It's Carole. Mrs Petersen if you're nasty).

---

## TOD:
Peter's sweet mother Jean got a total kick out of the mother stuff and it was there that Peter clicked on the idea of producing a mother-themed show, 

---

where we would talk about our mothers and sing about our mothers and make fun of our mothers. 

---

(Sorry, mom!)

---

## TOD:
Latté Da didn't have a home theater yet so Peter booked a string of late night performances of OH, $#!% on the set of a halloween-themed show at the Loring Playhouse.

---

## TOD:
Which is now an office space near Loring Park. Which kind of breaks my heart.

---

## TOD:
The Loring became Latté Da's permanent home in 1999 and that's when the company as we know it today started to take shape: 

---

a mix of new works created by local artists (OH, $#%!), small scale operas (LA BOHÈME), new takes on both well-known musicals (GYPSY, SUNDAY IN THE PARK) 

---

and lesser-known musicals (FLOYD COLLINS, A MAN OF NO IMPORTANCE), and musical revues (like LOST IN BOSTON)...

---

## ERIN (ad-libbing):
*ad libs, reminisces about her first show being EVITA after being encouraged by the late, great Michael Matthew Ferrell,*

---

*and introduces the next selection as coming from the very first official Latté Da show, season one.*

---
class: song

## ERIN:
When I was a girl I had a favorite story

---
class: song

## ERIN:
Of the meadowlark who lived where the rivers wind.

---
class: song

## ERIN:
Her voice could match the angels' in its glory---

---
class: song

## ERIN:
But she was blind, the lark was blind.

---
class: song

## ERIN:
An old king came and took her to his palace

---
class: song

## ERIN:
Where the walls were burnished bronze and golden braid,

---
class: song

## ERIN:
And he fed her fruit and nuts from an ivory chalice,

---
class: song

## ERIN:
And he prayed:

---
class: song

## ERIN:
"Sing for me, my meadowlark,

---
class: song

## ERIN:
Sing for me of the silver morning,

---
class: song

## ERIN:
Set me free, my meadowlark,

---
class: song

## ERIN:
And I'll buy you a priceless jewel

---
class: song

## ERIN:
And cloth of brocade and crewel,

---
class: song

## ERIN:
And I'll love you for life,

---
class: song

## ERIN:
If you will sing for me."

---
class: song

## ERIN:
Then one day as the lark sang by the water,

---
class: song

## ERIN:
The god of the sun heard her in his flight,

---
class: song

## ERIN:
And her singing moved him so,

---
class: song

## ERIN:
He came and brought her the gift of sight.

---
class: song

## ERIN:
He gave her sight,

---
class: song

## ERIN:
And she opened her eyes to the shimmer and the splendor

---
class: song

## ERIN:
Of this beautiful, young god, so proud and strong.

---
class: song

## ERIN:
And he called to the lark in a voice both rough and tender:

---
class: song

## ERIN:
"Come along.

---
class: song

## ERIN:
Fly with me, my meadowlark,

---
class: song

## ERIN:
Fly with me on the silver morning,

---
class: song

## ERIN:
Past the sea where the dolphins bark.

---
class: song

## ERIN:
We will dance on the coral beaches,

---
class: song

## ERIN:
Make a feast of the plums and peaches,

---
class: song

## ERIN:
Just as far as your vision reaches---

---
class: song

## ERIN:
Fly with me."

---
class: song

## ERIN:
But the meadowlark said no,

---
class: song

## ERIN:
For the old king loved her so.

---
class: song

## ERIN:
She couldn't bear to wound his pride.

---
class: song

## ERIN:
So the sun god flew away,

---
class: song

## ERIN:
And when the king came down that day,

---
class: song

## ERIN:
He found his meadowlark had died.

---
class: song

## ERIN:
Every time I heard that part I cried...

---
class: song

## ERIN:
And now I stand here starry-eyed and stormy---

---
class: song

## ERIN:
Oh, just when I thought my heart was finally numb---

---
class: song

## ERIN:
A beautiful, young man appears before me,

---
class: song

## ERIN:
Singing: "Come, oh, won't you come?"

---
class: song

## ERIN:
And what can I do if finally for the first time

---
class: song

## ERIN:
The one I'm burning for returns the glow?

---
class: song

## ERIN:
If love has come at last it's picked the worst time.

---
class: song

## ERIN:
Still I know---

---
class: song

## ERIN:
I've got to go.

---
class: song

## ERIN:
Fly away, meadowlark,

---
class: song

## ERIN:
Fly away in the silver morning,

---
class: song

## ERIN:
If I stay, I'll grow to curse the dark.

---
class: song

## ERIN:
So it's off where the days won't bind me,

---
class: song

## ERIN:
I know I leave wounds behind me,

---
class: song

## ERIN:
But I won't let tomorrow find me

---
class: song

## ERIN:
Back this way.

---
class: song

## ERIN:
Before my past once again can blind me---

---
class: song

## ERIN:
Fly away...

---
class: song

## ERIN:
And we won't wait

---
class: song

## ERIN:
To say goodbye---

---
class: song

## ERIN:
My beautiful young man and I.

---
class: song

## ERIN:
Quando me'n vo'

---
class: song

## ERIN:
Quando me'n vo' soletta per la via,

---
class: song

## ERIN:
la gente sosta e mira

---
class: song

## ERIN:
e la bellezza mia tutta ricerca in me

---
class: song

## ERIN:
da capo a piè ...

---
class: song

## ERIN:
Ed assaporo allor la bramosia

---
class: song

## ERIN:
sottil, che da gli occhi traspira

---
class: song

## ERIN:
e dai palesi vezzi intender sa

---
class: song

## ERIN:
alle occulte beltà.

---
class: song

## ERIN:
Così l'effluvio del desìo tutta m'aggira,

---
class: song

## ERIN:
felice mi fa!

---
class: song

## ERIN:
E tu che sai, che memori e ti struggi

---
class: song

## ERIN:
da me tanto rifuggi?

---
class: song

## ERIN:
So ben:

---
class: song

## ERIN:
Le angoscie tue non le vuoi dir,

---
class: song

## ERIN:
ma ti senti morir!

Will there be trees? Is there light?

## FELIX:
Does it hover on the ground?

## FELIX:
Does it shine from all around or just from you?

## FELIX:
Is it endless and empty and you wander on your own?

---
class: song

## FELIX:
Slowly forget about the folks that you have known?

## FELIX:
Water's rising, bread fill up the air

Will my mama be there waiting for me?

## TOD:
As Latté Da's reputation grew, we began to outgrow the Loring Playhouse so Peter and Denise decided to... take the show on the road!

---

## TOD:
Over time there have been splashy transfers to the Fifth Ave in Seattle, Asolo Rep in Sarasota, Geva in upstate New York 

---

and in 2019, ALL IS CALM performed off-Broadway, winning a prestigious Drama Desk Award for Unique Theatrical Experience.

---

## TOD:
I know! Thank you! I had nothing to do with it!

---

## TOD:
In the early days there were many local partnerships and collaborations such as with Interact Center, Six Points, Arena Dances, VocalEssence, and venues: 

---

the Southern Theater, History Theatre, the old Ordway McKnight space, The Pantages and even the University of Minnesota 

---

-- which is where we produced the beautiful, heartbreaking SPRING AWAKENING...

So we've set sail on Act Two. And the time has finally come to pay tribute to a very key artist in the Latté Da story. 

---

A true genius. Any guesses?

---

## TOD:
Yes, Stephen Sondheim. You didn't think we'd go a full night without some Sondheim, did you?!

---

## TOD:
Of the 12 major Broadway musicals he wrote music and lyrics for, Latté Da has produced 8. 

---

Let's see if we can list them all. Major Broadway Sondheims. Music and lyrics?

---

## TOD:
The earliest ones we did were SUNDAY, SWEENEY and... COMPANY...

And not a word of this to Paul. Remember Paul? You know,

## ISA:
The man I′m gonna marry, but I'm not

I don′t know what you're waiting for -- A wedding?

Where ev'rybody promises fidelity forever

## ISA:
Which is maybe the most horrifying word I ever heard, and

## ISA:
Which is followed by a honeymoon, where suddenly he′ll realize he's

Saddled with a nut, and wanna kill me, which he should, so listen,

Go! Can't you go? Why is nobody listening?

Goodbye! Go and cry at some other person's wake.

## ISA:
If you′re quick, for a kick, you could pick up a christening,

## ISA:
But please, on my knees, there′s a human life at stake.

## ISA:
Look, I didn't want to have to tell you,

## ISA:
But I may be coming down with hepatitis

## ISA:
And I think I'm gonna faint,

So if you wanna see me faint, I′ll do it happily,

## KIM:
Oh, I think I like his shrink.

## TOD:
That song of course is from FALSETTOS, a show that holds a unique place in Latté Da history: 

---

It was the first BOOK musical that Peter and Denise produced together at the Bryan Lake Bowl in 1997.

---

## TOD:
And it was the first show playing exactly two years when Justin Lucero's artistic leadership began.

---

## TOD:
Justin, along with Associate Artistic Director Elissa Adams, and Managing Director Elisa Spencer-Kaplan, 

---

continues Latté Da's commitment to re-imagining classics, developing new work and---aren't we all thankful?--- tackling the Sondheim canon...

## BRADLEY (ad-libbing):
*ad libs, reminisces about having many memories of being on this stage, but would like to share a memory that comes from the 2016 gala, where he was a performer.*

---

## BRADLEY (ad-libbing):
*The Fund-A-Need that year was for fundraising the money for a down-payment for The Ritz building, and the goal was $40,000.*

---

## BRADLEY (ad-libbing):
*Everyone was shocked and touched that within a matter of a few minutes, the tally board has gone right past $40K and past $100,000, enough for the down payment and several mortgage payments.*

---

## BRADLEY (ad-libbing):
*And as a performer who is always putting his all his love for the audience, this was a moment where he saw the audience paying back with their love.*

---

## ISA (ad-libbing):
*ad libs, reminisces about starting out as an audience-admirer and eventually auditioning and being offered two roles last season.*

---

## ISA (ad-libbing):
*Her immigration status was precarious and she was unsure about how things would pan out, but even though she was new to the company, she felt so much support from the company.*

---

## ISA (ad-libbing):
*Her immigration status worked out and she was grateful to be able to perform, including in CINDERELLA.*

---

## ISA (ad-libbing):
*And speaking of CINDERELLA and SONDHEIM...*

He's a very smart prince,

class: song

## ISA:
He's a Prince who prepares.

---
class: song

## ISA:
Knowing this time I'd run from him,

---
class: song

## ISA:
He spread pitch on the stairs.

---
class: song

## ISA:
And I'm caught unawares.

---
class: song

## ISA:
And I thought: Well, he cares...

---
class: song

## ISA:
This is more than just malice.

---
class: song

## ISA:
Better stop and take stock

---
class: song

## ISA:
While you're standing here stuck

---
class: song

## ISA:
On the steps of the palace.

---
class: song

## ISA:
You think, what do you want?

---
class: song

## ISA:
You think, make a decision.

---
class: song

## ISA:
Why not stay and be caught?

---
class: song

## ISA:
You think, well it's a thought,

---
class: song

## ISA:
What would be his response?

---
class: song

## ISA:
But then what if he knew who you were

---
class: song

## ISA:
When you know that you're not

---
class: song

## ISA:
What he thinks that he wants?

---
class: song

## ISA:
And then what if you are

---
class: song

## ISA:
What a Prince would envision?

---
class: song

## ISA:
Although how can you know

---
class: song

## ISA:
Who you are 'til you know

---
class: song

## ISA:
What you want, which you don't?

---
class: song

## ISA:
So then, which do you pick:

---
class: song

## ISA:
Where you're safe, out of sight,

---
class: song

## ISA:
And yourself, but where ev'rything's wrong?

---
class: song

## ISA:
Or where ev'rything's right

---
class: song

## ISA:
And you know that you'll never belong?

---
class: song

## ISA:
And whichever you pick,

---
class: song

## ISA:
Do it quick,

---
class: song

## ISA:
'Cause you're starting to stick

---
class: song

## ISA:
To the steps of the palace.

---
class: song

## ISA:
It's your first big decision

---
class: song

## ISA:
The choice isn't easy to make.

---
class: song

## ISA:
To arrive at a ball is exciting and all,

---
class: song

## ISA:
Once you're there, though, it's scary.

---
class: song

## ISA:
And it's fun to deceive

---
class: song

## ISA:
When you know you can leave,

---
class: song

## ISA:
But you have to be wary.

---
class: song

## ISA:
There's a lot that\'s at stake,

---
class: song

## ISA:
But I've stalled long enough,

---
class: song

## ISA:
'Cause I\'m still standing stuck

---
class: song

## ISA:
In the stuff on the steps...

---
class: song

## ISA:
Better run along home

---
class: song

## ISA:
And avoid the collision.

---
class: song

## ISA:
Even though they don't care,

---
class: song

## ISA:
You'll be better off there

---
class: song

## ISA:
Where there\'s nothing to choose,

---
class: song

## ISA:
So there's nothing to lose.

---
class: song

## ISA:
So you pry up your shoes.

---
class: song

## ISA:
Then from out of the blue

---
class: song

## ISA:
And without any guide,

---
class: song

## ISA:
You know what your decision is,

---
class: song

## ISA:
Which is not to decide.

---
class: song

## ISA:
You'll just leave him a clue:

---
class: song

## ISA:
For example, a shoe.

---
class: song

## ISA:
And then see what he'll do.

---
class: song

## ISA:
Now it's he and not you

---
class: song

## ISA:
Who is stuck with a shoe,

---
class: song

## ISA:
In a stew, in the goo,

---
class: song

## ISA:
And you've learned something, too,

class: song

## ISA:
Something you never knew,

## ISA:
On the steps of the palace.

I am unworthy of your love,

## EVAN:
How can I turn your love to me?

I would come take you from your life...

I would come take you from your cell...

You would be queen to me, not wife...

Your love to me...

## EVAN:
Loving you is not a choice,

## EVAN:
It's who I am.

## EVAN:
Loving you is not a choice

---
class: song

## EVAN:
And not much reason to rejoice,

class: song

## EVAN:
But it gives me purpose,

class: song

## EVAN:
Gives me voice, to say to the world:

## EVAN:
This is why I live.

## EVAN:
You are why I live.

## EVAN:
Loving you is why I do

## EVAN:
The things I do.

## EVAN:
Loving you is not in my control.

## EVAN:
But loving you, I have a goal

class: song

## EVAN:
For what's left of my life...

## EVAN:
I will live,

## EVAN:
And I would die for you.

Send in the clowns.

Isn't it bliss?

Don't you approve?

One who can't move.

Where are the clowns?

## EVAN:
Send in the clowns.

Just when I'd stopped opening doors,

Finally knowing the one that I wanted was yours.

## EVAN:
Making my entrance again with my usual flair,

## EVAN:
Sure of my lines, no one is there.

## EVAN:
Don't you love farce?

## EVAN:
My fault, I fear.

## EVAN:
I thought that you'd want what I want.

Sorry, my dear.

## EVAN:
But where are the clowns?

Quick, send in the clowns.

Don't bother, they're here.

## EVAN:
Isn't it rich,

## EVAN:
Isn't it queer,

class: song

## EVAN:
Losing my timing this late in my career?

And where are the clowns?

## EVAN:
There ought to be clowns.

## EVAN:
Well, maybe next year...

## TOD:
Latté Da seasons have often been anchored by annual holiday offerings: 

---

ALL IS CALM, an emotional coming together of hearts and voices; 

---

CHRISTMAS AT THE LOCAL, a neighborly musical celebration of the poetry of Dylan Thomas and Maya Angelou; 

---

and A CHRISTMAS CAROLE PETERSEN, the other mother-show Peter, Denise and I put together.

---

## TOD:
A special holiday tribute to our mothers Jean, Gay and Carole. And all mothers.

---

## TOD:
Every year when I would come home for the holidays I would inform my parents 

---

that I would NOT be joining them for the Christmas Eve service at church.

---

## TOD:
Oh Jesus Christ! Son! It's Christmas Eve and we're going to church as a family!

---

## TOD:
And every year I would end up going. 

---

And every year I would watch a bright-eyed child light the advent candles, illuminating the darkened sanctuary.

---

## TOD:
And every year I would join in singing the traditional carols. 

---

And every year I was glad I was there.

---

## TOD:
And every year we'd go home and sit around the artificial tree and the chipped nativity and Mom would say...

---

## TOD:
Now you may each open ONE gift from your father and me because tomorrow we will open all our presents from S-A-N-T-A.

---

## TOD:
Mom, I'm a grown man. I still get presents from Santa.

---

## TOD:
Oh Toddy, please. Stop trying to be such a Scrooge. 

---

I know you never believed in Santa Claus.

---

## TOD:
Yeah. So why all the make-believe? Why the whole magic show?

---

## TOD:
Because. It brings me joy. Besides. Isn't that what you do in the theater? Make believe? Make magic?

---

## TOD:
And once again, she's right.

---

## DEIDRE:
We clap hands and welcome the Peace of Christmas.

## DEIDRE:
We beckon this good season to wait a while with us.

## DEIDRE:
We, Baptist and Buddhist, Methodist and Muslim, say come.

Implore you, to stay a while with us.

## BRADLEY:
So we may learn by your shimmering light

---

## BRADLEY:
How to look beyond complexion and see community.

## DEIDRE:
It is Christmas time, a halting of hate time.

---

## DEIDRE:
On this platform of peace, we can create a language

---

## DEIDRE:
To translate ourselves to ourselves and to each other.

## BRADLEY:
At this Holy Instant, we celebrate the Birth of Jesus Christ

---

## BRADLEY:
Into the great religions of the world.

## BRADLEY:
We jubilate the precious advent of trust.

## BRADLEY:
We shout with glorious tongues at the coming of hope.

## BRADLEY:
All the earth's tribes loosen their voices

## BRADLEY:
To celebrate the promise of Peace.

---

## DEIDRE:
We, Angels and Mortals, Believers and Non-Believers,

---

## DEIDRE:
Look heavenward and speak the word aloud. Peace.

---

## BRADLEY:
We look at our world and speak the word aloud. Peace.

---

## DEIDRE:
We look at each other, then into ourselves

---

## DEIDRE:
And we say without shyness or apology or hesitation.

## ALL:
