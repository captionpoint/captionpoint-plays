THE BEST CHRISTMAS PAGEANT EVER
]

---

## BETH:
The Herdmans were the worst kids in the whole history of the world. 

---

They lied and stole and smoked cigarettes , even the girls, and talked dirty and hit little kids and cussed their teachers 

---

and took the name of the Lord in vain and set fire to Fred Shoemaker's old broken-down tool house.

---

## ALICE:

And that's not all! Somebody sent five dozen doughnuts for the firemen and the Herdmans ate them all,

---

and what they couldn't eat they stuffed in their pockets and down the front of their shirts

---

## MAXINE:

And they wrote this really really dirty word on the back of Naomi Waddell's favorite turtle,

---

so now Naomi can't take it to the Y.M.C.A. pet show...her mother won't let her.

---

## ALICE:

What was the word?

---

Oh-h-h!

---

## MAXINE:

And that's not all! They did it with fluorescent paint, so it glows in the dark.

---

When you can't even see the turtle, you can still see the word.

---

## ALICE:

And they put a whole bunch of tadpoles in the school drinking fountain, and Miss Barnes swallowed two or three by mistake.

---

Somebody yelled, "Mildred, stop! You're drinking tadpoles!" ...but it was too late.

---

## MAXINE:

Did she get sick?

---

## ALICE:

Not right away.

---

## BETH:

And *that's* not all! There were six of them- Ralph, Imogene, Leroy, Claude, Ollie and Gladys-

---

and they went through the Woodrow Wilson school like those South American fish that strip your bones clean. 

---

And they went around town the same way--stealing things and tearing things up and whamming kids.

---

So it was hard to get away from them. There was only one safe place.

---

## CHARLIE:
(singing)
♪ SWEET HOUR OF PRAYER, SWEET HOUR OF PRAYER, <br>
BECAUSE THERE ARE NO HERDMANS THERE.

---


♪AND JESUS LOVES US, AS THEY SAY, <br>BECAUSE HE KEEPS THEM MILES AWAY. ♪

---

## BETH:
That's my little brother, Charlie. 

---

That's what he said when the Sunday school teacher asked what was his favorite thing about church. 

---

Charlie said, "No Herdmans." 

---

That made the teacher mad because all the other kids said nice things about God and Jesus and good feelings. 

---

But old Charlie told the real truth - No Herdmans!

---

## CHARLIE:
I don't care what everybody else said, that's what they really thought. 

---

All that other stuff is okay but the main good thing about church is that the Herdmans aren't there, ever.

---

## PAPA/NED:
That's not a very Christian sentiment, it seems to me. 

---

## DAD/GABE: 
It's a very practical sentiment. 

---

Charlie was black and blue all last year because he had to sit next to Leroy Herdman in school.

---

## PAPA/NED:
Is he the worst one? Leroy? 

---

## CHARLIE: 
They're all the worst one.

---

## BETH:
Ralph's the biggest, so if Ralph gets you…



---

## CHARLIE:
That doesn't make any difference. Gladys isn't big, but she's fast, and she's mean, and she bites.

---

## PAPA/NED:
I'm sorry I asked. Just stay away from all of them. 

---

## CHARLIE: 
That's what I said. Stay away from them. Go to church. 

---

## DAD/GABE: 
I'm glad to hear you feel that way.

---

## CHARLIE:
Why?

---

## DAD/GABE:
No arguments this year about the Christmas pageant. 

---

## CHARLIE:
I don't want to be a shepherd again!

---

## DAD/GABE:
Tell Mrs. Armstrong you want to be a Wise Man.

---

## CHARLIE:
I don't want to be in it!

---

## DAD/GABE:
Everybody's in it. Think how I'd feel sitting there on Christmas Eve, if my own children weren't in the pageant. 

---

Think how your father would feel.
You'd feel terrible, wouldn't you, Ned?

---

## PAPA/NED:
Well…actually, I didn't plan to go.

---



You know how crowded it always is, let the believers use my seat. I'll just stay home, put on my bathrobe, relax… 

---

There's never anything different about the Christmas pageant.

---

## DAD/GABE:
There's going to be something different this year. 

---

## PAPA/NED:
What?

---

## DAD/GABE:
Charlie's going to wear your bathrobe.

---

## PAPA/NED:
You just thought that up, Gabe. No.

---

## BETH:
Why don't you be Joseph? 

---

Elmer Hopkins'll pay you a dollar to be Joseph, Elmer's sick of being Joseph all the time just because his mother's the minister. 

---

Nobody wants to be Joseph.

---

## CHARLIE:
Nobody wants to be in it!

---

## PAPA/NED:
What are you going to be this year?

---

## BETH:
I'm always in the angel choir.

---

## PAPA/NED:
Well, why can't Charlie be in the angel choir?

---

## CHARLIE:
Because I can't sing!



---

## PAPA/NED:
From what I've heard in the past, that's not a serious drawback. 

---

Away In A Manger always sounds to me like a closetful of mice.

---

## CHARLIE:
What do you wear in the angel choir? 

---

## BETH:
Bedsheets.

---

## CHARLIE:
Oh, boy, some choice…a bathrobe or a bedsheet. 

---

Come on, let's go watch TV.

---

## DAD/GABE:
You know, Mrs. Armstrong works very hard to give everyone a lovely experience.

---

## BETH:
Oh, Dad, Mrs. Armstrong just likes to run things.

---

## DAD/GABE:
They're right, of course. 

---

She directs the pageant, she runs the potluck supper, she's chairman of the Bazaar… 

---

I think Helen Armstrong would preach the sermon if anyone would let her.

---

## PAPA/NED:
Is that George Armstrong's wife? 

---

## DAD/GABE:
Yes.

---

## PAPA/NED:
Well, maybe she'll try to manage the hospital, because that's where she is. 

---

I saw George at the drug store and he told me his wife broke her leg this morning… 

---

She'll be in traction for two weeks and laid up till the first of the year.

---

## DAD/GABE:
The first of the year! …Why, they'll have to cancel Christmas.

---

## PAPA/NED:
She's in charge of Christmas?

---

## DAD/GABE:
Well, she's in charge of the pageant, and she's in charge of the bazaar… 

---

I feel sorry for Helen, but who's going to do all those things?

---

## MRS. SLOCUM:
Yes, I'll take over the bazaar, Edna, if you'll do the potluck supper. 

---

I don't know what in the world we'll do about the pageant, unless… How about Gabe?

---

## MRS. CLARK:
I just can't, Edna. I've got company all Christmas week… How about Gabe?

---

## MRS. CLAUSING:
…How about Gabe? 

---

## MRS. MCCARTHY:
Hello… Gabe…?



---

## DAD/GABE:
Ned…

---

## PAPA/NED:
What?

---

## DAD/GABE:
I have to direct the Christmas pageant.

---

## PAPA/NED:
Does that mean I have to go?

---

## BETH:
Our Christmas pageant isn't what you'd call four- star entertainment. 

---

Mrs. Armstrong breaking her leg was the only unexpected thing that ever happened to it. 

---

It's always the same old Christmas story, and the same old carols, and the same old Mary and Joseph… 

---

and that's what my dad was stuck with…that, and Mrs. Armstrong.

---

## MRS. ARMSTRONG:
…Tell you again, Gabe, how important it is to give everyone a chance. 

---

Here's what I do-

---

I always start with Mary and I tell them we must choose our Mary carefully because Mary was the mother of Jesus…

---

## DAD/GABE:
I know, that, Helen.

---

## MRS. ARMSTRONG:
Yes, and then I tell them about Joseph, that he was God's choice to be Jesus' father. 

---

That's how I explain that. Frankly, I don't ever spend much time on Joseph because it's always Elmer Hopkins, and he knows all about Mary and Joseph…

---

## CHARLIE:
I thought Mrs. Armstrong was in traction. How can she talk on the phone if she's in traction?

---

## BETH:
What do you think traction is? 

---

## CHARLIE:
Like when they put you to sleep?

---

## PAPA/NED:
No such luck… Beth, we need salt and pepper… and napkins…

---

## MRS. ARMSTRONG:
…But I do explain about the Wise Men and the shepherds and how important they are. 

---

And I tell them, there are no small parts, only small actors. 

---

Remind the angel choir not to stare at the audience, and don't let them wear earrings and things like that. 

---

And don't let them wear clunky shoes or high heels. 

---

I just hope you don't have too many baby angels, Grace, because they'll be your biggest problem…

---

## PAPA/NED:
You will leave some for the rest of us, won't you, Charlie?

---

## CHARLIE:
I'm hungry. Leroy Herdman stole my lunch again.



---

## PAPA/NED:
How can you let him do that to you, day after day? 

---

## CHARLIE:
How can I stop him? …Where's the chicken?

---

## PAPA/NED:
Gabe, where's the chicken?

---

## DAD/GABE:
It's still in the oven.

---

## CHARLIE:
I'll get it.

---

## MRS. ARMSTRONG:
You'll have to get someone to push the baby angels on, otherwise they get in each other's way and bend their wings. 

---

Ned could do that, and he could keep an eye on the shepherds too. 

---

Oh, another thing about the angel choir. 

---

Don't let them wear lipstick. They think because it's a play… 

---

[doorbell rings]

---

## DAD/GABE:
Helen, I have to go. There's someone at my door.

---

## MRS. ARMSTRONG:
… That they have to wear lipstick, and it looks terrible. So tell them… 

---

[doorbell rings again]

---

## DAD/GABE:
Someone at my door, Helen. I'll talk to you later, 

---

[hangs up—doorbell again] <br>Yes… yes, I'm coming…

---

## PAPA/NED:
Lady, can you give me some supper?
I haven't had a square meal in three days.

---

## DAD/GABE:
Oh, for heaven's sake, it's you!

---

## PAPA/NED:
I was very lonely at the table.

---

## DAD/GABE:
Well, I guess Helen feels lonely at the hospital.

---

## PAPA/NED:
Not as long as the telephones are working.

---

## CHARLIE:
I'll bet she told you about no small parts, only small actors.

---

## BETH:
And getting someone to shove the baby angels on, and make the shepherds shut up.

---

## DAD/GABE:
Yes. She suggested your father.



---

## PAPA/NED:
Does that mean I have to go?

---

## MRS. ARMSTRONG:
And, Gabe, don't use just anybody's baby for Jesus…get a quiet one. 

---

Better yet, get two if you can…then if one turns out to be fussy, you can always switch them…

---

## BETH:
My dad didn't pay much attention to Mrs. Armstrong. 

---

She said Mrs. Armstrong was stuck in the hospital with nothing to do but think up problems, and there weren't going to be any problems. 

---

Of course, Mother didn't count on the Herdmans. 

---

That was Charlie's fault.

---

## CHARLIE:
Hey, Leroy, you give me back my lunch! 

---

## LEROY:
Sure, kid, here.

---

## CHARLIE:
You stole my dessert again! 

---

## LEROY:
How do you know?

---

## CHARLIE:
Because it isn't here. 

---

## LEROY:
What was it?

---

## CHARLIE:
Two Twinkies.

---

## LEROY:
That's right. That's what it was.

---

## CHARLIE:
Hey, Leroy! You think it's so great to steal my dessert every day and you know what? 

---

I don't care if you steal my dessert. I'll even give you my dessert. 

---

I get all the dessert I want in Sunday school.

---

## LEROY:
Oh, yeah? What kind of dessert?

---

## CHARLIE:
All kinds. Chocolate cake and candy bars and cookies…and Twinkies and brownies. 

---

We get refreshments all the time, all we want.

---

## LEROY:
You're a liar.

---

## CHARLIE:
…And ice cream, and doughnuts and cupcakes and…

---

## LEROY:
Who gives it to you? 

---

## CHARLIE:
Uh…the minister.

---

## LEROY:
Why? Is she crazy?

---

## CHARLIE:
No… I think she's rich.



---

## LEROY:
…Sunday school, huh?

---

## BETH:
That was the wrong thing to tell Herdmans…

---

and, sure enough, the very next Sunday there they were in Sunday school, just in time to hear about the Christmas pageant…

---

## IMOGENE:
What's a pageant?

---

## ALICE:
It's a play.

---

## IMOGENE:
Like on TV? What's it about?

---

## ALICE:
It's about Jesus.

---

## IMOGENE:
Everything here is.

---

## ALICE:
And it's about Mary. Mostly, it's about Mary.

---

## IMOGENE:
Who's Mary?

---

## ALICE:
I am… Well, probably I am. I know the part.

---

## DAD/GABE:
Come on, Beth… Charlie, you and Elmer come. 

---

Now, this won't take very long if you all settle down… 

---

Today we're going to decide who will play the main roles in our Christmas pageant, but of course everyone will have an important part to play. 

---

You know what Mrs. Armstrong always tells you there are no small parts, only small actors. 

---

Isn't that what Mrs. Armstrong always says?

---

## ELMER:
That's what she always says, but she never says what it means. 

---

## DAD/GABE:
Don't you know what it means?

---

## BEVERLY:
I know what it means. It means that the short kids have to be in the front row of the angel choir or else nobody can see them. 

---

## DAD/GABE:
Well…not exactly. It really means that the littlest baby angel is just as important as Mary.

---

## ALICE:
I don't think anyone is as important as Mary.

---

## BETH:
Well, naturally that's what you think, Alice. I think Jesus is more important.

---

## BEVERLY:
I still think it means short kids have to be in the front row…

---

## DAD/GABE:
Girls, girls! …Everyone is important.. Mary, Jesus, and the short kids. 

---

Now, is everyone here? Juanita, will you just step out in the hall and see if anyone else is coming? 

---

Now you little children will be our angels, so please remind your mothers that you'll need bedsheets…

---



People in the angel choir will need bedsheets too, and if any of you have old bathrobes at home… Now, what's the matter?

---

## GLADYS:
Where’s the cookies.

---

## HOBIE:
Herdmans.

---

## DAD/GABE:
Well, let's make some room there, for the Herdmans. 

---

## DAD/GABE:
Now what happened to Juanita?

---

## GLADYS:
I think she went home. I think she got sick.

---

## DAD/GABE:
Did she say she was sick?

---

## GLADYS:
She just left. All I did was, I just said "Hi, Juanita”… and she just left.

---

## DAD/GABE:
I see. Well, will someone please tell Juanita about the rehearsals? 

---

…The next four Wednesdays, after school. Plan to be here for everyone.

---

## ELMER:
What if we get sick?

---

## DAD/GABE:
You won't get sick. Of course, Mary and Joseph must absolutely come to every rehearsal…

---

## ELMER:
What if they get sick?

---

## DAD/GABE:
They won't get sick either, Elmer.

---

## ELMER:
Well, Juanita got sick and we didn't even start yet.

---

## DAD/GABE:
We don't know that Beverly got sick. 

---

Now, I want you to think about Mary… We all know what kind of person Mary was. 

---

She was quiet and gentle and kind, and the girl who plays Mary should try to be that kind of person. 

---

Who would like to volunteer for that part? Did you have a question, Imogene?

---

## IMOGENE:
No, I want to be Mary…and Ralph, over there, he wants to be Joseph.

---

## RALPH:
Yeh, right.

---

## DAD/GABE:
Oh. Well… 

---

Well, I'll just make a list of volunteers for these parts and then we'll all decide who it should be. 

---

Ralph Herdman. 

---

Now, who else would like to be Joseph? 

---

…Did you raise your hand, Elmer?

---

## ELMER:
No.

---

## DAD/GABE:
Just raise your hands, please, any volunteers… 

---

Any of you shepherds? Very well… 

---

Ralph Herdman will be our Joseph. Now, Imogene has volunteered to be…Mary.

---

I'll just write that down… 

---

What other names can I put on my list? 

---

…Janet? …Roberta? 

---

…Alice, don't you want to volunteer?

---

## ALICE:
No, I don't want to.

---

## GLADYS:
I'll be Mary!

---

## IMOGENE:
Shut up, Gladys. I'm already Mary. You be a Wise Man. 

---

## DAD/GABE:
Well, the Wise Men are usually boys, Of course,they don't have to be, and we could…

---

## LEROY:
I'll be a Wise Man!

---

## OLLIE:
Me, too. Claude, you wanta be a Wise Man? Raise your hand. 

---

## CLAUDE:
What's a Wise Man?

---

## RALPH:
Just raise your hand!

---

## GLADYS:
What's left to be?

---

## IMOGENE:
Some angel.

---

## GLADYS:
I'll be that. What is it?

---

## DAD/GABE:
It's the Angel of the Lord, who brought the good news to the shepherds.

---



There, we do have some volunteers after all! 

---

Yes, Hobie, would you like to be a Wise Man?

---

## HOBIE:
No, I just wanted to say I can't be a shepherd. We're going to Philadelphia.

---

## DAD/GABE:
Why didn't you say so before?

---

## HOBIE:
I just remembered.

---

## DIANE:
My mother doesn't want me to be a shepherd.



---

## MOTHER:
Why not?

---

## DIANE:
I don't know. She just said, don't be a shepherd.

---

## CHARLIE:
I'm not going to be a shepherd!

---

## DAD/GABE:
Oh, yes, you are! …What's the matter with all of you?

---

## ELMER:
I don't want to be a shepherd… Gladys Herdman hits too hard! 

---

## DAD/GABE:
Why, Gladys isn't going to hit anybody! 

---

The Angel of the Lord just visits the shepherds in the fields and tells them Jesus is born.

---

## ELMER:
And hits them!

---

## DAD/GABE:
Elmer, that's ridiculous, and I don't want to hear another word about it, from anyone. 

---

No shepherds may quit…or get sick. 

---

Now that's all for today, boys and girls, and you can go… 

---

But I expect to see everyone here on Wednesday at 6:30!

---

## ELMER:
Can I play my saxophone? 

---

## DAD/GABE:
If you be a shepherd.

---

## GLADYS:
I’m the angel of the Lord!

---

## DAD/GABE:
Alice, what's wrong with you? Why in the world didn't you raise your hand?

---

## ALICE:
I don't know.

---

## DAD/GABE:
You don't know! Alice, I expected you…

---

## DIANE:
Mrs. Bradley! Get Gladys offa me! 

---

## DAD/GABE:
…To volunteer. Don't you want to be Mary?

---

## DIANE:
Mrs. Bradley!!

---

## BETH:
Oh, come on, Alice! I don't know…!

---

## ALICE:
I didn't dare raise my hand. Imogene would have killed me! 

---

She said, "I'm going to be Mary in this play, and if you open your mouth or raise your hand you'll wish you didn't." 

---

And I said, "I'm always Mary in the Christmas pageant.” 

---

And she said, “go ahead then, and next spring when the pussywillows come out I'll stick a pussywillow so far down your ear that nobody can reach it…

---

and it'll sprout there and grow and grow, 

---

and you'll spend the rest of your life with a pussywillow bush growing out of your ear!"



---

## BETH:
You know she wouldn't do that!

---

## ALICE:
She would too! Herdmans will do anything. 

---

You just watch, they'll do something terrible and ruin the whole pageant…

---

and it's all your father's fault!

---

## MRS. MCCARTHY:
Jane? …Edna McCarthy. 

---

Did you hear about the… 

---

Well, it must be Gabe's fault somehow! 

---

How else would the six of them end up in a Christmas pageant, when they ought to be in jail!

---



## MRS.SLOCUM:
Vera? …Irma Slocum. 

---

I just heard that Imogene Herdman is going to be Mary in the Christmas pageant, and I… 

---

Is that a fact? All six of them? 

---

Vera, I live next door to that outfit and I'd rather live next door to a zoo. 

---

Has Gabe gone crazy?

---

## MRS. ARMSTRONG:
Where did they come from? Who let them in? Imogene Herdman! 

---

…What kind of a child is that, to be Mary the Mother of Jesus? 

---

Where was Reverend Hopkins, I'd like to know… 

---

She was what? 

---

…Visiting shut-ins! Well, I'm shut-in, and she wasn't visiting me!

---

## MRS. MCCARTHY:
I said, why don't you let them hand out programs at the door? 

---

Gabe said we never have programs for the pageant, but I said…

---

## MRS. SLOCUM:
…Better nail down the church and lock up the silver service and hide the collection plates before they clean them out…

---

## MRS. ARMSTRONG:
What was the matter with Gabe? Couldn't he have sent them away? 

---

Tell them to go home? Oh, I feel responsible… 

---

If I'd been up and around this never would have happened!

---

## DAD/GABE:
…"If I'd been up and around, this never would have happened!" Well, let me tell you…

---

## PAPA/NED:
Don't tell me, I'm on your side… 

---

The car's over there. 

---

## DAD/GABE:
Helen Armstrong is not the only woman alive who can run a Christmas pageant! 

---

I made up my mind just to do the best I could under the circumstances, but now I'm going to make this the best Christmas pageant ever, 

---

and I'm going to do it with the Herdmans! 

---

After all, they raised their hands and nobody else did, and I don't care…

---

## PAPA/NED:
Good for you, Gabe, the car's over there… 

---

## DAD/GABE:
And you're going to help me!

---

## PAPA/NED:
Does that mean…



---

## DAD/GABE:
You have to go!

---

## DAD/GABE:
The inn is back here, offstage…and the shepherds come in and gather around the manger…

---

## LEROY:
Where'd all the shepherds come from, anyway?

---

## CLAUDE:
What's an inn?

---

## ELMER:
It's like a motel, where people go to spend the night.

---

## CLAUDE:
What people? Jesus?

---

## ALICE:
Oh, honestly! Jesus wasn't even born yet. Mary and Joseph went there.

---

## RALPH:
Why?

---

## ELMER:
To pay their taxes.

---

## OLLIE:
At a motel?!

---

## IMOGENE:
Shut up, Ollie! Everybody shut up! I want to hear him. 

---

Begin at the beginning.

---

## DAD/GABE:
The beginning…?

---

## IMOGENE:
The beginning of the play. 

---

What happens first?

---

## DAD/GABE:
Imogene, this is the Christmas story from the Bible… 

---

Haven't you ever heard the Christmas story from the Bible? 

---

…Well, that's what this Christmas pageant is, so I'd better read it to you. 

---

## BETH:
I don't believe that, do you? That they never heard the Christmas story?

---

## ALICE:
Why not? They don't even know what a Bible is, and they never went to church in their whole life, 

---

till your dumb brother told them we got refreshments. 

---

Now we have to waste all this time for nothing.

---

## DAD/GABE:
All right now. There went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed…

---

## DAD/GABE:
…And Joseph went up from Galilee with Mary his wife, being great with child…

---

## RALPH:
Pregnant! She was pregnant!



---

## DAD/GABE:
All right now, that's enough. 

---

We all know that Mary was pregnant and Joseph went up from Galilee with Mary his wife, being great with child…

---

And it came to pass, while they were there, that the days were accomplished that she should be delivered, and she brought forth her firstborn son…

---

## ALICE:
I don't think it's very nice to say Mary was pregnant. 

---

## BETH:
Well, she was.

---

## ALICE:
I don't think your father should say Mary was pregnant. 

---

It's better to say 'great with child'. 

---

I'm not supposed to talk about people being pregnant, especially in church.

---

## DAD/GABE:
…And wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.

---

## IMOGENE:
My God! They didn't have room for Jesus?

---

## DAD/GABE:
Well, nobody knew the baby was going to be Jesus.

---

## IMOGENE:
Didn't Mary know? Didn't he know? 

---

What was the matter with Joseph, that he didn't tell them? 

---

Her pregnant and everything…

---

## LEROY:
What's a manger? Some kind of bed?

---

## DAD/GABE:
Well, they didn't have a bed in the barn, so Mary had to use whatever there was. 

---

What would you do if you had a new baby and no bed to put the baby in?

---

## IMOGENE:
We put Gladys in a bureau drawer.

---

## DAD/GABE:
Well, there you are. You didn't have a bed for Gladys, so you had to use… something else.

---

## RALPH:
Oh, we had a bed…only Ollie was still in it and he wouldn't get out. 

---

He didn't like Gladys,remember how you didn't like Gladys?

---

## BETH:
That was pretty smart of Ollie, not to like Gladys right off the bat.

---

## DAD/GABE:
Anyway… A manger is a large wooden feeding trough for animals.

---

## CLAUDE:
What were the wadded up clothes? 

---

## DAD/GABE:
The what?

---

## CLAUDE:
It said in there…she wrapped him in wadded up clothes.



---

## DAD/GABE:
Swaddling clothes. People used to wrap babies up very tightly in big pieces of material, to make them feel cozy…

---

## IMOGENE:
You mean they tied him up and put him in a feedbox? Where was the Child Welfare?

---

## GLADYS:
The Child Welfare's at our house every five minutes!

---

## ALICE:
There wasn't any child welfare in Bethlehem!

---

## IMOGENE:
I'll say there wasn't!

---

## DAD/GABE:
…And there were shepherds, keeping watch over their flocks by night. 

---

And lo, the Angel of the Lord came upon them, and the Glory of…

---

## GLADYS:
Shazam!

---

## DAD/GABE:
What?

---

## GLADYS:
Out of the black night, with horrible vengeance, the Mighty Marvo…

---

## DAD/GABE:
I don't know what you're talking about, Gladys.

---

## GLADYS:
The Mighty Marvo, in Amazing Comics…out of the black night, with horrible vengeance…

---

## DAD/GABE:
This is the angel of the Lord, who comes to the shepherds…

---

## GLADYS:
Out of nowhere, right? In the black night, right?

---

## DAD/GABE:
Well… In a way…

---

## GLADYS:
Shazam…!

---

## DAD/GABE:
Now when Jesus was born, there came Wise Men from the East, bearing gifts of gold and frankincense…

---

## CLAUDE:
What's that?

---

## DAD/GABE:
…And myrrh…

---

## OLLIE:
What's that?

---

## DAD/GABE:
They were…special things. Spices, and precious oils… 

---

## IMOGENE:
Oil! What kind of a present is oil? We get better presents from the welfare!



---

## LEROY:
Were they the welfare? The Wise Men?

---

## DAD/GABE:
They were kings and they were sent…

---

## IMOGENE:
Well, it's about time somebody important showed up! 

---

If they're kings, they can get the baby out of the barn, and tell the innkeeper where to get off!

---

## DAD/GABE:
…They were sent by Herod, who was…

---

well, he was the main king, and he wanted to find Jesus and have him put to death.

---

## IMOGENE:
My God! He just got born! They're gonna kill a baby?

---

## RALPH:
Who's Herod in this play?

---

## DAD/GABE:
Herod isn't in the play.

---

## LEROY:
He's out to kill the baby, and he isn't even in the play? 

---

## DAD/GABE:
Well, somebody better be Herod. 

---

Let Charlie be Herod, and he says, go get me that baby. 

---

And they say okay, because he's a king and all…

---

## OLLIE:
But then they don't do it! They go back and get Herod! 

---

## CHARLIE:
I'm not going to be Herod!

---

## DAD/GABE:
No one is going to be Herod!

---

## CLAUDE:
No… Joseph gets the shepherds together and they go wipe out Herod!

---

## CHARLIE:
See? They're going to put one in, and it's going to be me, and I'll get killed!

---

## DAD/GABE:
Forget about Herod! There's no Herod!

---

## IMOGENE:
And I run away with the baby till the fight's over!

---

## RALPH:
Somebody ought to fix the innkeeper… 

---

Gladys, you wipe out the innkeeper!

---

## GLADYS:
I can't! …I'm an angel!

---

## IMOGENE:
Well, I wouldn't just hang around out in the barn. 

---

I'd go get a room.

---

## CLAUDE:
She said there wasn't any room.



---

## IMOGENE:
Then I'd throw somebody out. 

---

I'd tell them I've got this baby and it's the middle of winter…so either get out or move over.

---

## RALPH:
I'd go after Ol' Herod.

---

## LEROY:
I'd send the angel after him. 

---

She could just point her electric finger and turn him into a pile of ashes.

---

## GLADYS:
Yeh! …Zap!

---

## OLLIE:
What's the name of this play? He never said.

---

## CLAUDE:
Christmas pageant.

---

## OLLIE:
That's no name. That's what it is.

---

## GLADYS:
I know a name! …I know a name! I'd call it… 

---

Revenge at Bethlehem!

---

## BETH:
Revenge at Bethlehem! The Herdmans thought the Christmas story came right out of the F.B.I. files! 

---

At least they picked out the right villain-it was Herod they wanted to gang up on and not the baby Jesus. 

---

But the baby Jesus quit the pageant anyway. 

---

It was supposed to be Eugene Slocum, but Mrs. Slocum said she wasn't going to let Imogene Herdman get her hands on him. 

---

So we didn't have a baby Jesus, and that bothered my dad. 

---

He kept trying to scratch up a baby…even at the last rehearsal.

---



What do you keep writing in that book?

---

## ALICE:
It's…like a diary.

---

## BETH:
It is not. It's all about the Herdmans. 

---

Imogene curses and swears all the time. 

---

Ralph talks about sexy things. Mr. Bradley… 

---

…Mr. Bradley called Mary pregnant… 

---

Gladys Herdman drinks communion wine… It isn't wine, it's grape juice.

---

## ALICE:
I don't care what it is, she drinks it. 

---

I've seen her three times with her mouth all purple. 

---

They steal, too-if you shake the birthday bank it doesn't make a sound, because they stole all the pennies out of it. 

---

And every time you go in the ladies' room the whole air is full of thick blue smoke, 

---

and Imogene Herdman is sitting there in the Mary costume, smoking cigars!

---

## BETH:
And you wrote all this down? What for?

---

## ALICE:
For my mother and Reverend Hopkins and the Ladies Aid Society and anybody else 

---

who wants to know what happened when the whole Christmas pageant turns out to be a big mess!



---

## DAD/GABE:
All right, everyone, let's get quiet. Beth, will you and Alice please come up here so we can get started. 

---

Now, this is our last rehearsal, and we're going to…

---

## MRS. MCCARTHY:
Gabe, I just wanted to tell you that we're all back in the kitchen making applesauce cake. 

---

We'll try not to bother you… I guess this is your dress rehearsal.

---

## DAD/GABE:
It's supposed to be… 

---

Oh, Edna…didn't I hear that your niece had a baby a month or so ago? A little girl?

---

## MRS. MCCARTHY:
Yes! She's five weeks old, and…

---

## DAD/GABE:
Well, I wonder how it would be if I were to call your niece and ask if we could borrow…

---

## MRS, MCCARTHY:
Gabe… No! 

---

I could make up some lie and tell you the baby's sick or cranky or something, 

---

but the truth is that she's perfectly healthy and happy and beautiful, 

---

and we all want her to stay that way. 

---

So we're certainly not going to hand her over to Imogene Herdman. 

---

Sorry, Gabe.

---

## DIANE:
Mrs. Bradley, you can have my little brother for Jesus. 

---

## DAD/GABE:
I didn't know you had a new baby, Diane.

---

## DIANE:
He's not new. He's four years old, but he's double-jointed and he could probably scrunch up.

---

## DAD/GABE:
Well, I don't think…

---

## IMOGENE:
I'll get us a baby.

---

## DAD/GABE:
How can you do that?

---

## IMOGENE:
There's always two or three babies in carriages outside the supermarket. I'll get one of them.

---

## DAD/GABE:
Imogene! You can't just walk off with somebody's baby! 

---

…I guess we'll forget about a baby. We'll just use the doll.

---

## IMOGENE:
Yeh. That's better, anyway… A doll can't bite you 

---

## DAD/GABE:
And, Imogene…you know Mary didn't wear earrings.

---

## IMOGENE:
I have to wear these. 

---

I got my ears pierced and if I don't keep something in them, they'll grow together.



---

## DAD/GABE:
Well, they won't grow together in an hour and a half. What did the doctor tell you to do?

---

## IMOGENE:
What doctor?

---

## DAD/GABE:
Well, who pierced your ears?

---

## IMOGENE:
Gladys.

---

## ALICE:
She probably did it with an ice pick. 

---

I'll bet Imogene's ears turn black and fall off.

---

## DAD/GABE:
Well, we'll find something smaller… 

---

Now, is that your costume? Is that what you're going to wear? 

---

You're all supposed to have your costumes on today.

---

## ANGEL CHOIR MEMBER DOTTIE:
I can't find my halo.

---

## ANGEL CHOIR MEMBER JUANITA:
My wings got all bent.

---

## ANGEL CHOIR MEMBER DORIS:
Juanita's got my robe.

---

## ANGEL CHOIR MEMBER SHIRLEY:
My mother doesn't have any white sheets. Can I wear a sheet with balloons on it?

---

## HOBIE:
I haven't got any costume. I was never a shepherd before. 

---

## CHARLIE:
You have to wear your father's bathrobe. That's what I have to do.

---

## HOBIE:
He hasn't got a bathrobe.

---

## CHARLIE:
What does he hang around the house in?

---

## HOBIE:
His underwear.

---

## DAD/GABE:
All right…pretend you're wearing costumes.

DAVID. Are we going through the whole thing?

---

## DAD/GABE:
Yes, of course…

---

But first we're going to practice just the entrances, so all of you go where you're supposed to be, 

---

and we'll start with the shepherds. Just read the last few words, Maxine. 

---

## MAXINE:
…Shepherds keeping watch over their flocks by night… 

---

## DAD/GABE:
Music… Shepherds! Quiet feet,quiet feet.

---

## ELMER:
Can I play my saxophone?



---

## DAD/GABE:
No. Karen!

---

## MAXINE:
And an Angel of the Lord appeared to them and…

---

## GLADYS:
Shazam!

---

## DAD/GABE:
No, Gladys!

---

## GLADYS:
Out of the black night…

---

## DAD/GABE:
No! Go on, Maxine.

---

## MAXINE:
..A multitude of the heavenly host…

---

## DAD/GABE:
Music… Angels! Thank you, Karen!

---

## DAD/GABE:
Music… Wise Men! Wise Men!

---

## LEROY, CLAUDE, & OLLIE: 
Go, Go, Go! Where do I go now?

---

## IMOGENE:
I've got the baby here… Don't touch him! I named him Jesus!

---

## DAD/GABE:
No, no, no! You don't say…Anything! Mary doesn't say anything. 

---

No one says anything! Mary and Joseph…

---

## IMOGENE:
Let go! …Give it back!

---

## DAD/GABE:
…Make a lovely picture for us to look at while we think about Christmas and what it means! 

---

…Now, put the doll back. 

---

## IMOGENE:
I don't get to say anything… Some angel tells me what to call the baby… 

---

I would have named him Bill.

---

## ALICE:
Oh, what a terrible thing to say!

---

## RALPH:
What angel was that? There's angels all over the place. 

---

Was that Gladys?

---

## DAD/GABE:
No, Gladys brought the good news to the shepherds. 

---

## GLADYS:
Yeh… Unto you a child is born!

---

## IMOGENE:
Unto me! Not them, me! I'm the one that had the baby! 

---

## DAD/GABE:
No, no, no. That just means that Jesus belongs to everybody. Unto all of us a child is born.

---

## IMOGENE:
Why didn't they let Mary name her own baby? 

---

What did that angel do, just walk up and say "Name him Jesus"?



---

## DAD/GABE:
Yes.

---

## ALICE:
I know what the angel said. She said… 

---

“His name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace."

---

## IMOGENE:
My God! He'd never get out of the first grade if he had to write all that!

---

## MAXINE:
Mr. Bradley, what should I do? Should I start over? 

---

## DAD/GABE:
Five minutes, Maxine. Five minutes!

---

## DOTTIE & JUANITA:
Are we done?

---

## BETH:
We never did start over. And we never did go through the whole thing.

---

## BETH:
The five minutes turned into fifteen minutes, and Imogene Herdman spent the whole time smoking cigarettes in the ladies' room. 

---

Then Mrs. McCarthy went to the ladies' room and saw all the smoke and called the fire department. 

---

And they came…right away.

---

## MRS. MCCARTHY:
Fire! There's a fire! 

---

[Fire Alarm]

---

## FIREMAN:
Get the kids out of here now!

---

## FIREMAN:
Can someone get this kid off of me?

---

## BETH:
They cleared everybody out of the building and dragged a fire hose through the church looking for a fire to put out…

---

but the only one they found was in the kitchen… 

---

All the applesauce cake burned up. 

---

Of course all the ladies were mad about that, and Mrs. McCarthy was mad, and my dad was mad.

---

## DAD/GABE:
Why in the world did you call the fire department about a little smoke?

---

## MRS. MCCARTHY:
It was a lot of smoke. The ladies' room was full of thick smoke.

---

## DAD/GABE:
It couldn't have been. 

---

You just got excited. 

---

And now look-the church is full of firemen and the street is full of baby angels crying 

---

and shepherds climbing all over the fire truck and half the neighborhood…! 

---

Didn't you know it was cigarette smoke?

---

## MRS. MCCARTHY:
No, I didn't know it was cigarette smoke! 

---

I don't expect to find cigar smoke in the ladies' room of the church!



---

## BETH:
Alice Wendleken's mother was mad, too, and the whole Ladies' Aid Society was mad..

---

and Reverend Hopkins said she didn't know what to think.

---

## REVEREND HOPKINS:
I've been on the telephone all day, and I can't make heads or tails of it. 

---

Some people say they set fire to the ladies' room. 

---

Some people say they set fire to the kitchen. 

---

Vera Wendleken says all they do is talk about sex and underwear.

---

## DAD/GABE:
That was Hobie Clark talking about underwear.

---

And they didn't set fire to anything. 

---

The only fire was in the kitchen, where the applesauce cake burned up.

---

## REVEREND HOPKINS:
Well, the whole church is in an uproar. 

---

I don't know… Jesus said, "Suffer the little children to come unto me," but I'm not sure he meant the Herdmans… 

---

Gabe, don't you think we should cancel the pageant?

---

## DAD/GABE:
I'll bet that was Helen Armstrong's idea.

---

## REVEREND HOPKINS:
We could blame it on the fire…makes a good excuse.

---

## DAD/GABE:
I'll bet that was Edna McCarthy's idea.

---

## REVEREND HOPKINS:
Every one seems to think it's going to be a…a…

---

## DAD/GABE:
Disaster? Well, they're wrong! 

---

…It's going to be the best Christmas pageant we ever had!

---

## REVEREND HOPKINS:
But, Gabe,.. I don't think anyone will come to see it!

---

## BETH:
I didn't think so, either, and neither did Charlie… 

---

but we were wrong. On Christmas Eve the church was jammed full. 

---

Everybody came…to see what the Herdmans would do.

---

## DAD/GABE:
Wait till I turn the lights on. 

---

Now, watch your step.

---

## PAPA/NED:
I can't even see where I'm going. 

---

I don't know what in the world you expect to do with this thing…

---

## DAD/GABE:
I thought it might look like a palm tree. 

---

I see now that it doesn't… 

---

Oh, I don't have any idea what's going to happen tonight! 

---

We've never once gone through the whole thing, 

---

and the Herdmans still think it's some kind of spy story. 

---

It may be the first Christmas pageant in history 

---

where Joseph and the Wise Men get in a fight and Mary runs away with the baby.


---


Where are the kids?

---

## PAPA/NED:
All the kids in the world are down in the basement, putting on bedsheets.

---

## DAD/GABE:
I mean our kids. 

---

## BETH: 
We're here.

---

## DAD/GABE:
Well, go get your costumes on. It's getting late.

---

## BETH:
It's just going to be awful, you know. 

---

They look like trick or treat-all dirty and fastened together with safety pins and wearing their moldy old sneakers… 

---

Mary and Joseph, I mean. They look like refugees or something.

---

## PAPA/NED:
Well…that's what they were… 

---

Mary and Joseph. They were refugees, in a way. They were a long way from home, didn't have any place to stay, didn't know anybody. 

---

They were probably cold and hungry and tired…and messy.

---

## CHARLIE:
I don't know about cold and hungry, but they're sure messy.

---

## DAD/GABE:
Oh, dear… Do you think I should…

---

## PAPA/NED:
I think you worry too much. Now…

---

I'm going to push baby angels onstage, and I'm going to hand out shepherds' crooks and then push them onstage… 

---

When do I do all that?

---

## DAD/GABE:
Just follow this script.

---

## PAPA/NED:
Baby angels…shepherds…Wise Men… 

---

It doesn't seem to say here where the fire engines come in.

---

## DAD/GABE:
Oh-h-h! 

---

## PAPA/NED: 
Just kidding.

---

## JUANITA & DOTTIE:
When do we start? Is this the real deal?

---

## DAD/GABE:
Is everyone here? …Beth, I want you and Alice down front where you can help the baby angels. 

---

Will you all come on stage please? I just want to see how you look. 

---

Gladys, where's your halo?

---

## GLADYS:
Our cat buried it… 

---

Listen, I think I ought to say something besides the baby came. 

---

Why would they all get up and tear off after some baby they don't even know? 

---

I ought to tell them it's Jesus, and I ought to tell them where he is.



---

## DAD/GABE:
No, Gladys. You tell them, "Unto you a child is born"… 

---

And that's all you tell them. 

---

Now, let's all go backstage, and try to be quiet while people are coming. And good luck!

---

## ALICE:
Mr. Bradley, actors don't say good luck, actors say break a leg.

---

## DAD/GABE:
Yes, I know that, Alice, but in this case I don't think… 

---

For those of you who don't know what that means, it's just a theatrical saying. 

---

It doesn't really mean break a leg…your own or anyone else's!

---

## DAD/GABE:
And, Imogene, try to remember that that's a baby. And, for tonight anyway, it's the baby Jesus.

---

Irma, this was the best Christmas pageant we ever had, and I'm not sure why, but I think it was them. 

---

Could that be?

---

## MRS. SLOCUM:
Oh, I always get weepy about the pageant.

---

 Guess it's the children and the carols and all… 

---

But you're right, this was the best one…

---

and it should have been the worst.

---

## MRS. MCCARTHY:
There was just something…different. 

---

## MRS. SLOCUM:
Well, the Angel of the Lord was different!

---

## MRS. MCCARTHY:
Yes, but you know, I liked that! 

---

Had lots of spirit. 

---

Sometimes you can't even hear the Angel of the Lord, I must find Gabe, and tell him…

---

## MRS. SLOCUM:
I just wish now that I'd let him have Eugene to be the baby Jesus.

---

## MRS. MCCARTHY:
Who was the baby Jesus? 

---

## MRS. SLOCUM:
Why, it was a doll.



---

## MRS. MCCARTHY:
Oh, I don't think so, Irma. That was no doll. 

---

## MRS. SLOCUM: 
Well… It did seem real.

---

## BETH:
It did seem real, as if it might have happened just that way. 

---

We all thought the pageant was about Jesus, but that was only part of it. 

---

It was about a new baby, and his mother and father who were in a whole lot of trouble-

---

-no money, no place to go, no doctor, nobody they knew. 

---

And then, arriving from the East-like my uncle from New Jersey-some rich friends.

---

## BETH:
Because of the Herdmans, it was a whole new story—— 

---

Imogene, burping the baby, and the Wise Men bringing such a sensible present. 

---

After all, they couldn't eat frankincense! 

---

And even Gladys-"He's in the barn. Go see him"… 

---

So the shepherds didn't have to stumble around all over the countryside.

---



But I guess it wasn't like that for Imogene. 

---

For her, the Christmas pageant turned out to be all wonder and mystery, 

---

as if she just caught on to what Christmas was all about. 

---

When it was over we had a party in the basement, but the Herdmans didn't stay. 

---

They didn't have any cocoa and they didn't walk off with all the cookies, and they wouldn't even take their candy canes.

---

## PAPA/NED:
I guess that's about it. Any kids left downstairs? 

---

## DAD/GABE: 
No, everyone's gone… You know you have your bathrobe on. 

---

You aren't going to wear it, are you?

---

## PAPA/NED:
Why not? Maybe people will think I was a shepherd. 

---

I wouldn't mind being taken for a shepherd in this Christmas pageant.

---

## CHARLIE:
Yes, you would! When it was over some lady came up and hugged me because I was a shepherd… 

---

Should I bring this ham?

---

## DAD/GABE:
It's the Herdmans' ham from their welfare basket…but they wouldn't take it back. 

---

Leroy said, “It's a present. You don't take back a present.”

---

## CHARLIE:
Leroy said that? They must hate ham. 

---

## BETH:
You and Alice Wendleken!

---

## PAPA/NED:
…What about the lights?

---

## DAD/GABE:
They're on a timer. They go off at midnight.

---

## PAPA/NED:
That's not far away…It's almost Christmas.



---

## DAD/GABE:
…Almost Christmas, kids.

---

## BETH:
…Almost Christmas, Charlie.

---

[Church Bell Chimes]

---

## GLADYS:
(offstage) Hey! …Hey, unto you a child is born!

---

[Music: Joy To The World]

---

## ALL:

♪JOY TO THE WORLD, THE LORD IS COME!
LET EARTH RECEIVE HER KING;

---

LET EVERY HEART PREPARE HIM ROOM
