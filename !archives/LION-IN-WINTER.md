  The Lion in Winter
]
by James Goldman
---

[plucking of a harp plays over violin]

---

[music ends and crown clatters on table]

---

## HENRY:
You must know that’s a futile gesture.

---

Come along.


---

## ALAIS:
No.

---

I’ll stay here and you can send reports.


---

## HENRY:
It’s going to be a jungle of a day: if I start growling now, I’ll never last.


---

## ALAIS:
You’ll last.

---

You’re like the rocks at Stonehenge; nothing knocks you down.


---

## HENRY:
In these rooms, Alais, on this Christmas, I have all the enemies I need.

---

## ALAIS:
You have more than you think.

---

## HENRY:
Are you one?

---

Has my willow turned to poison oak?


---

## ALAIS:
If I decided to be trouble, Henry, how much trouble could I be?


---

## HENRY:
*laughs* 
Not much.

---

You don’t matter to the others; only me.


---

## ALAIS:
How great a matter am I?



---

## HENRY:
Alais, in my time I’ve known contessas, milkmaids, courtesans and novices, whores, gypsies, jades and little boys, but nowhere in God’s Western world have I found anyone to love but you.


---

## ALAIS:
And Rosamund.

---

## HENRY:
She’s dead.

---

## ALAIS:
And Eleanor.

---

## HENRY:
The new Medusa?

---

My good wife?

---

## ALAIS:
How is your queen?

---

## HENRY:
Decaying, I suppose.

---

## ALAIS:
You haven’t seen her?


---

## HENRY:
No, nor smelled nor touched nor tasted.

---

Don’t be jealous of the gorgon; she is not among the things I love.

---

How many husbands do you know who dungeon up their wives?

---

I haven’t kept the great bitch in the keep for ten years out of passionate attachment.

---

Come.

---

I’ve heard she’s aging badly; let’s go and look.


---

## ALAIS:
Would it be troublesome if I betrayed you?


---

## HENRY:
We’ve no secrets, Eleanor and I.

---

How can you possibly betray me?

---

## ALAIS:
I could give away your plans.

---

## HENRY:
You don’t know what they are.

---

## ALAIS:
I know you want to disinherit Richard.


---

## HENRY:
So does Eleanor.

---

She knows young Henry’s dead.

---

The Young King died in summer, and I haven’t named and heir.

---

She knows I want John on the throne, and I know she wants Richard.

---

We are very frank about it.


---

## ALAIS:
Henry, I can’t be your mistress if I’m married to your son.


---

## HENRY:
Why can’t you?

---

Johnny wouldn’t mind.

---

## ALAIS:
I do not like your Johnny.

---

## HENRY:
He’s a good boy.

---

## ALAIS:
He’s got pimples and he smells of compost.


---

## HENRY:
He’s just sixteen; he can’t help the pimples.

---

## ALAIS:
He could bathe.

---

## HENRY:
It isn’t such a dreadful thing to be a Queen of England.

---

Not all eyes will weep for you.


---

## ALAIS:
Will yours?

---

## HENRY:
I don’t know.

---

Very likely.

---

## ALAIS:
All I want is not to lose you.

---

Can’t you hide me?

---

Can’t I simply disappear?


---

## HENRY:
You know you can’t.

---

Your little brother Philip’s King of France now and he wants your wedding or your dowry back.

---

I only took you for your dowry.

---

You were seven.

---

Two big knees and two big eyes and that’s all.

---

How was I to know?


---

## ALAIS:
Let Philip have the dowry back.

---

It isn’t much.


---

## HENRY:
I can’t.

---

The Vexin is a little county but it’s vital to me.

---

## ALAIS:
And I’m not.


---

## HENRY:
It’s been my luck to fall in love with landed women.

---

When I married Eleanor, I thought: “You lucky man.

---

The richest woman in the world.

---

She owns the Aquitaine, the greatest province on the Continent – and beautiful as well.

---

” She was, you know.


---

## ALAIS:
And you adored her.

---

## HENRY:
Memory fails.

---

There may have been an era when I did.
Let’s have one strand askew; nothing in life has any business being perfect.


---

## ALAIS:
Henry, I was brought up to be dutiful.

---

I smile a lot, bend easily and hope for very little.

---

It is useful training and it’s made a lot of hard things possible.
But, Henry, not this thing.


---

## HENRY:
I’ve had them summoned and I’ll have you by me.

---

With the headdress or without it.


---

## ALAIS:
Oh, what difference does it make who’s king?


---

## HENRY:
What difference?

---

## ALAIS:
Have you found religion, Henry?

---

Are you going to look down from the clouds and see who’s sitting in your place?


---

## HENRY:
I’ve got to know before I die.

---

I’ve built an empire and I’ve got to know it’s going to last.

---

I’ve put together England and I’ve added to it half of France.

---

I am the greatest power in a thousand years.

---

And after me comes John.

---

If I can’t leave this state to John, I’ve lived for nothing.


---

## ALAIS:
John doesn’t care for you at all.

---

## HENRY:
We love each other deeply.

---

## ALAIS:
None of them has any love for you.


---

## HENRY:
Because we fight?

---

Tell me they all three want the crown, I’ll tell you it’s a feeble prince who doesn’t.

---

They may snap at me or plot and that makes them the kind of sons I want.

---

I’ve snapped and plotted all my life: there is no other way to be king, alive and fifty all at once.


---

## ALAIS:
I’m going to fight for you.

---

## HENRY:
Oh, fine.

---

## ALAIS:
When I was sixteen and we started this depraved relationship, 

*laughs*

I left everything to you.

---

I lap sat, drank my milk, and did what I was told.

---

Not anymore.

---

Your cherub’s twenty-three now and she’s going to fight.


---

## HENRY:
With mace and chain?

---

## ALAIS:
With anything I can think of.


---

## HENRY:
That’s exactly what I need: another mind at work.

---

Try; you can hear the thinking through the walls.

---

There’s Geoffrey, humming treachery.

---

And Richard, growling out for gore.

---

And Eleanor, she’s thinking heavy thoughts like molten lead and marble slabs.

---

My house is full of intellectual activity.


---

## ALAIS:
Add mine.

---

## HENRY:
Alais, Alais – I don’t plan to give you up.

---

I don’t plan to give up anything.

---

I’ll make alliances and bargains, threaten, beg, break heads and hearts, and by the time this fine Christmas holiday is over, I’ll make an heir of John, a petty prince of Richard and I’ll still have you.


---

## ALAIS:
When can I believe you, Henry?

---

## HENRY:
Always, even when I lie.

---

## ALAIS:
How much is it safe to hope for?

---

## HENRY:
Everything.

---

## ALAIS:
But with so many enemies –


---

## HENRY:

I know – and some of them are more canny folk than I, or more cruel or more ruthless or dishonest.

---

But not all rolled in one.

---

The priests write all the history these days and they’ll do me justice.

---

Henry, they’ll say, was a master bastard.
Come; let’s go downstairs and meet the family.

[thumping, upbeat medieval tune]

---

[music ends]

---

## JOHN:
After you.

---

## GEOFFREY:
No; after you.

---

## RICHARD:
No; after you.


---

## JOHN:
Oh, have it your way; after me.

[stumbles down stairs]


---

## RICHARD:
You do keep growing, Johnny.

---

## JOHN:

In every way but upwards.

---

Look: holly.


I love Christmas.


---

## GEOFFREY:

Warm and rosy time.

---

The hot wine steams, the Yule log roars and we’re the fat that’s in the fire.

---

She’s here, you know.

---

## JOHN:
Who?


---

## RICHARD:
Mother.

---

## GEOFFREY:
Since this morning.

---

## RICHARD:
Have you seen her?

---

## GEOFFREY:
Haven’t you?

---

## RICHARD:
We’re not as friendly as we were.

---

## GEOFFREY:
Does she still favor you?

---

## RICHARD:
Does she or doesn’t she?

---

## JOHN:
If I’m supposed to make a fuss and kiss her hairy cheek, I won’t.


---

## RICHARD:
What you kiss, little prince, is up to you.


---

## JOHN:
I’m Father’s favorite; that’s what counts.


---

## RICHARD:
You hardly know me Johnny, so I beg you to believe my reputation: I’m a constant soldier and a sometime poet and I will be king.


---

## JOHN:
Just you remember: Father loves me best.

---

## ELEANOR:
The way you bicker it’s a wonder that he cares for any of you.


---

## Geoffrey:

Mother

---

## ELEANOR:

Geoffrey – but I do have handsome children.

---

John – you’re so clean and neat.

---

Henry takes good care of you.

---

And Richard.

---

Don’t look sullen, dear; it makes your eyes go small and piggy and your chin look weak.

---

Where’s Henry?


---

## RICHARD:
Upstairs with the family whore.

---

## ELEANOR:
That’s a mean and tawdry way to talk about your fiancée.

---

## JOHN:
My fiancée.

---

## ELEANOR:
Whosever fiancée.

---

I brought her up and she is dear to me and gentle.

---

Have we seen the French king yet?


---

## GEOFFREY:
Not yet.

---

## ELEANOR:
Let’s hope he’s grown up like his father – simon pure and simon simple.

---

Good, good Louis; if I’d managed sons for him instead of all those little girls, I’d still be stuck with being Queen of France and we should not have known each other.

---

Such, my angels, is the role of sex in history.

---

How’s your father?


---

## JOHN:
Do you care?


---

## ELEANOR:
More deeply, lamb, than you can possibly imagine.

---

Is my hair in place?

---

I’ve given up the looking glass; quicksilver has no sense of tact.

---

## RICHARD:
He still plans to make John king.


---

## ELEANOR:
Of course, he does.

---

My, what a greedy little trinity you are: king, king, king.

---

Two of you must learn to live with disappointment.


---

## HENRY:
Ah – but which two?

---

## ELEANOR:
Let’s deny them all and live forever.


---

## HENRY:
Dusk to dusk though all eternity.

---

How was your crossing?

---

Did the Channel part for you?


---

## ELEANOR:
It went flat when I told it to; I didn’t think to ask for more.

---

How dear of you to let me out of jail.


---

## HENRY:
It’s only for the holidays.

---

## ELEANOR:
Like school.

---

You keep me young.

---

Here’s gentle Alais.
No, no; greet me like you used to.
Fragile I am not: affection is a pressure I can bear.


---

## HENRY:
I’ve had the French King sent for.

---

We’ll state positions and I’ll make the first of many offers.

---

He’ll refuse it, naturally, I’ll make a better one and so on through the holidays until I win.

---

For the duration of this joyous ritual, you will give, to your father, your support.


---

## RICHARD:
Why will I?

---

## ELEANOR:
Out of duty, dear.


Tell me, what’s Philip like?

---

I hear he’s quite impressive for a boy of seventeen –


---

## HENRY:
My Lord.


---

## ELEANOR:
Oh – and you are.

---

I’m Eleanor, who might have been your mother.

---

All the others here you know.

---

## PHILIP:
Queen Eleanor – Your Grace.

---

## HENRY:
My Lord.

---

Welcome to Chinon.

---

## PHILIP:
Sir.


---

## HENRY:
Your grievances, as we have understood them, have to do with Princess Alais and her dowry.


---

## PHILIP:
Sixteen years ago, you made a treaty with us.

---

It is time its terms were executed.

---

## HENRY:
We are willing to discuss it.

---

## PHILIP:
Our position comes to this: that you will either hold the marriage or return the Vexin.

---

Alais marries Richard or we’ll have the county back at once.


---

## HENRY:
That’s clear, concise, and well presented.

---

My position is – Well, frankly, Philip, it’s a bit of a tangle.

---

Once I’m dead, who’s going to be king?

---

I could draw papers till my scribes drop but once I die, unless I’ve left behind me three contented sons, my lands will be split three ways in civil war.

---

You see my problem?

---

## PHILIP:
Clearly, but it’s yours, not mine.


---

## HENRY:
Two years ago, the Queen and I, for reasons passing understanding, made Richard the overlord of the Aquitaine.

---

That makes Richard very powerful.
How can I give him Alais too?

---

The man she marries has you for an ally.


---

## PHILIP:
It’s their wedding or the Vexin back.

---

Those are the terms you made with Louis.


---

## HENRY:
True, but academic, lad.

---

The Vexin’s mine.

---

## PHILIP:
By what authority?

---

## HENRY:
It’s got my troops all over it: that makes it mine.

[slams hand on table]

---

Now hear me, boy.

---

You take what memories you have of me and mark them out of date.

---

I’m not your father’s friend, now; I’m his son’s opponent.

---

## PHILIP:
I’m a king.

---

I’m no man’s boy.


---

## HENRY:
A king?

---

Because you put your ass on purple cushions?

[mimics a foreign, nobility accent]

---

## PHILIP:
Sir.


---

## HENRY:
Philip, you haven’t got the feel of this at all.

---

Use all your voices: when I bellow, bellow back.

---

## PHILIP:
I’ll note that down.

---

## HENRY:
This, too.

---

We are the world in small.

---

A nation is a human thing.

---

Surely, if we’re civilized, it must be possible to put the knives away.

---

We can make peace.

---

We have it in our hands.


---

## PHILIP:
I have tutors of my own.

---

Will that be all?


---

## HENRY:
Oh, think.

---

You came here for a reason.

---

You’ve made demands of me.

---

Now don’t you want to ask me if I’ve got an offer?

---

## PHILIP:
Have you got an offer?

---

## HENRY:
Not yet – but I’ll think of one.


Oh, by the way…


You’re better at this than I thought you’d be.

---

## PHILIP:

I wasn’t sure you noticed.


---

## HENRY:
Well – what shall we hang?

---

The holly or each other?


---

## ELEANOR:
You can’t read your sons at all.

---

That isn’t anger they’re projecting; it’s anxiety.

---

## HENRY:
I read them.

---

I know Richard’s moods and Johnny’s faces and the thought behind the pitch of Geoffrey’s voice.

---

The troubles at the other end; they don’t know me.

There is a legend of a king called Lear with whom I have a lot in common.

---

Both of us have kingdoms and three children we adore and both of us are old.

---

But there it stops.

---

He cut his kingdom into bits.

---

I can’t do that.

---

I’ve built this house and it will stand.


---

What I have architected, you will not destroy.

---

## RICHARD:
Would you say, Father, that I have the makings of a king?

---

## HENRY:
A splendid king.

---

## RICHARD:
Would you expect me, Father, to be disinherited without a fight?


---

## HENRY:
Of course you’ll fight.

---

I raised you to.


---

## RICHARD:
I don’t care what you offer Philip.

---

I don’t care what plans you make.

---

I’ll have the Aquitaine and Alais and the crown.

---

I’ll have them all.


---

## JOHN:
You’re going to love my coronation.


---

## RICHARD:
I won’t give up one to get the other.

---

I won’t trade of Alais or the Aquitaine to this –


This walking pustule.

---

No, your loving son will not.


---

## JOHN:
Did you hear what he called me?

---

## ELEANOR:
Clearly, dear.

---

Now run along; it’s nearly dinnertime.


---

## JOHN:

I only do what father tells me.

---

## HENRY:

Go and eat.

---

## JOHN:
Did I say something wrong?

---

I’m always saying something wrong.

---

All right, I’ll eat, I’ll eat.

---

## ELEANOR:
And that’s to be the king.

---

## GEOFFREY:
And I’m to be his chancellor.

---

Has he told you?

---

John will rule the country while I run it.

---

That’s to say, he gets to spend the taxes that I get to raise.


---

## ELEANOR:
How nice for you.

---

## GEOFFREY:
It’s not as nice as being king.

---

## HENRY:
We’ve made you Duke of Brittany.

---

Is that too little?


---

## GEOFFREY:
No one ever thinks of crowns and mentions Geoff.

---

Why is that?

---

I make out three prizes here – a throne, a princess, and the Aquitaine.

---

Three prizes and three sons; but no one ever says, “Here, Geoff, 

[claps]

here Geoff boy, here’s a bone for you.”


---

## HENRY:
I should have thought that being chancellor was a satisfying bone.


---

## GEOFFREY:
It isn’t power that I feel deprived of; it’s the mention that I miss.

---

There’s no affection for me here.

---

You wouldn’t think I’d want that, would you?

---

## ELEANOR:
Henry, I have a confession.

---

## HENRY:
Yes?

---

## ELEANOR:
I don’t much like our children.

Only you – the child I raised but didn’t bear.

---

## ALAIS:
You never cared for me.

---

## ELEANOR:
I did and do.

---

Believe me, Henry’s bed is Henry’s province: he can people it with sheep for all I care.

---

Which on occasion he has done.


---

## HENRY:
Still that?

---

When Rosamund’s been dead for seven years?


---

## ELEANOR:
Two months and eighteen days.

---

I never liked her much.

---

## HENRY:
You count the days?

---

## ELEANOR:
I made the numbers up.

He found Miss Clifford in the mists of Wales and brought her home for closer observation.

---

Liking what he saw, he scrutinized her many years.

---

He loved her deeply and she him.

---

And yet, my dear, when Henry had choose between his lady and my lands –


---

## ALAIS:
He’ll leave me if he has to; I know that.

---

## ELEANOR:
Poor Alais.

---

## ALAIS:
There’s no sport in hurting me; it is so easy.


---

## ELEANOR:
After all the years of love, the hair I’ve brushed and braided and the tears I’ve kissed away, do you think I could bring myself to hurt you?


---

## ALAIS:
Eleanor, with both hands tied behind you.

[slow, solemn plucking of a harp played over flute music]

---

## HENRY:
She is lovely, isn’t she?

---

## ELEANOR:
Yes, very.

[music ends]

---

## HENRY:
If I’d chosen, who could I have picked to love to gall you more?

---

## ELEANOR:
There’s no one.

Come on; let’s finish Christmasing the place.

[light, gentle harp music]


---

## HENRY:
Time hasn’t done a thing but wrinkle you.


---

## ELEANOR:
It hasn’t even done that.

---

I have born six girls, five boys and thirty-one connubial years of you.

---

How am I possible?


---

## HENRY:
There are moments when I miss you.

---

## ELEANOR:
Many?

---

## HENRY:
Do you doubt it?

---

## ELEANOR:
That’s my wooly sheep dog.

---

So wee Johnny gets the crown?


---

## HENRY:
I’ve heard it rumored, but I don’t believe it.


---

## ELEANOR:
Losing Alais will be hard, for you do love her.


---

## HENRY:
It’s an old man’s last attachment; nothing more.

---

How hard do you find living in your tower?


---

## ELEANOR:
It was difficult in the beginning but that’s past.

---

I find I’ve seen the world enough.

---

I have my maids and menials in my courtyard, and I hold my little court.

---

It suits me now.


---

## HENRY:
I’ll never let you out.

---

You led too many civil wars against me.


---

## ELEANOR:
And I damn near won the last one.

---

Still, as long as I get trotted out for Christmas Courts and state occasions now and then – for I do like to see you – it’s enough.

---

Do you still need the Vexin, Henry?


---

## HENRY:
Need you ask?

---

## ELEANOR:
My strategy is ten years old.

---

## HENRY:
It is as crucial as it ever was.

---

My troops there are a day away from Paris, just a march of twenty miles.

---

I must keep it.


---

## ELEANOR:
I’d say all the jollying this room can stand.

---

I’m famished.

---

Let’s go in to dinner.

[harp music ends]


---

## HENRY:
Arm in arm.

---

## ELEANOR:
And hand in hand.

---

You’re still a marvel of a man.

---

## HENRY:
And you’re my lady.

---

## ELEANOR:
Henry, dear, if Alais doesn’t marry Richard, I will see you lose the Vexin.

---

## HENRY:
Well, I thought you’d never say it.

---

## ELEANOR:
I can do it.


---

## HENRY:
You can try.

---

## ELEANOR:
My Richard is the next king, not your John.

---

I know you, Henry.

---

I know every twist and bend you’ve got, and I’ll be waiting round each corner for you.


---

## HENRY:
Do you truly care who’s king?

---

## ELEANOR:
I care because you care so much.


---

## HENRY:
I might surprise you.

---

Eleanor, I’ve fought and bargained all these years as if the only thing I lived for was what happened after I was dead.

---

I’ve something else to live for now.

---

I’ve blundered onto peace.


---

## ELEANOR:
On Christmas Eve.


---

## HENRY:
Since Louis died, while Philip grew, I’ve had no France to fight.

---

And in that lull, I’ve found how good it is to write a law or make a tax more fair or sit in judgement to decide which peasant gets a cow.

---

There is, I tell you, nothing more important in the world.

---

And now the French boy’s big enough and I am sick of war.


---

## ELEANOR:
Come to your question, Henry; make the plea.

---

What would you have me do?

---

Give out, give up, give in?


---

## HENRY:
Give me a little peace.

---

## ELEANOR:
A little?

---

Why so modest?

---

How about eternal peace?

---

Now there’s a thought.

[decanter thuds on table]


---

## HENRY:
If you oppose me, I will strike you any way I can.

---

## ELEANOR:
Of course, you will.

Henry?


---

## HENRY:
Madam?

---

## ELEANOR:
Did you ever love me?

---

## HENRY:
No.


---

## ELEANOR:
Good.

---

That will make this pleasanter.

[heavy, solemn harp music is played over violin]

---

[music ends]


---

## RICHARD:
All right.

---

I’ve come.

---

I’m here.

---

What was it you wanted?


---

## ELEANOR:
Just to talk.

---

We haven’t been alone, the two of us, in – How long is it, lamb?

---

Two years?

---

You look fit.

---

War agrees with you.

---

I keep informed.

---

I follow all your slaughters from a distance.

---

Do sit down.


---

## RICHARD:
Is this an audience, a goodnight kiss or an ambush?


---

## ELEANOR:
Let us hope it’s a reunion.

---

Must you look so stern?

---

I sent for you to say I want your love again, but I can’t say it to a face like that.


---

## RICHARD:
My love, of all things.

---

What could you want it for?


---

## ELEANOR:
Why, for itself.

---

What other purpose could I have?


---

## RICHARD:
You’ll tell me when you’re ready to.


---

## ELEANOR:
I scheme a lot; I know.

---

That’s how a queen in prison spends her time.

---

But there is more to me than that.

---

Can’t I say I love a son and be believed?


---

## RICHARD:
If I were you, I’d try another tack.

---

I have not damned-up floods of passion for you.

---

There’s no chance I’ll overflow.


---

## ELEANOR:
You are a dull boy.

---

## RICHARD:
Am I?

---

## ELEANOR:
Dull as plainsong: la, la, la, forever on one note.

---

I gave the Church up out of boredom.

---

I can do as much for you.


---

## RICHARD:
You’ll never give me up; not while I hold the Aquitaine.


---

## ELEANOR:
You think I’m motivated by a love of property?


---

## RICHARD:
I think you want it back.

---

You’re so deceitful you can’t ask for water when you’re thirsty.


---

## ELEANOR:
If I’m so devious, why don’t you go?

---

Don’t stand there quivering in limbo.

---

Love me, little lamb, or leave me.


---

## RICHARD:
Leave you, madam?

---

With pure joy.


---

## ELEANOR:
Departure is a simple act.

---

You put the left foot down and then the right.


---

## JOHN:
Mother –


---

## ELEANOR:
Hush, dear.

---

Mother’s fighting.

---

## JOHN:
Father’s coming with the treaty terms.


---

## ELEANOR:
No doubt he’s told you what they are.


---

## JOHN:
He doesn’t have to.

---

Don’t’ you think I know what’s what?


---

## ELEANOR:
Of course, you do, dear.

---

Has he put the terms to Philip?

---

## HENRY:
Not yet, but we’re shortly granting him an audience.

---

I hope you’ll attend.


---

## ELEANOR:
Are we to know the terms or have you come to tease us?

---

## HENRY:
Not at all. The terms are these.


---

## RICHARD:
What are you giving up to Philip?

---

What of mine?


---

## JOHN:
Whatever you’ve got goes to me.

---

## GEOFFREY:
And what’s the nothing Geoffrey gets?


---

## HENRY:
For God’s sake, boys, you can’t all three be king.

---

## RICHARD:
All three of us can try.

---

## HENRY:
That’s pointless now.

---

The treaty calls for you to marry Alais and you shall.

---

I want you to succeed me, Richard.

---

Alais and the crown: I give you both.


---

## RICHARD:
I’ve got no sense of humor.

---

If I did, I’d laugh.

---

## HENRY:
I’ve used you badly, haven’t I?

---

## RICHARD:
You’ve used me cleverly and well.


---

## HENRY:
Not anymore.

---

I mean to do it.

---

## JOHN:
What about me?

---

I’m your favorite, I’m the one you love.


---

## HENRY:
John.

---

I can’t help myself.

---

Stand next to Richard.

---

See how you compare.

---

Could you keep anything I gave you?

---

Could you beat him on the field?


---

## JOHN:
You could.

---

## HENRY:
But, John, I won’t be there.

---

## JOHN:
Let’s fight him now.

---

## HENRY:
How can I?

---

There’s no way to win.

---

I’m losing too, John.

---

All my dreams for you are lost.


---

## JOHN:
You’ve led me on.


---

## HENRY:
I never meant to.

---

## JOHN:
You’re a failure as a father, you know that.

---

## HENRY:
I’m sorry, John.

---

## JOHN:
Not yet you’re not.

---

But I’ll do something terrible and you’ll be sorry then.


---

## ELEANOR:
Did you rehearse all this or are you improvising?


---

## HENRY:
Good God, woman, face the facts.


---

## ELEANOR:
Which ones?

---

We’ve got so many.


---

## HENRY:
Power is the only fact.

He is our ablest son.

---

He is the strongest, isn’t he?

---

How can I keep him from the crown?

---

He’d only take it if I didn’t give it to him.


---

## ELEANOR:
No – you’d make me fight to get it.

---

I know you: you’d never give me everything.


---

## HENRY:
True – and I haven’t.

---

You get Alais and you get the kingdom, but I get the one thing I want most.

---

If you’re king, England stays intact.

---

I get that.

---

It’s all yours now – the girl, the crown, the whole black bloody business.

---

Isn’t that enough?


---

## ALAIS:
I don’t know whose to be congratulated.

---

Not me, certainly.
You got me for your Richard.

---

How’d you manage it?

---

Did you tell him he’s your wooly lamb?

---

Or say how much you like it in your prison?


---

## ELEANOR:
It’s all lies but I told him.


---

## ALAIS:
Kings, queens, knights everywhere you look and I’m the only pawn.

---

I haven’t got a thing to lose: that makes me – 

[dagger slams into desk]

dangerous.

[case thuds]

---

## ELEANOR:
Poor child.

---

## JOHN:
Poor John – who says poor John?

---

Don’t everybody sob at once.

---

My God, if I went up on flames, there’s not a living soul who’d pee on me to put the fire out.


---

## RICHARD:
Let’s strike a flint and see.

---

## JOHN:
He hates me.

---

Why?

---

What should he hate me for?

---

Am I the eldest son?

---

Am I the heir?

---

Am I the hero?

---

What’s my crime?

---

Is it some childhood score, some baby hurt?

---

When I was six and you were sixteen, did I brutalize you?

---

What?


---

## ELEANOR:
For whatever I have done to you, forgive me.


---

## JOHN:
What could you have done?

---

You were never close enough.


---

## ELEANOR:
When you were little, you were torn from me: blame Henry.


---

## JOHN:
I was torn from you by midwives and I haven’t seen you since.

---

## ELEANOR:
Then blame me if it helps.

---

## RICHARD:
No, it’s the midwives’ fault.

---

They threw the baby out and kept the afterbirth.


---

## JOHN:
You’re everything a little brother dreams of.

---

You know that?

---

I used to dream about you all the time.


---

## ELEANOR:
Oh, Johnny…

---

## JOHN:
That’s right, Mother; mother me.


---

## ELEANOR:
Yes, if you’d let me.

---

## JOHN:
Let you?

---

Let you put your arms around me just the way you never did?
You can do it.

---

Think I’m Richard.


---

That’s it.

---

That’s the way.

---

Now kiss my scabby cheek and run your fingers through my hair.


---

## ELEANOR:
John, John…

---

## JOHN:
No – it’s all false.

---

You know what I am?

---

I’m the family nothing.

---

Geoffrey’s shrewd and Richard’s brave and I’m not anything.


---

## ELEANOR:
You are to me.


---

## JOHN:
I’ll show you, Eleanor.

---

I haven’t lost yet.
Goeff.

---

## GEOFFREY:
Run along.

---

I’m busy now.

---

## JOHN:
I give the orders.

---

I’m the master.

---

When I call, you come.


---

## GEOFFREY:
There’s news in Chinon, John.

---

That falling sound was you.

---

## JOHN:
The woods are full of chancellors.

---

## GEOFFREY:
And the castle’s full of kings.

---

## JOHN:
Oh, you’re not really leaving me?


---

## GEOFFREY:
No; I’ve already left.


---

## JOHN:
I don’t care.

---

I don’t need anybody.

---

## GEOFFREY:
Well, Mummy, here I am.

---

## ELEANOR:
John’s lost a chancellor, has he?

---

## GEOFFREY:
And you’ve gained one.

---

## ELEANOR:
It’s a bitter thing your Mummy has to say.

---

## GEOFFREY:
She doesn’t trust me.


---

## ELEANOR:
You know Henry isn’t through with John.

---

He’ll keep the Vexin until the moon goes blue from cold and as for Richard’s wedding day, we’ll the see the second coming first; the needlework can last for years.


---

## GEOFFREY:
I know.

---

You know I know.

---

I know you know I know; we know that Henry knows, and Henry knows we know it.

---

We’re a knowledgeable family.

---

Do you want my services or don’t you?


---

## ELEANOR:
Why are you dropping John?

---

## GEOFFREY:
Because you’re going to win.

---

## ELEANOR:
I haven’t yet.

---

## GEOFFREY:
You will with me to help you.

---

I can handle John.

---

I’ll take him by the hand and walk him into any trap you set.


---

## ELEANOR:
You’re good, you’re first class, Geoff.

---

Did John agree?


---

## GEOFFREY:
To what?

---

## ELEANOR:
To making you his chancellor when you betray me?

---

## GEOFFREY:
I Have some principles.

---

## ELEANOR:
Then how much did you get from Henry?

---

## GEOFFREY:
Get from Henry?

---

## ELEANOR:
What’s the fee for selling me to him?

---

Or have you found some way of selling everyone to everybody?


---

## GEOFFREY:
Not yet, Mummy, but I’m working on it.

---

I don’t care who’s king, but you and Henry do.

---

I want to watch the two of you go picnicking on one another.


---

## ELEANOR:
Yes, it’s true; you really mean it.

---

## GEOFFREY:
Do you really blame me?

---

## ELEANOR:
You’ve a gift for hating.

---

## GEOFFREY:
You’re the expert; you should know.


---

## ELEANOR:
You’ve loved me all these years.


---

## GEOFFREY:
Well, God forgive me, I’ve upset the Queen Madam, you may rot.

---

## ELEANOR:

We need you.

---

Help us.

---

## GEOFFREY:
What?

---

And miss the fun of selling you?


---

## ELEANOR:
Be Richard’s chancellor.


---

## GEOFFREY:
Rot.

---

## ELEANOR:
Oh, Geoffrey.

---

Well, that’s how deals are made.

---

We’ve got him if we want him.

---

I should like some wine.

---

Why did I have to have such clever children?

---

He will sell us all, you know; but only if he thinks we think he won’t.

---

Scenes.

---

I can’t touch my sons except in scenes.
What’s the matter, Richard?

---

## RICHARD:
Nothing.

---

## ELEANOR:
It’s a very heavy thing, your nothing.

---

When I write or send for you to speak or reach, your nothings come.

---

Like stones.


---

## RICHARD:
Don’t play a scene with me.


---

## ELEANOR:
I wouldn’t if I could.

---

## RICHARD:
There’d be no profit in it.

---

That’s my one advantage over you.

---

You’re wiser, shrewder, more experienced.

---

I’m colder; I feel less.


---

## ELEANOR:
Why, you don’t know yourself at all.

---

I’ve known who I am for some years now.

---

I had, at one time, many appetites.

---

I wanted poetry and power and young men who create them both.

---

I even wanted Henry, too, in those days.

---

Now I’ve only one desire left: to see you king.


---

## RICHARD:
The only thing you want to see is Father’s vitals on a bed of lettuce.

---

You don’t care who wins as long as Henry loses.

---

You’d see Philip on the English throne.

---

You’d feed us to the Frans or hand us to the Holy Romans.

---

You’d do anything.


---

## ELEANOR:
That’s good to know.

---

## RICHARD:
You are Medea to the teeth but this one son you won’t use for vengeance on your husband.


---

## ELEANOR:
I could bend you.

---

I could wear you like a bracelet – but I’d sooner die.


---

## RICHARD:
You’re old enough to die, in any case.


---

## ELEANOR:
How my captivity has changed you.

---

Henry meant to hurt me, and he’s hacked you up instead.

---

More wine.
Men coveted this talon once.

---

Henry was eighteen when we met, and I was Queen of France.

[soft music with reminiscent tone plays]

---

He came down from the North to Paris with a mind like Aristotle’s and a form like a mortal sin.

---

We shattered the Commandments, on the spot.

---

I spent three months annulling Louis and in spring, in May not far from here, we married.

---

Young Count Henry and his Countess.

---

But in three years’ time, I was his Queen, and he was King of England.

---

Done at twenty-one.

---

Five years your junior, General.


---

## RICHARD:
I can count.

---

## ELEANOR:
No doubt the picture of your parents being fond does not hang in your gallery – but we were fond.

---

There was no Thomas Becket then, or Rosamund.

---

No rivals – only me.

---

And then young Henry came and you and all the blossoms in my garden.

---

Yes, if I’d been sterile, darling, I’d be happier today.


---

## RICHARD:
Is that designed to hurt me?

---

## ELEANOR:
What a waste.

---

I’ve fought with Henry over who comes next, whose dawn is it and which son gets the sunset, and we’ll never live to see it.

---

Look at you.

---

I loved you more than Henry and it’s cost me everything.


---

## RICHARD:
What do you want?

---

## ELEANOR:
I want us back the way we were.

---

## RICHARD:
That’s not it.

---

## ELEANOR:
All right, then.

---

I want the Aquitaine.


---

## RICHARD:
Now that’s the mother I remember.


---

## ELEANOR:
No, it’s not at all, but if you find her more congenial, she’s the one you’ll get.

---

We can win.

---

I can get you Alais.

---

I can make the marriage happen – but I’ve got to have the Aquitaine to do it.

---

I must have it back.


---

## RICHARD:
You were better in your scene with Geoffrey.


---

## ELEANOR:
Shall I write my will?

---

"To Richard, everything."

---

Would you believe me then?

---

Where’s paper?


---

## RICHARD:
Paper burns.

---

## ELEANOR:
And tears and turns to pudding in the rain.

---

What can I do?


---

## RICHARD:
I did think Geoffrey put it nicely.

---

You can rot.

---

## ELEANOR:
I love you.


---

## RICHARD:
You love nothing.

---

You are incomplete.

---

The human parts of you are missing.

---

You’re as dead as you are deadly.


---

## ELEANOR:
Don’t leave me.

---

## RICHARD:
You were lovely once.

---

I’ve seen the pictures.


---

## ELEANOR:
Oh, don’t you remember how you loved me?

---

## RICHARD:
Vaguely – like a legend.

---

## ELEANOR:
You remember.

---

We were always hand in hand.
That’s how it felt.

---

## RICHARD:
As coarse and hot as that.


---

## ELEANOR:
This won’t burn.

---

I’ll scratch a will on this.
To Richard, everything.


---

## RICHARD:
Mother!

[knife clangs on floor]


---

## ELEANOR:
Remember how I taught you numbers and the lute and poetry?

---

## RICHARD:
Mother.

---

## ELEANOR:
See?

---

You do remember.

---

I taught you dancing too, and languages and all the music that I knew and how to love what’s beautiful.

---

The sun was warmer then and we were every day together.

[thumping drums and violin play]

---

## GEOFFREY:
John – there you are.

[music ends]

---

## JOHN:
Go find yourself another fool.

---

## GEOFFREY:
You’re angry: good.

---

Now, here’s my plan.


---

## JOHN:
You are a rancid bastard.

---

Want to fight?


---

## GEOFFREY:
John, use your head.

---

Would I betray you?

---

## JOHN:
Why not?

---

Everybody else does.


---

## GEOFFREY:
John, I only turned on you to get their confidence.

---

It worked; they trust me.


---

## JOHN:
I tell you; your leg could fall off at the pelvis and I wouldn’t trust the stump to bleed.


---

## GEOFFREY:
If you’re not king, I’m nothing.

---

You’re my way to power, John.

---

## JOHN:
I still don’t trust you.

---

## GEOFFREY:
Always put your faith in vices.

---

Trust my slyness if you think I’m sly.

---

Make use of me, deceive me, cast me off – but not until I’ve made you king.


---

## JOHN:
You think I can’t out-think you, do you?

---

All right, what’s your plan?


---

## GEOFFREY:
We’ve got to make a deal with Philip.

---

## JOHN:
Why?


---

## GEOFFREY:
Because you’re out and Richard’s in.

---

## JOHN:
What kind of deal?

---

## GEOFFREY:
A war.

---

If we three join and fight now, we can finish Richard off.

---

## JOHN:
And Mother, too?

---

## GEOFFREY:
And Mother, too.

---

Well, do we do it?

---

Is it on?

---

## JOHN:
I’ve got to think.

---

## GEOFFREY:
We’re extra princes now.

---

You know where extra princes go.

---

## JOHN:
Down?


---

## GEOFFREY:
Very down.

---

## PHILIP:
I see I’m early for my audience.

---

Or am I late?


---

## GEOFFREY:
No, you’re exquisitely on time.

---

I feel the strangest sense of kinship with you, Philip.


---

## PHILIP:
So, you’ve sensed it, too.

---

## GEOFFREY:
How far around the corner were you?

---

## PHILIP:
How did you know?

---

## GEOFFREY:
You came in so conveniently.

---

## PHILIP:
I’ll learn.


---

## GEOFFREY:
Well, was there anything you didn’t overhear?


---

## PHILIP:
John’s answer.

---

Does he want a war or doesn’t he?


---

## GEOFFREY:
Do you?

---

If John asks for your soldiers, will he get them?

---

## PHILIP:
If John wants a war, he’s got one.

---

## GEOFFREY:
John, you hear that?

---

## JOHN:
I’m still thinking.

---

## GEOFFREY:
Let me help.

---

It’s either Richard on the throne or you.

---

## JOHN:
You think we’d win?


---

## PHILIP:
I know it.

[Henry heard bickering with Alais in the distance]

---

## JOHN:
Father’s coming.

---

## GEOFFREY:

This way.

---

We’ve got plans to make.

John.

---

## JOHN:
In a minute.

---

## HENRY:
I’d appreciate a little quiet confidence.

---

I have enough nits picking at me.

---

## JOHN:
Father, have you got a minute?


---

## HENRY:
What for?

---

## JOHN:
If you had a minute, we could talk.

---

## HENRY:
I’m busy now.

---

Have you seen Philip?


---

## JOHN:
Look: you know that hunting trip we’re taking for my birthday?

---

## HENRY:
Well?

---

## JOHN:
Forget it.

---

I’m not going.

---

## HENRY:
Why not?

---

## JOHN:
I’m just not.


---

## HENRY:
But, John, the trip’s all planned.

---

## JOHN:
I’ll go get Philip for you.

---

## HENRY:
You did have a good time last year, didn’t you?

---

## JOHN:
I loved it.

---

## HENRY:
What’s wrong, lad?

---

## JOHN:
You’re busy.

---

## HENRY:
True enough but –

---

## JOHN:
You’ve got more important things to do.


---

## HENRY:
I can’t make things all right if I don’t know what’ s wrong.

---

## JOHN:
You’re giving Richard everything.

---

## HENRY:
You think I’d do that?

---

## JOHN:
You don’t love me anymore.

---

## HENRY:
Don’t pout – and stand up straight.

---

How often do I have to tell you?

---

## JOHN:
When’s my coronation?

---

## HENRY:
When I say so.

---

## JOHN:
That’s no answer.

---

## HENRY:
John.

---

## JOHN:
Tell her how much you love her.

---

You’re a wonder with women.

---

## HENRY:
What in hell was that about?

---

## ALAIS:
He heard you disinherit him upstairs and wondered if you meant it.


---

## HENRY:
If I meant it?

---

When I’ve fathered him and mothered him and babied him?

---

He’s all I’ve got.

---

How often does he have to hear it?

---

Every supper?

---

Should we start the soup with who we love and who we don't?

---

## ALAIS:
I heard you promise me to Richard.

---

## HENRY:
You don’t think I meant it?


---

## ALAIS:
I think you enjoy it, passing me from hand to hand.

---

What am I to you – a collection plate?


---

## HENRY:
I’ve got to get the Aquitaine for John.


---

## ALAIS:
I talk people and you answer back in provinces.


---

## HENRY:
They get it mixed up.

---

What’s the Aquitaine to Eleanor?

---

It’s not a province, it’s a way to torture me.

---

That’ s why she’s upstairs wooing Richard, wheezing on the coals.

---

She’ll squeeze it out of him.

---

God, but I’d love to eavesdrop.
I taught you prancing, lamb, and lute and flute –


---

## ELEANOR:
That’s marvelous; it’s absolutely me.

---

There you are.

---

I thought as long as I was coming down, I’d bring them.


---

## HENRY:
Whatever are you giving me?

---

## ELEANOR:
You’re such a child: you always ask.

---

## HENRY:
To Henry.
Heavy.

It’s my headstone.

---

Eleanor, you spoil me.


---

## ELEANOR:

*laughs heartily*
I never could deny you anything.


---

## ALAIS:
You’ve grown old gracefully, you two.

---

I’ll give you that.

---

## HENRY:
Don’t go.

---

It nettles her to see how much I need you.


---

## ALAIS:
You need me, Henry, like a tailor needs a tinker’s dam.

---

## HENRY:
Alais –

---

## ALAIS:
I know that look.

---

He’s going to say he loves me.

---

## HENRY:
Like my life.

I talk like that to keep her spirits up.

---

Well, how’d you do with Richard?

---

Did you break his heart?


---

## ELEANOR:
You think he ought to give me back the Aquitaine?


---

## HENRY:
I can’t think why he shouldn’t.

---

After all, I’ve promised him the throne.


---

## ELEANOR:
The boy keeps wondering if your promises are any good.


---

## HENRY:
There’s no sense asking if the air’s good when there’s nothing else to breathe.


---

## ELEANOR:
Exactly what I told him.

---

## HENRY:
Have you got it?

---

Will he give it back?


---

## ELEANOR:
How can you think I’d ever pass it on to John?

---

## HENRY:
It matters to me desperately.

---

## ELEANOR:
Why should it?

---

Does it matter what comes after us?


---

## HENRY:
Ask any sculptor, “why don’t you work in butter?”


---

## ELEANOR:
Is Johnny bronze?

---

He’ll go as green from mold as any of our sons.


---

## HENRY:
I know that.

---

Richard gets the throne.

---

You heard my promise.

---

What else do you want?


---

## ELEANOR:
No Aquitaine for John.

---

## HENRY:
I’ve got to give him something.

---

Isn’t some agreement possible?


---

## ELEANOR:
Love, in a world where carpenters get resurrected, anything is possible.


---

## HENRY:
You bore him, dammit; he’s your son.


---

## ELEANOR:
Oh, heavens yes.

---

Two hundred eighty days I bore him.

---

I recall them all.

---

You’d only just found Rosamund.


---

## HENRY:
Why her so damn particularly.

---

I’ve found other women.

---

## ELEANOR:
Countless others.


---

## HENRY:
What’s your count?

---

Let’s have a tally of the bedspreads you’ve spread out on.


---

## ELEANOR:
Thomas Becket’s

---

## HENRY:
That’s a lie.

---

## ELEANOR:
I know it.

---

Jealousy looks silly on us, Henry.

---

## HENRY:
Doesn’t it.

---

## ELEANOR:
You still care what I do.

---

## HENRY:
I want the Aquitaine for John.

---

I want it and I’ll have it.


---

## ELEANOR:
Is that menace you’re conveying?

---

Is it to be torture?

---

Will you boil me or stretch me, which?

---

Or am I to be perforated?


---

## HENRY:
I have the documents and you will sign.


---

## ELEANOR:
How can you force me to?

---

Threats?

---

Sign or I refuse to feed you?

---

Tears?

---

Bribes, offers, deals?

---

I’m like the earth, old man; there isn’t any way around me.


---

## HENRY:
I adore you.

---

## ELEANOR:
Save your aching arches; that road is closed.

---

## HENRY:
I’ve got an offer for you, ma Jolie.

---

## ELEANOR:
A deal, a deal.

---

I give the richest province on the Continent to John for what?

---

You tell me, mastermind.

---

For what?


---

## HENRY:
Your freedom.


---

## ELEANOR:
Oh.

---

## HENRY:
Once Johnny has the Aquitaine, you’re free.

---

I’ll let you out.

---

Think: on the loose in London, winters in Provence, impromptu trips to visit Richard anywhere he’s killing people.

---

All that for a signature.


---

## ELEANOR:
You’re good.

---

## HENRY:
I thought it might appeal to you.

---

You always fancied travelling.


---

## ELEANOR:
Yes, I did.

---

I even made poor Louis take me on Crusade.

---

How’s that for blasphemy?

---

I dressed by maids as Amazons and rode bare breasted halfway to Damascus.

---

Louis had a seizure and I damn near died of windburn, but the troops were dazzled.

---

Henry, I’m against the wall.


---

## HENRY:
Because I’ve put you there, don’t think I like to see it.


---

## ELEANOR:
I believe it; you do feel for me.

---

To be a prisoner, to be bricked in when you’ve known the world – I’ll never know how I’ve survived.

---

These ten years, Henry, have been unimaginable.

---

And you can offer me the only thing I want, if I give up the only thing I treasure and still feel for me.

---

You give your falcons more affection than I get.


---

## HENRY:
My falcons treat me better.

---

## ELEANOR:
Handle me with iron gloves, then.


---

## HENRY:
Sign the papers and we’ll break the happy news.

---

The Queen is free, John joins the landed gentry, Philip’s satisfied, and Richard gets a princess.


---

## ELEANOR:
Yes.

---

Let’s have it done.

---

I’ll sign.

---

On one condition.

---

## HENRY:
Name it.

---

## ELEANOR:
Have the wedding now.


---

## HENRY:
What’s that?

---

## ELEANOR:
Why, I’ve surprised you.

---

Surely, it’s not sudden.

---

They’ve been marching down the aisle for sixteen years and that’s a long walk.

---

John can be the best man – that’s a laugh – and you can give the bride away.

---

I want to watch you do it.


---

## HENRY:
Alais – I can live without her.

---

## ELEANOR:
And I thought you loved her.

---

## HENRY:
So I do.

---

## ELEANOR:
Thank God.

---

You frightened me: I was afraid this wouldn’t hurt.


---

## HENRY:
You fill me full of fear and pity.

---

What a tragedy you are.


---

## ELEANOR:
I wonder, do you ever wonder if I slept with Geoffrey?

---

## HENRY:
With my father?

---

## ELEANOR:
It’s not true but one hears rumors.

---

Don’t you ever wonder?


---

## HENRY:
Is it rich, despising me?

---

Is it rewarding?

---

## ELEANOR:
No – it’s terrible.

---

## HENRY:
Then stop it.

---

## ELEANOR:
How?

---

It’s what I live for.

---

## HENRY:
Rosamund, I loved you!


---

## ELEANOR:
(Calling)
John – Richard – Geoffrey.

---

## HENRY:
Where’s a priest?

---

I’ll do it.

---

I’ll show you.

---

By Christ, I will.
Somebody dig me up a priest.

---

## JOHN:
What for?

---

What’s happening?

---

## ELEANOR:
Richard’s getting married.

---

## JOHN:
Now?

---

He’s getting married now?

---

## ELEANOR:
I never cease to marvel at the quickness of your mind.


---

## JOHN:
You can’t hurt me, you bag of bile, no matter what you say.
But you can.

---

Father, why?

---

## HENRY:
Because I say so.


---

You.

---

Bring me a bishop.

---

## ELEANOR:
Get old Durham.

---

He’ll be in the chapel. 
You’ll make a lovely bride.

---

I wonder if I’ll cry.


---

## ALAIS:
You sound as if you think it’s going to happen.

---

## ELEANOR:
And I do.


---

## ALAIS:
He’s only plotting.

---

Can’t you tell when Henry’s plotting.

---

## ELEANOR:
Not this time.

---

## ALAIS:
He’ll never give me up.

---

## HENRY:
You think I won’t?

---

## ALAIS:
Because you told me so.

---

## HENRY:
You’re not my Helen; I won’t fight a war to save a face.

---

We are done.

---

## ALAIS:
I don’t believe you.

---

## HENRY:
Wait ten minutes.


---

## GEOFFREY:

Durham is waiting in the chapel.

---

## HENRY:
Good – let’s get it over with.

---

## ALAIS:
Don’t do this to me, Henry.

[slow, solemn tune of a cello plays]

---

## HENRY:
Take her.

---

## ALAIS:

No, wait. You don't want me, Richard. 

---

## HENRY:

Go to him.


---

## ALAIS:
Not yet –

I am your sister.

---

Can’t you find some pity for me?

Maman, you won’t let this happen.

Henry, if you ever loved me –


I won’t do it.

---

I won’t say the words, not one of them.

---

Henry, please.

---

It makes no sense.

---

Why give me up?

---

What are you gaining?

---

## HENRY:
The Aquitaine, of course.

[cello music ends]

---

## RICHARD:
What’s that?

---

## HENRY:
The Aquitaine.

---

Your mother gets her freedom and I get the Aquitaine.

That is the proposition, isn’t it?

---

You did agree.

---

## RICHARD:
Of course she did.

---

I knew, I knew it.

---

It was all pretense.

---

You used me.

---

God, and I believed you.

---

I believed it all.


---

## ELEANOR:
I meant it all.

---

## RICHARD:
No wedding.

---

There will be no wedding.

---

## HENRY:
But my boy –


---

## RICHARD:
Not at this price.


---

## HENRY:
But Durham’s waiting.


---

## RICHARD:
She’s not worth the Aquitaine.

---

## HENRY:
You’ve simply got to marry her.

---

It isn’t much to ask.

---

For my sake, Richard.


---

## RICHARD:
Never.

---

## HENRY:
But I’ve promised Philip.

---

Think of my position.


---

## RICHARD:
Damn the wedding and to hell with your position.

---

## HENRY:
You don’t dare defy me.

---

## RICHARD:
Don’t I?

---

## HENRY:
You’re the King of France, for God’s sake.

---

Speak up.

---

Do something.


---

## RICHARD:
Make a threat, why don’t you?

---

Scare me.

---

## PHILIP:
You dunce.

---

## RICHARD:
Am I?

---

## PHILIP:
He never meant to have the wedding.

---

## HENRY:
Say again?

---

## PHILIP:
You’re good at rage.

---

I like the way you play it.


---

## HENRY:
Boy, don’t ever call a king a liar to his face.


---

## PHILIP:
I’m not a boy.

---

To you or anybody.

---

## HENRY:
Boy, you came here asking for a wedding or the Vexin back.

---

By God, you don’t get either one.

---

It’s no to both.

---

## PHILIP:
You have a pact with France.

---

## HENRY:
Then damn the document and damn the French.

[papers tearing]

---

She’ll never marry, not while I’m alive.


---

## PHILIP:
Your life and never are two different times.


---

## HENRY:
Not on my clock, boy.

---

## RICHARD:
Listen to the lion.


---

## HENRY:
Don’t spoil it, Richard.

---

## RICHARD:
How’s your bad leg?

---

## HENRY:
Better, thank you.

---

## RICHARD:
And your back and all the rest of it?

---

You’re getting old.

---

One day you’ll have me once too often.


---

## HENRY:
When?

---

I’m fifty now.

---

My God, boy, I’m the oldest man I know.

---

I’ve got a decade on the Pope.

---

What’s it to be?

---

The broadsword when I’m eighty- five?


---

## RICHARD:
I’m not a second son.

---

Not now.

---

Your Henry’s in the vault, you know.

---

## HENRY:
I know; I’ve seen him there.


---

## RICHARD:
I’ll have the crown.

---

## HENRY:
You’ll have what daddy gives you.

---

## RICHARD:
I am next in line.

---

## HENRY:
To nothing.

---

## RICHARD:
Then we’ll have the broadswords now.

---

## HENRY:
This minute?

---

## RICHARD:
On the battlefield.

---

## HENRY:
So, we’re at war.


---

## RICHARD:
Yes, we’re at war.

---

I have two thousand men at Poitiers.


---

## HENRY:
Can they hear you?

---

Call and see who comes.

---

You are as close to Poitiers as you’re going to get.


---

## RICHARD:
You don’t dare hold me prisoner.

---

## HENRY:
You’re a king’s son so I treat you with respect.

---

You have the freedom of the castle.


---

## RICHARD:
You can’t keep me here.

---

## HENRY:
Until we’ve all agreed that John comes next, I can and will.


---

## RICHARD:
The castle doesn’t stand that holds me.

---

Post your guards.

[Richard loudly stomps up the stairs]

---

## JOHN:
My God.

---

I’m king again.

---

Fantastic.

---

It’s a miracle.
Are you happy for me Geoff?

---

## GEOFFREY:
I am happy for us both.

---

## ELEANOR:
I came close, didn’t I?

I almost had my freedom and I almost had you for my son.

---

I should have liked it being free.
You played it nicely.

---

You were good.


---

## HENRY:
I really was.

---

I fooled you, didn’t I?

---

God, but do I love being king.


---

## ELEANOR:
Well, Henry, liege and lord, what happens now?


---

## HENRY:
I have no idea.

---

I know I’m winning and I know I’ll win but what the next move is –
You’re not scared?

---

## ELEANOR:
No.

---

## HENRY:
I think you are.

---

## ALAIS:
I was.

---

You mustn’t play with feelings, Henry; not with mine.


---

## HENRY:
It wasn’t possible to lose you.

---

I must hold you dearer than I thought.

---

You’ve got your enigmatic face on.

---

“What’s your mood, I wonder?”


---

## ELEANOR:
Pure delight.


---

I’m locked up with my sons: what mother wouldn’t dream of that?

---

One thing.

---

## HENRY:
Yes?

---

## ELEANOR:
May I watch you kiss her?

---

## HENRY:
Can’t you ever stop?

---

## ELEANOR:
I watch you every night.

---

I conjure it before I sleep.

---

## HENRY:
Leave it at that.

[harp plucked over somber cello music]

---

## ELEANOR:
My curiosity is intellectual: I want to see how accurate I am.


---

## HENRY:
Forget the dragon in the doorway: come.
Believe I love you, for I do.

---

Believe I’m yours forever, for I am.

---

Believe in my contentment and the joy you give me and believe –

---


You want more?
I’m an old man in an empty place.

---

Be with me.

[louder harp is played over cello]

---
---
<!-- INTERMISSION -->
---
---

[soft, slow, melancholic harp music plays]

---

## ELEANOR:
How beautiful you make me.

---

What might Solomon have sung had he seen this?
I can’t.

---

I’d turn to salt.
I’ve lost again.

---

I’m done, for now.

---

Well – there’ll be other Christmases.

---

I'd hang them from the nipples but it'd shock the children.

---

They kissed sweetly, didn’t they?

---

I’ll have him next time.

---

I can wait.
Ah, there you are; my comfort and my company.

---

We’re locked in for another year: four seasons more.

---

Oh, what a desolation, what a life’s work.
[harp music ends]

---

Is it too much?

---

Be sure to squint as you approach.

---

You may be blinded by my beauty.


---

## GEOFFREY:
Richard’s raging all around the castle

---

## ELEANOR:
Is he?

---

Why?


---

## GEOFFREY:
He says it’s got to do with being held a prisoner, but I think he likes to rage.

---

## ELEANOR:
And John?


---

## GEOFFREY:
John’s skipping after Richard, saying naughty things.

---

## ELEANOR:
And you?

---

## GEOFFREY:
I thought you might be lonely.

---

## ELEANOR:
Here, Chancellor.

---

Try it on for size.


---

## GEOFFREY:
Why do you think so little of me?


---

## ELEANOR:
Little?

---

Never that.

---

Whatever you are, you’re not little.


---

## GEOFFREY:
I remember my third birthday.

---

Not just pictures of the garden or the gifts, but who did what to whom and how it felt.

---

My memory reaches back that far and never once can I remember anything from you or Father warmer than indifference.

---

Why is that?


---

## ELEANOR:
I don’t know.

---

## GEOFFREY:
That was not an easy question for me and I don’t deserve an easy answer.


---

## ELEANOR:
There are times I think we loved none of our children.

---

## GEOFFREY:
Still too easy, don’t you think?

---

## ELEANOR:
I’m weary and you want a simple answer, and I haven’t one.
I read minds.

---

In yours, a shapely hand is writing, “Clever Mother, what’s your clever reason for this clever talk?”

---

I’m so sick of all of you.

[necklace heavily falls into jewelry box and lid shuts]

---

## JOHN:
I thought I’d come and gloat a little.


---

## ELEANOR:
Mother’s tired.

---

Come and stick pins tomorrow morning; I’ll be more responsive then.


---

## JOHN:
It’s not fun goading anyone tonight.


---

## ELEANOR:
Come, let me look at you.

---

I’m full of looks this evening.

---

I have looked a little in the mirror and I’ve read a passage in your brother’s mind; what’s there to see in you?

---

A little me, a little Henry, and a lot of some – one I don’t know.
Oh, John.

[Richard screams angrily while walking into the room]


---

## RICHARD:
The bastard’s boxed us up.

---

## ELEANOR:
What’s that, dear?

---

## RICHARD:
I’ve got to go to Poitiers.

---

Henry wants a war; I’ll give him one.

---

## ELEANOR:
I don’t see how.

---

## RICHARD:
You seem to take that calmly.

---

## ELEANOR:
Well?

---

## RICHARD:
It was – correct me if I’m wrong, but it was my impression that you wanted Henry’s throne for me.


---

## ELEANOR:
We’ve lost this time, Richard.

---

We can’t win.


---

## RICHARD:
You think I’m finished, do you?

---

## ELEANOR:
So I do.

---

I’ve suffered more defeats than you have teeth.

---

I know one when it’s here.


---

## RICHARD:
I will be king.

---

## ELEANOR:
And so you will.

---

But not this year – and what’s it matter to me anyway?

---

The world stops when I die.


---

## RICHARD:
Yours does; mine doesn’t.

---

## ELEANOR:
Leave it, Richard.

---

Let it go for now.

---

I have.

---

## RICHARD:
I can’t.

---

## JOHN:
It’s not so hard.

---

Trying saying after me: John wins, I lose.


---

## RICHARD:
What if John died?

---

## JOHN:
What’s that?

---

## RICHARD:
What if he left us suddenly.

---

## JOHN:
You wouldn’t dare.


---

## RICHARD:
Why on earth wouldn’t I?

---

## JOHN:
A knife – he’s got a knife.


---

## ELEANOR:
Of course, he’s got a knife.

---

He’s always got a knife.

---

We’ve all got knives.

---

It is eleven eighty-three and we’re still barbarians.

---

How clear we make it.

---

Oh, my piglets, we are the origins of war.

---

Not history’s forces nor the times nor justice nor the lack of it nor causes nor religions nor ideas nor kinds of government nor any other thing.

---

We are killers; we breed war.

---

We carry it, like syphilis, inside.

---

Dead bodies rot in field and stream because the living ones are rotten.

---

For the love of God, can’t we love one another just a little?


---

## GEOFFREY:
And while we hugged each other, what would Philip do?


---

## JOHN:
Oh good God – Philip.

---

We’re supposed to start a war.

---

If Father finds out, I’ll be ruined.


---

## GEOFFREY:
Steady, John: don’t panic.

---

## JOHN:
Some advisor you are.

---

## GEOFFREY:
Don’t do anything without me.

---

Let me handle it.


---

## JOHN:
If you’re so clever, why am I always doing something stupid?

---

## ELEANOR:
Well, Geoffrey.

---

He’s made a pact with Philip.

---

You advised John into making war.

*laughs heartily*

---

That peerless boy: he’s disinherited himself.

---

When Henry finds out, when I tell him what John’s done – I need a little time.

---

Can you keep John away from Philip until I say so?

---

## GEOFFREY:
Anything you say.


---

## ELEANOR:
I want you out of Chinon before this breaks.

---

And for that we need Philip.

---

He has soldiers with him if he’ll use them.

---

Go to him, be desperate, promise anything: the Vexin, Brittany.

---

Then once you’re free and John is out of favor, we’ll make further plans.


---

## RICHARD:
You talk to Philip.

---

You’re the diplomat; you see him.


---

## ELEANOR:
You’re a friend.

---

You know him; I don’t.

---

Quickly now.
And, Richard.
Promise anything.
I haven’t lost, it isn’t over.

[slow, steady harp music begins]

---

Oh, I’ve got the old man this time.

---

The damn fool thinks he loves John, he believes it.

---

That’s where the knife goes in.

---

Knives, knives… Oh Henry, we've done a big thing badly.
Where’s that mirror?

---

I am Eleanor and I can look at anything.
My, what a lovely girl.

---

How could her king have left her?

[harp music is replaced by a heavy, thumping beat played over a violin]


---

## GEOFFREY:

[music ends]

[Geoffrey is heard running into the room]

Philip, Philip – is John here?


---

## PHILIP:
Here?

---

In my room?

---

## GEOFFREY:
Come on, Philip; this is me.

---

## PHILIP:
I’ve been expecting him.

---

## GEOFFREY:
If the whole thing breaks tonight; then we’ve reached the end of it.

---

## PHILIP:
If that’s a warning, thank you.


---

## GEOFFREY:
What if it’s an offer?

---

## PHILIP:
“What if” is a game for scholars: what if angels sat on pinheads?

---

## GEOFFREY:
What if I were king?

---

## PHILIP:
It’s your game, Geoff, you play if.

---

## GEOFFREY:
All of England’s land in France, from Normandy down to the Spanish border, once I’m king.


---

## PHILIP:
All that.

---

What could I do that’s worth all that?


---

## GEOFFREY:
By morning I can be the chosen son.

---

The crown can come to me.

---

But once it does, once Henry’s favor falls my way, the war begins.


---

## PHILIP:
We have so many wars.

---

Which one is this?


---

## GEOFFREY:
The one that Richard, John and Eleanor will make.

---

I’ll have to fight to keep what Henry, in his rage, is going to give me.


---

## PHILIP:
Yes, you will.

---

## GEOFFREY:
That’s why I need you, Philip.

---

Will you fight with me against them all?

---

## PHILIP:
Against them all?

---

## GEOFFREY:
Don’t tell me it’s a risk.

---

I wouldn’t hand you half of France to fight an easy war.


---

## PHILIP:
I wouldn’t want you for an enemy.

---

## GEOFFREY:
Are we allies, then?

---

## PHILIP:
We were born to be.


---

## GEOFFREY:
I should say something solemn, but I haven’t time.

---

I’m off to Father with news that John’s a traitor.

---

After that –


---

## JOHN:
You stink, you know that?

---

You’re a stinker and you stink.

---

## GEOFFREY:
Come on.

---

We’re finished here.

---

## JOHN:
I’ll kill you.

---

Where’s a dagger?

---

## GEOFFREY:
Hush, John, or you’ll spoil everything.

---

## JOHN:
A sword, a spear, a candlestick.
It’s light’s out, stinker.


---

## GEOFFREY:
If you’re a prince, there’s hope for every ape in Africa.

---

I had you saved.

---

I wasn’t on my way to Father – but he was.

---

He would have gone to Henry and betrayed you.

---

Look: it’s in his face.


---

## JOHN:
Oh.

---

It’s true.

---

I don’t know who my friends are.


---

## RICHARD:
Philip.


---

## GEOFFREY:
May we?


---

## PHILIP:
That’s what tapestries are for.


---

## JOHN:
I’ve ruined everything.

---

I’ll never learn.


---

## PHILIP:
Is someone there?

---

I heard my name.


---

## RICHARD:
I called it.

---

## PHILIP:
Richard.

---

Hello Richard.

---

## RICHARD:
You’re halfway to bed.

---

I’ll wait for morning.

---

## PHILIP:
Come in.

---

## RICHARD:
Mother sent me.

---

## PHILIP:
Come in anyway.

Our alchemists have stumbled on the art of boiling burgundy.

---

It turns to steam and when it cools, we call it Brandywine.


---

## RICHARD:
I’m Henry’s prisoner.

---

## PHILIP:
So you said you’d go to war and Henry drew the drawbridge on you.

---

## RICHARD:
Do you find that charming?

---

## PHILIP:
No.

---

## RICHARD:
Then why the charming smile?

---

## PHILIP:
I thought, I can’t think why, of when you were in Paris last.

---

Can it be two whole years ago?


---

## RICHARD:
It can.

---

I need an army, Philip.

---

## PHILIP:
It will take the cold away.


---

## RICHARD:
I must have soldiers.

---

## PHILIP:
Have I aged?

---

Do I seem older to you?

---

They’ve been two fierce years: I’ve studied, and I’ve trained to be a king.


---

## RICHARD:
I’ll have your answer – yes or no.

---

## PHILIP:
You’ll have it when I give it.

See?

---

I’ve changed.

---

I’m not the boy you taught to hunt two years ago.

---

Remember?

---

Racing after boar, you flying first, me scrambling after, all day to dusk –

---

## RICHARD:
I’ll try another time.

---

## PHILIP:
Don’t go.


---

## RICHARD:
I must know: will you help me?


---

## PHILIP:
Sit and we’ll discuss it.
You never write.

---

## RICHARD:
To anyone.

---

## PHILIP:
Why should I make you King of England?

---

Aren’t I better off with John or Geoffrey?

---

Why have you to fight when I could have the cretin or the fiend?


---

## RICHARD:
Would we fight?


---

## PHILIP:
We’re fighting now.
Good night.

---

## RICHARD:
You’re still a boy.


---

## PHILIP:
In some ways.

---

Which way did you have in mind?


---

## RICHARD:
You haven’t asked me how much you’re worth to me.

---

## PHILIP:
You’ll tell me.

---

## RICHARD:
You can have the Vexin back.

---

## PHILIP:
And what else?

---

## RICHARD:
All of Brittany.

---

## PHILIP:
That’s Geoffrey’s.

---

## RICHARD:
Does that matter?


---

## PHILIP:
Possibly to Geoffrey.

---

And what else?

---

## RICHARD:
That’s all your help is worth.

---

## PHILIP:
And in return, what do you want from me?

---

## RICHARD:
Two thousand soldiers.

---

## PHILIP:
And what else?

---

## RICHARD:
Five hundred knights on horse.

---

## PHILIP:
And what else?

---

## RICHARD:
Arms and siege equipment.


---

## PHILIP:
And what else?

---

## RICHARD:
I never wrote because I thought you’d never answer.
You got married.

---

## PHILIP:
Does that make a difference?

---

## RICHARD:
Doesn’t it?

---

## PHILIP:
I’ve spent two years on every street in hell.


---

## RICHARD:
That’s odd: I didn’t see you there.
You haven’t said you love me.

[quiet, melancholic violin tune begins]

---

## PHILIP:
When the time comes.

[Richard begins breathing heavily]

---

## HENRY:

[music ends]

(Offstage, calling.)
Philip.

---

## RICHARD:
Don’t go.

---

## PHILIP:
Hush.


---

## RICHARD:
Philip…

Hurry.


---

## HENRY:
(Still offstage.)
Philip, lad.


---

## PHILIP:
Is someone there?


---

## HENRY:
I am.

---

It’s not too late at night?

---

## PHILIP:
I’ve been expecting you.

---

## HENRY:
Oh, have you.

---

## PHILIP:
See – two glasses.

---

I did hope you’d come.


---

## HENRY:
Good; we can’t leave negotiations where they are.

---

I’ve seen more royal rooms. Poor Chinon wasn't meant to sleep so many kings.

---

I keep looking for your father in you.


---

## PHILIP:
He’s not there.

---

## HENRY:
I miss him.

---

Has Richard or the Queen been here to see you?


---

## PHILIP:
Does it matter?

---

If they haven’t, they will.


---

## HENRY:
I want to reach a settlement.

---

I left you with too little earlier.

---

## PHILIP:
Yes, nothing is too little.

---

## HENRY:
I am sorry you’re not fonder of me, lad.

---

Your father always said, “Be fond of stronger men.”


---

## PHILIP:
No wonder he loved everyone.

---

## HENRY:
They’ll offer you whole provinces to fight me.


---

## PHILIP:
Shocking.

---

My advice to you is discipline your children.

---

## HENRY:
I came here to offer peace.


---

## PHILIP:
Piss on your peace.

---

## HENRY:
Your father would have wept.

---

## PHILIP:
My father was a weeper.

---

## HENRY:
Fight me and you’ll lose.

---

## PHILIP:
I can’t lose, Henry.

---

I have time.

---

Just look at you.

---

Your strong arms – they’d crush me like a leaf of lettuce.

---

But each year they get a little weaker.

---

The sand goes pit-pat in the glass.

---

I’m in no hurry, Henry.

---

I’ve got time.


---

## HENRY:
Suppose I hurry things along?

---

What if I say that England is at war with France?


---

## PHILIP:
Then France surrenders.

---

I don’t have to fight to win.

---

Take all you want – this county, that one.

---

You won’t keep it long.


---

## HENRY:
What kind of courage have you got?

---

## PHILIP:
The tidal kind: it comes and goes.

---

## HENRY:
By God, I’d love to turn you loose on Eleanor.

---

More Brandywine?

---

## PHILIP:
You recognize it?

---

## HENRY:
They were boiling it in Ireland before the snakes left.

---

Well, things look a little bleak for Henry, don’t they?

---

You’ll say yes to Richard when he comes; arms, soldiers, anything he asks for.


---

## PHILIP:
I’d be foolish not to.

---

## HENRY:
And withdraw it all before the battle ever started.

---

## PHILIP:
Wouldn’t you, in my place?


---

## HENRY:
Why fight Henry when his sons will do it for you?

---

## PHILIP:
Yes, exactly.

---

## HENRY:
You’ve got promise, lad.

---

That’s first class thinking.

---

## PHILIP:
Thank you, sir.


---

## HENRY:
Good night.

---

## PHILIP:


Good night?

---

You’re going?

---

But we haven’t settled anything.


---

## HENRY:
We open Christmas packages at noon.

---

Till then.


---

## PHILIP:
You can’t be finished with me.

---

## HENRY:
But I am.

---

And it’s been very satisfactory.

---

## PHILIP:
What’s so satisfactory?

---

## HENRY:
Winning is.

---

I did just win.

---

Surely you noticed.


---

## PHILIP:
Not a thing.

---

You haven’t won a damn thing.


---

## HENRY:
I’ve found out the way your mind works and the kind of man you are.

---

I know your plans and expectations.

---

You have burbled every bit of strategy you’ve got.

---

I know exactly what you’ll do and exactly what you won’t.

---

And I’ve told you exactly nothing.

---

To these aged eyes, boy, that’s what winning looks like.

---

Dormez bien.


---

## PHILIP:
One time, when I was very small, I watched some soldiers take their dinner pig and truss it up and put the thing, alive and kicking, on the fire.

---

That’s the sound I’m going to hear from you.


---

## HENRY:
And I thought you lacked passion.


---

## PHILIP:
You – you made my father nothing.

---

You were always better.

---

You bullied him, you bellied with his wife, you beat him down in every war, you twisted treaty and then you made him love you for it.

---

I was there: his last words went to you.


---

## HENRY:
He was a loving man and you learned nothing of it.


---

## PHILIP:
I learned how much fathers live in sons.

---

A king like you has policy prepared on everything.

---

What’s the official line on sodomy?

---

How stands the Crown on boys who do with boys?


---

## HENRY:
Richard finds his way into so many legends.

---

Let’s hear yours and see how it compares.


---

## PHILIP:
He found me first when I was fifteen.

---

We were hunting.

---

It was nearly dark.

---

I lost my way.

---

My horse fell.

---

I was thrown.

---

I woke to Richard touching me.

---

He asked me if I loved him – Philip, do you love me?

---

– and I told him yes.


---

## HENRY:
I’ve heard much better.

---

## PHILIP:
You know why I told him yes?

---

So one day I could tell you all about it.

---

You cannot imagine what that yes cost.

---

Or perhaps you can.

---

Imagine snuggling to a poxied, chancred whore and, bending back your lips in something like a smile, saying, “Yes I love you and I find you beautiful.” 

---

I don’t know how I did it.

---

## RICHARD:
No!

---

It wasn’t like that.

---

## PHILIP:
But it was.

---

## RICHARD:
You loved me.

---

## PHILIP:
Never.

---

## RICHARD:
Get your sword.

---

You’ve got one.

---

Pick it up.


---

## PHILIP:
He’s your responsibility; you talk to him.

---

## RICHARD:
Get out.

---

Please!

---

I don’t want you here.

---

## HENRY:
It’s no great joy to be here.

---

## RICHARD:
So the royal corkscrew finds me twisted, does he?


---

## HENRY:
I’ll go tell your mother: she’ll be pleased.

---

## RICHARD:
She knows: she sent me here.

---

## HENRY:
How completely hers you are.


---

## RICHARD:
You’ve had four sons.

---

Who do you claim?

---

Not my buried brother, Henry?

---

Not that monument to muck, that epic idiot, oh, surely not.


---

## HENRY:
The boy is dead.

---

## RICHARD:
Let’s praise him, then.

---

Who can forget his Roquefort smile, his absent brow, those apey eyes, that spoon edged mind?

---

Why him?

---

Why him and never me?


---

## HENRY:
He was the oldest.

---

He came first.

---

## RICHARD:
Christ, Henry, is that all?

---

## HENRY:
You went with Eleanor.

---

## RICHARD:
You never called for me.

---

You never said my name.

---

I would have walked or crawled.

---

I’d have done anything.


---

## HENRY:
It’s not my fault.

---

I won’t be blamed.

---

## RICHARD:
I only wanted you.

---

## HENRY:
No – it’s my crown.

---

You want my kingdom.

---

## RICHARD:
Keep your kingdom.

---

## HENRY:
That I will.

---

## RICHARD:
I hope it kills you.

---

## HENRY:
I thank God I have another son.

---

Thank God for John.


---

## GEOFFREY:
Who shall we thank for Geoffrey?
You don’t think much of me.

---

## HENRY:
Much?

---

I don’t think of you at all.

---

## GEOFFREY:
Nurse used to say I had your hands; I might have more of you.

---

Try seeing me.

---

I haven’t Richard’s military skill; but he was here betraying you, not I.

---

I haven’t John’s I don’t know what – God knows what you can see in John – and he’s betrayed you, too.

---

There’s only me.


---

## HENRY:
You think I’d ever make you king?

---

## GEOFFREY:
You’ll make me king because I’m all you’ve got.
I was to be his chancellor.

---

Ask him why.

---

## HENRY:
I’ve heard enough.


---

## GEOFFREY:
For moving John to treason.

---

## HENRY:
I don’t doubt he offered, I don’t doubt you tried, and I don’t doubt John loves me.


---

## GEOFFREY:
Like a glutton loves his lunch.


---

## JOHN:
You turd.

---

## PHILIP:
I leave you now.

---

I would not want my presence to temper the festivities.

---

## HENRY:
Well, John?

---

## JOHN:
It isn’t what you think.


---

## HENRY:
What do I think?

---

## JOHN:
What Geoffrey said.

---

I wouldn’t plot against you, ever.

---

## HENRY:
I know; you’re a good boy.

---

## JOHN:
Can I go now, please?

---

It’s late.

---

I ought to be in bed.

---

## HENRY:
You fool.

---

## JOHN:
Me?

---

What have I done now?

---

## HENRY:
Couldn’t you wait?

---

Couldn’t you trust me?

---

It was all yours.

---

Couldn’t you believe that?


---

## JOHN:
Will you listen to the grief?


---

## HENRY:
Who do you think I built this kingdom for?


---

## JOHN:
Me?

---

Daddy did it all for me?


When can I have it, Daddy?

---

Not until we bury you?


---

## HENRY:
You’re just like them.

---

And after all I’ve given you.

---

## JOHN:
I know what you gave.

[yelps after being slapped]

---

## HENRY:
I loved you.

---

## JOHN:
You’re a cold and bloody bastard, you are, and you don’t love anything.


---

## GEOFFREY:
I’m it, I’m all that’s left.

---

Here, Father; here I am.


---

## HENRY:
My life, when it is written, will read better than it lived.

[quiet, melancholic violin plays]

---

Henry Fitz-Empress, first Plantagenet, a king at twenty-one, the ablest soldier of an able time.

---


He led men well, he cared for justice when he could and ruled for thirty years, a state as great as Charlemagne’s.

---

He married, out of love, a woman of legend.

---

Not in Alexandria or Rome or Camelot has there been such a queen.

---

She bore him many children – but no sons.

---

King Henry had no sons.

---

He had three whiskered things but he disowned them.

---

You’re not mine.

---

I deny you.

---

None of you will get my crown.

---

I leave you nothing and I wish you plague.

---

May all your children breech and die.
You dare to damn me, do you?

---

Well, I damn you back.

---

God damn you.

---

All my boys are gone.

---

I’ve lost my boys.

---

Oh Jesus, all my boys.

[loud, thumping drum and energetic violin music plays]

---

[drums and violin with heavy medieval tune play]

---

## ALAIS:


(Singing softly)
♪The Christmas wine is in the pot, The Christmas coals are red.♪
♪I’ll spend my day, The lovers’ way♪

---


♪Unwrapping my gifts in bed.♪

---

♪The Christmas goose is on the spit,♪
♪The Christmas…♪


---

## ELEANOR:
No one else is caroling tonight.

---

It might as well be Lent.

---

## ALAIS:
Henry isn’t here.

---

## ELEANOR:
Good; we can talk behind his back.


---

## ALAIS:
He’s outside walking.

---

## ELEANOR:
In this cold?

---

## ALAIS:
He’ll never notice it.

---

What happened?

---

## ELEANOR:
Don’t you know?

---

## ALAIS:
He came and stood awhile by the fire and went away.

---

You would have liked the way he looked.


---

## ELEANOR:
There was a scene with beds and tapestries and many things got said.

---

Spiced wine: I’d forgotten Henry liked it.

---

May I stay?


---

## ALAIS:
It’s your room just as much as mine: we’re both in residence.


---

## ELEANOR:
Packed in, like the poor, three to a bed.


---

## ALAIS:
Did you love Henry – ever?

---

## ELEANOR:
Ever?

---

Back before the flood?

---

## ALAIS:
As long ago as Rosamund.

---

## ELEANOR:
Ah, that’s pre-history, lamb; there are no written records or survivors.


---

## ALAIS:
There are pictures.

---

She was prettier than you.


---

## ELEANOR:
Oh much.

---

Her eyes, in certain light, were violet and all her teeth were even.

---

That’s a rare feature, even teeth.

---

She smiled to excess but she chewed with real distinction.


---

## ALAIS:
And you hate her even now.


---

## ELEANOR:
No, but I did.

---

He put her in my place, you see, and that was very hard.

---

Like you, she headed Henry’s table; and that’s my chair.


---

## ALAIS:
And so you had her poisoned.

---

## ELEANOR:
That’s a folk tale.

---

Oh, I prayed for her to drop and sang a little when she did but even Circe had her limits.

---

No, I never poisoned Rosamund.

---

Why aren’t you happy?

---

Henry’s keeping you.

---

You must be cleverer than I am.


---

## ALAIS:
Green becomes you.

---

You must always wear it.

---

## ELEANOR:
Are you dressing me in envy?

---

## ALAIS:
I’ve tried feeling pity for you, but it keeps turning into something else.

---

## ELEANOR:
Why pity?


---

## ALAIS:
You love Henry but you love his kingdom, too.

---

You look at him and you see cities, acreage, coastline, taxes.

---

All I see is Henry.

---

Leave him to me, can’t you?


---

## ELEANOR:
But I left him years ago.

---

## ALAIS:
You are untouchable.

---

And I thought I could move you.

---

Were you always like this?

---

Years ago, when I was young and worshipped you, is this what you were like?


---

## ELEANOR:
Most likely.

---

Child, I’m finished and I’ve come to give him anything he asks for.


---

## ALAIS:
Do you know what I should like for Christmas?

---

I should like to see you suffer.


---

## ELEANOR:
Alais, just for you.


---

## ALAIS:
Maman, oh Maman.

---

## ELEANOR:
The Christmas wine will make you warm –
Don’t shiver, child.

---

## ALAIS:
I’m not.

---

## ELEANOR:
The Christmas logs will glow.
There’s Christmas cheer and comfort here –
Is that you crying?

---

## ALAIS:
Non, Maman.

---

## ELEANOR:
Hold close and never let me go.


---

## HENRY:
The sky is pocked with stars.

---

What eyes the three wise men must have had to spot a new one in so many.


---

## ELEANOR:
You look cold.

---

## ALAIS:
I’ve mulled some wine.

---

## HENRY:
I wonder, were there fewer stars then – I don’t know.
What’s this?

---

## ALAIS:
Warm wine.

---

## HENRY:
Why, so it is.

You are as beautiful as I remembered.
Off to bed.

---

My widow wants to see me.


---

## ALAIS:
Let me stay.

---

## HENRY:
Wait up for me.

---

I won’t be long.

---

## ALAIS:
She came to find out what your plans are.

---

## HENRY:
I know that.

---

## ALAIS:
She wants you back.


---

## HENRY:
Old as I am?

---

## ELEANOR:
Old as you are.


---

## ALAIS:
Oh, eat each other up for all I care.
I’m an orphan and I’ll never have a husband and my lover’s wife has fangs for teeth and everybody’s going to die.

---

We’ve got no Romans and no Christians but the rest of the arena, that we have.


---

## ELEANOR:
I’m rather proud; I taught her all the rhetoric she knows.

---

## HENRY:
So, you want me back.

---

## ELEANOR:
She thinks I do.

---

She thinks the need for loving never stops.


---

## HENRY:
She’s got a point.

---

I marvel at you: after all these years, still like a democratic drawbridge, going down for everybody.


---

## ELEANOR:
At my age, there’s not much traffic anymore.


---

## HENRY:
To your interminable health.
Well, wife, what’s on your mind?

---

## ELEANOR:
Oh, Henry, we have made a mess of it.

---

## HENRY:
Yes, haven’t we.

---

## ELEANOR:
Could we have done it worse?

---

## HENRY:
You look like Doomsday.

---

## ELEANOR:
Late nights do that to me.

---

Am I puffy?


---

## HENRY:
Possibly: it’s hard to tell; there’s all that natural sag.


---

## ELEANOR:
I’ve just seen Richard.

---

## HENRY:
Splendid boy.

---

## ELEANOR:
He says you fought.

---

## HENRY:
We always do.

---

## ELEANOR:
It’s his impression that you plan to disinherit all of them.

---

## HENRY:
I fancy I’ll relent.

---

Don’t you?

---

## ELEANOR:
I don’t much care.

---

In fact, I wonder, Henry, if I care for anything.

---

I wonder if I’m hungry out of habit and if all my lusts, like passions in a poem, aren’t really recollections.


---

## HENRY:
I could listen to you lie for hours.

---

So your lust is rusty.

---

Gorgeous.

---

## ELEANOR:
I’m so tired, Henry.


---

## HENRY:
Sleep, then.

---

Sleep and dream of me with croutons.

---

Henri a la mode de Caen.


---

## ELEANOR:
Henry, stop it.

---

## HENRY:
Eleanor, I haven’t started.

---

## ELEANOR:
What is it you want?

---

You want the day?

---

You’ve carried it.

---

It’s yours.

---

I’m yours.


---

## HENRY:
My what?

---

You are my what?

---

## ELEANOR:
Your anything at all.

---

You want my name on paper?

---

I’ll sign anything.

---

You want the Aquitaine for John?

---

It’s John’s.

---

It’s his, it’s yours, it’s anybody’s.

---

Take it.


---

## HENRY:
In exchange for what?


---

## ELEANOR:
For nothing, for a little quiet, for an end to this, for God’s sake sail me back to England, lock me up and lose the key and let me be alone.

[Henry starts clapping]

---


You have my oath.

---

I give my word.
Oh.

[clapping ends]

---

Well.

---

Well, well…


---

## HENRY:
Would you like a pillow?

---

Footstool?

---

What about a shawl?
Your oaths are profanities.

---

Your word’s a curse.

---

Your name on paper is a waste of pulp.

---

I’m vilifying you, for God’s sake.

---

Pay attention.
Eleanor!
Don’t do that.

---

## ELEANOR:
Like any thinking person, I should like to think there was – I don’t care whose or which – some God.

---

Not out of fear: death is a lark; it’s life that stings.

---

But if there were some God, then I’d exist in his imagination, like Antigone in Sophocles'.

---

I’d have no contradictions, no confusions, no waste parts, or misplaced elements and then, oh, Henry, then I’d make some sense.

---

I’d be a Queen in Arcady and not an animal in chaos.

---

How, from where we started, did we reach this Christmas?


---

## HENRY:
Step by step.

---

## ELEANOR:
What happens to me now?

---

## HENRY:
That’s lively curiosity from such a dead cat.

---

If you want to know my plans, just ask me.


---

## ELEANOR:
Conquer China, sack the Vatican or take the veil; I’m not among the ones who give a damn.

---

Just let me sign my lands to John and go to bed.


---

## HENRY:
No, you’re too kind.

---

I can’t accept.


---

## ELEANOR:
Oh, come on, man.

---

I’ll sign the thing in blood or spit or bright blue ink.

---

Let’s have it done.


---

## HENRY:
Let’s not.

---

No, I don’t think I want your signature on anything.

---

## ELEANOR:
You don’t?

---

## HENRY:
Dear God, the pleasure I still get from goading you.


---

## ELEANOR:
You don’t want John to have my provinces?

---

## HENRY:
Bull’s eye.

---

## ELEANOR:
I can’t bear you when you’re smug.

---

## HENRY:
I know, I know.


---

## ELEANOR:
You don’t want Richard and you don’t want John.

---

## HENRY:
You’ve grasped it.

---

## ELEANOR:
All right.

---

Level me.

---

What do you want?

---

## HENRY:
A new wife.

---

## ELEANOR:
Oh.

---

## HENRY:
Aesthete and poetaster that you are, you worship beauty and simplicity.

---

I worship with you.

---

Down with all that’s ugly and complex, like frogs or pestilence or our relationship.

---

I ask you, what’s more beautiful and simple than a new wife?


---

## ELEANOR:
So, I’m to be annulled.

---

Well, will the Pope annul me, do you think?


---

## HENRY:
The Pontif owes me one Pontificate; I think he will.

---

## ELEANOR:
Out Eleanor, in Alais.

---

Why?

---

## HENRY:
Why?

---

Not since Ceasar, seeing Brutus with the bloody dagger in his hand, asked, “You, too?” has there been a dumber question.


---

## ELEANOR:

I stand by it. Why?

---

## HENRY:

A new wife, wife, will bear me sons.

---

## ELEANOR:
That is the single thing of which I should have thought you had enough.

---

## HENRY:
I want a son.

---

## ELEANOR:
Whatever for?

---

Why, we could populate a country town with girls who’ve born you sons.

---

How many is it?

---

Help me count the bastards.


---

## HENRY:
All my sons are bastards.

---

## ELEANOR:
You really mean to do it.


---

## HENRY:
Lady love, with all my heart.

---

## ELEANOR:
Your sons are part of you.

---

## HENRY:
Like warts and goiters – and I’m having them removed.


---

## ELEANOR:
We made them.

---

They’re our boys.


---

## HENRY:
I know.

---

And good God, look at them.

---

Young Henry: vain, deceitful, weak and cowardly.

---

The only patriotic thing he ever did was die.


---

## ELEANOR:
I thought you loved him most.

---

## HENRY:
I did.

---

And Geoffrey: there’s a masterpiece.

---

He isn’t flesh: he’s a device; he’s wheels and gears.


---

## ELEANOR:
Well, every family has one.


---

## HENRY:
But not four.

---

Then Johnny.

---

Was his latest treason your idea?


---

## ELEANOR:
John has so few ideas; no, I can’t bring myself to claim it.


---

## HENRY:
I have caught him lying and I’ve said he’s young.

---

I’ve seen him cheating and I’ve thought he’s just a boy.

---

I’ve watched him steal and whore and whip his servants and he’s not a child.

---

He’s the man we’ve made him.


---

## ELEANOR:
Don’t share John with me; he’s your accomplishment.


---

## HENRY:
And Richard’s yours.

---

How could you send him off to deal with Philip?


---

## ELEANOR:
I was tired.

---

I was busy.

---

They were friends.


---

## HENRY:
Eleanor, he was the best.

---

The strongest, bravest, handsomest and from the cradle one you cradled him.

---

I never had a chance.


---

## ELEANOR:
You never wanted one.

---

## HENRY:
How do you know?

---

You took him.

---

Separation from your husband you could bear.

---

But not your boy.


---

## ELEANOR:
Whatever I have done, you made me do.


---

## HENRY:
You threw me out of bed for Richard.


---

## ELEANOR:
Not until you threw me out for Rosamund.


---

## HENRY:
It’s not that simple.

---

I won’t have it be that simple.

---

## ELEANOR:
I adored you.

---

## HENRY:
Never.


---

## ELEANOR:
I still do.

---

## HENRY:
Of all the lies, that one is the most terrible.


---

## ELEANOR:
I know: that’s why I saved it up for now.

[light, suspenseful drumming begins]


---

[Henry audibly groans from pulling a muscle and the two laugh]

Oh, Henry, we have mangled everything we’ve touched.


---

## HENRY:
Deny us what you will, we have done that.

---

And all for Rosamund.


---

## ELEANOR:
No, you were right: it is too simple.

---

Life, if it’s like anything at all, is like an avalanche.

---

To blame the little ball of snow that starts is all, to say it is the cause, is just as true as it is meaningless.


---

## HENRY:
Do you remember when we met?

[melancholic violin begins to play]

---

## ELEANOR:
Down to the hour and the color of your stockings.


---

## HENRY:
I could hardly see you for the sunlight.

---

## ELEANOR:
It was raining but no matter.

---

## HENRY:
There was very little talk as I recall it.

---

## ELEANOR:
Very little.

---

## HENRY:
I had never seen such beauty – and I walked right up and touched it.

---

God, where did I find the gall to do that?


---

## ELEANOR:
In my eyes?


---

## HENRY:
I loved you.

---

## ELEANOR:
No annulment.

[violin stops]


---

## HENRY:
What?

---

## ELEANOR:
There will be no annulment.

---

## HENRY:
Will there not?

---

## ELEANOR:
No; I’m afraid you’ll have to do without.

---

## HENRY:
Well… it was just a whim.

---

## ELEANOR:
I’m so relieved.

---

I did not want to lose you.


---

## HENRY:
Out of curiosity, as intellectual to intellectual, how in the name of bleeding Jesus can you lose me?

---

Do you ever see me?

---

Am I ever with you?

---

Ever near you?

---

Am I ever anywhere but somewhere else?


---

## ELEANOR:
I’m not concerned about your geographical location.


---

## HENRY:
Do we write?

---

Do I send messages?

---

Do boats bearing gifts float up the Thames to you?

---

Are you remembered?

---

## ELEANOR:

You are.

---

## HENRY:

You’re no part of me. We do not touch at any point. How can you lose me? 


---

## ELEANOR:
Can’t you feel the chains?

---

## HENRY:
You know enough to know I can’t be stopped.


---

## ELEANOR:
But I don’t have to stop you; I have only to delay you.

---

Every enemy you have has friends in Rome.

---

We’ll cost you time.


---

## HENRY:
What is this?

---

I’m not moldering; my paint’s not peeling off.

---

I’m good for years.


---

## ELEANOR:
How many years?

---

Suppose I hold you back for one; I can – it’s possible.

---

Suppose your first son dies; ours did – it’s possible.

---

Suppose you’re daughtered next; we were.

---

How old is Daddy then?

---

What kind of spindly, rickets-ridden, milky, semi-witted, wizened, dim-eyed, gammy-handed, limpy line of things will you beget?


---

## HENRY:
It’s sweet of you to care.

---

## ELEANOR:
And when you die, which is regrettable but necessary, what will happen to frail Alais and her pruney prince?

---

You can’t think Richard’s going to wait for your grotesque to grow?


---

## HENRY:
You wouldn’t let him do a thing like that?


---

## ELEANOR:
Let him?

---

I’d push him through the nursery door.

---

## HENRY:
You’re not that cruel.

---

## ELEANOR:
Don’t’ fret.

---

We’ll wait until you are dead to do it.

---

## HENRY:
Eleanor, what do you want?


---

## ELEANOR:
Just what you want: a king for a son.

---

You can make more.

---

I can’t.

---

You think I want to disappear?

---

One sone is all I’ve got, and you can blot him out and call me cruel.

---

For these ten years You’ve lived with everything I’ve lost and loved another woman through it all.

---

And I’m cruel.

---

I could peel you like a pear and God himself would call it justice.


---

## HENRY:
I will die sometime soon.

---

One day I’ll duck too slow and at Westminster, they’ll sing out Vivat Rex for someone else.

---

I beg you, let it be a son of mine.


---

## ELEANOR:
I am not moved to tears.

---

## HENRY:
I have no sons.

---

## ELEANOR:
You’ve got too many sons.

---

You don’t need more.

---

## HENRY:
Well, wish me luck.

---

I’m off.

---

## ELEANOR:
To Rome?


---

## HENRY:
That’s where they keep the Pope.

---

## ELEANOR:
You don’t dare go.

---

## HENRY:
Say that again at noon, you’ll say it to my horse’s arse.

---

Lamb, I’ll be rid of you by Easter: you can count your reign in days.


---

## ELEANOR:
If you go to Rome, we’ll rise against you.

---

## HENRY:
Who will?

---

## ELEANOR:
Richard, Geoffrey, John, and Eleanor of Aquitaine.


---

## HENRY:
The day those stout hearts band together is the day that pigs get wings.


---

## ELEANOR:
There’ll be pork in the treetops come morning.

---

Don’t you see?

---

You’ve given them a common cause: new sons.

---

You leave the country, and you’ve lost it.


---

## HENRY:
All of you at once.

---

## ELEANOR:
And Philip, too.

---

He’d join us.

---

## HENRY:
Yes, he would.

---

## ELEANOR:
Now how’s your trip to Rome?

---

## HENRY:
You’d truly do this to me?

---

## ELEANOR:
Oh, I’ve got you, got you, got you.


---

## HENRY:
Should I take a thousand men-at-arms to Rome or is that showy?

---

## ELEANOR:
Bluff away.

---

I love it.


---

## HENRY:
Ah, poor thing.

---

How can I break the news?

---

You’ve just miscalculated.

---

## ELEANOR:
Have I?

---

How?

---

## HENRY:
You should have lied to me.

---

You should have promised to be good while I was gone.

---

I would have let your three boys loose.

---

They could have fought me then.


---

## ELEANOR:
You wouldn’t keep your sons locked up here?

---

## HENRY:
Why the devil wouldn’t I?

---

## ELEANOR:
You don’t dare.

---

## HENRY:
Why not?

---

What’s to stop me?

---

Let them sit in Chinon for a while.

---

## ELEANOR:
No; I forbid it!


---

## HENRY:
She forbids it!

---

## ELEANOR:
Did your father sleep with me, or didn’t he?


---

## HENRY:
No doubt you’re going to tell me that he did.

---

## ELEANOR:
Would it upset you?

---

## HENRY:
What about the thousand men?

---

I say be gaudy and to hell with it.


---

## ELEANOR:
Don’t leave me, Henry.

---

I’m at rock bottom, I’ll do anything to keep you.

[soft, suspenseful violin and harp music begins to play]

---

## HENRY:
I think you think you mean it.

---

## ELEANOR:
Ask for something.


---

## HENRY:
Eleanor, we’re past it; years past.

---

## ELEANOR:
Test me.

---

Name an act.

---

## HENRY:
There isn’t one.

---

## ELEANOR:
About my fornication with your father –

---

## HENRY:
Yes, there is.

---

You can expire.

---

## ELEANOR:
You first old man.

---

I only hope I’m there to watch.

---

You’re so afraid of dying.

---

You’re so scared of it.


---

## HENRY:
Poor Eleanor; if only she had lied.

---

## ELEANOR:
She did.

---

She said she never loved your father.


---

## HENRY:
I can always count on you.

---

## ELEANOR:
I’ve never touched you without thinking, “Geoffrey, Geoffrey.”

---

## HENRY:
When you hurt me, I’ll cry out.

---

## ELEANOR:
I’ve put more horns on you than Louis ever wore.

---

## HENRY:
Am I supposed to care?

---

## ELEANOR:
I’ll kill you if you leave me.

---

## HENRY:
You can try.

---

## ELEANOR:
I loved your father’s body.

---

He was beautiful.


---

## HENRY:
It never happened.

---

## ELEANOR:
I can see his body now.

---

Shall I describe it?

---

## HENRY:
Eleanor, I hope you die.

---

## ELEANOR:
His arms were rough, with scars here –

---

## HENRY:
Stop it!

---

## ELEANOR:
I can feel his arms.

---

I feel them.

---

## HENRY:
AAH!

---

## ELEANOR:
What’s that?

---

Have I hurt you?


---

## HENRY:
Oh my God, I’m going to be sick.

---

## ELEANOR:
We did it.

---

You were in the next room when he did it.
Well, what family doesn’t have its ups and downs.?
It’s cold.

---

I can’t feel anything.
Not anything at all.
We couldn’t go back, could we, Henry?

[louder violin and harp music plays]


---

[music ends]


---

## HENRY:
Get up, wake up, it’s morning.

---

## ALAIS:
Henry?

---

What’s wrong?

---

## HENRY:
We’re packing up and moving out.

---

## ALAIS:
Is there a war?

---

What happened?

---

## HENRY:
Merry Christmas.

---

## ALAIS:
Henry, what’s the matter?


---

## HENRY:
Nothing, for a change; would you believe it?

---

## ALAIS:
Where’ve you been all night?

---

## HENRY:
You know what a mesnie is?

---

It’s a train, an entourage.

---

It’s made of soldiers, cooks and clerics, wagons, barrows, linen, treasure, chickens, butts of wine, and spices.

---

I’ve been all night making one.


---

## ALAIS:
What for?

---

## HENRY:
We’re off to Rome to see the Pope.

---

## ALAIS:
He’s excommunicated you again.

---

## HENRY:
He’s going to set me free.

---

I’m having Eleanor annulled.

---

The nation will be shocked to learn our marriage wasn’t consummated.


---

## ALAIS:
What happened last night when I left?

---

## HENRY:
We hugged and kissed a little.

---

## ALAIS:
Oh, be serious.

---

## HENRY:
And then, I told her you and I were getting married.

---

## ALAIS:
Are we?

---

## HENRY:
By the Pope himself.

---

## ALAIS:
You mean it?

---

## HENRY:
Shall I kneel?


---

## ALAIS:
It’s not another trick?

---

## HENRY:
The bridal party’s drilling on the cobblestones.

---

## ALAIS:
She loves you, Henry.

---

## HENRY:
See for yourself.

---

## ALAIS:
She’ll find a way to stop us.

---

## HENRY:
How?

---

She won’t be here.

---

We’re launching her for Salisbury Tower when she winds change.

---

She’ll be barging down the River Vienne by lunchtime.


---

## ALAIS:
If she doesn’t stop us, Richard will.

---

## HENRY:
Suppose I do the worrying.


---

## ALAIS:
He won’t like losing me.

---

## HENRY:
He’s lost a damn sight more than you.

---

I’ve corked him up.

---

## ALAIS:
You’ve what?

---

## HENRY:
He’s in the cellar with his brothers and the wine.

---

The royal boys are aging with the royal port.

---

You haven’t said “yes.” 

---

Would you like a formal declaration?
There – my finest angle; it’s on all the coins.

---

Sad Alais, will you marry me?

---

## ALAIS:
I can’t believe it.

---

## HENRY:
Be my Queen.

---

## ALAIS:
I never hoped for this.

---

I mean, I always hoped but never thought – I mean –


---

## HENRY:
We’ll love each other and you’ll give me sons.

---

## ALAIS:
I don’t know what I mean.

---

## HENRY:
Let’s have five; we’ll do Eleanor one better.

---

Why, I’ll even call the first one Louis if you like.

---

Louis le Premier: how’s that for a King of England?


---

## ALAIS:
Henry, - you can’t ever let them out.

---

## HENRY:
You’ve lost me.

---

Let who out?

---

## ALAIS:
Your sons?

---

You’ve put them in the dungeon, and you’ve got to keep them there forever.


---

## HENRY:
Do I now?


---

## ALAIS:
If they’re free when you die, it’s the dungeon or the nunnery for me.

---

I don’t care which – a cell’s a cell – but, Henry, what about the child?


---

## HENRY:
Don’t bother me with the child.

---

The damn thing isn’t born yet.


---

## ALAIS:
If they’re free, they’ll kill it.

---

I’m the one who’ll live to see that, and I will not see our children murdered.


---

## HENRY:
You don’t make the ultimatums: I do.


---

## ALAIS:
Not this time.

---

Either you keep them down forever or you find yourself another widow.

---

I don’t want the job.


---

## HENRY:
Do you know what you’re asking me to do?

---

## ALAIS:
You locked your Queen up.


---

## HENRY:
But my boys – how can I?

---

## ALAIS:
That’s for you to face.

---

## HENRY:

You have no children.

---

## ALAIS:

And I never will.

---

## HENRY:
But they’re my sons.

---

## ALAIS:
I hate your sons.

---

I’m not the one who wants a new line.

---

If you want it, that’s the price.


---

## HENRY:
You’ll come to Rome if I say so.

---

You’ll marry me if I say so.

---

The boys go free if I say so.

---

My terms are the only terms.

---

The difficulty is, you see, the difficulty is you’re right.

---

Incredible, but I have children who would murder children.

---

Every time I’ve read Medea I’ve thought: “No; the thing’s absurd.

---

Fish eat their young, and foxes: but not us.”

---

And yet she did it.

---

I imagine she was mad; don’t you?
Yes, mad she must have been.

---

## ALAIS:
Henry – are you going down?


---

## HENRY:
Down?

---

Yes.

---

## ALAIS:
To let them out or to keep them in?


---

## HENRY:
Could you say, to a child of yours, “You’ve seen the sunlight for the last time?”


---

## ALAIS:
Can you do it, Henry?

---

## HENRY:
Well, I’d be a master bastard if I did.

---

## ALAIS:
I must know.

---

Can you?

---

## HENRY:
I shall have to, shan’t I?

[heavy toned cello and harp music plays over drums]

[music ends]


---

## JOHN:
The trick is not to dribble when you bang the bung.
Voila.

---

I had an alcoholic Latin tutor – 
cup -
who taught me all he knew.

---

## GEOFFREY:
Which wasn’t much.

---

## JOHN:
I know I might as well be drunk.

---

## GEOFFREY:
If I were you, I’d be worried.


---

## JOHN:
You know me – cup.
I’d just worry over all the wrong things.


---

## GEOFFREY:
Don’t you know what’s going to happen?


---

## JOHN:
No, and you don’t either.

---

You and your big cerebellum.
“I’m what’s left.

---

Here, Daddy; here I am.” And here you are.

---

## RICHARD:
But not for long.

---

## GEOFFREY:
You think we’re getting out?

---

## RICHARD:
No; deeper in.

---

The fortress at Vaudreuil has dungeons down two-hundred feet.

---

That’s where I’d keep us.


---

## GEOFFREY:
And if I were Father, I’m not sure I’d keep the three of us at all.

---

You don’t take prisoners; no, you don’t.

---

And with good reason.

---

Dungeon doors can swing both ways, but coffins have no hinges.


---

## JOHN:
I know you.

---

You only want to frighten me.


---

## GEOFFREY:
John, the condition of your trousers, be they wet or dry, could not concern me less.

---

I think I’m apt to die today and I am sweating, John.

---

I’m sweating cold.


---

## JOHN:
We’ve got friends.

---

## GEOFFREY:
Name one.

---

## JOHN:
Someone’s got to rescue us.

---

## GEOFFREY:
I can’t think who or how or why.


---

## RICHARD:
He isn’t going to see me beg.

---

He’ll get no satisfaction out of me.


---

## GEOFFREY:
Why, you chivalric fool – as if the way one fell down mattered.


---

## RICHARD:
When the fall is all there is, it matters.

---

## JOHN:
Can’t we run or hide or anything?

---

## RICHARD:
Just in the wine.

[dungeon door can be heard opening]

---

## JOHN:
Geoff –


---

## ELEANOR:
My barge is leaving at eleven and I’ve come to say goodbye.


---

## GEOFFREY:
Does Henry know you’re here?

---

## ELEANOR:
The Queen still has some privileges.

---

I bring you breakfast.

---

## JOHN:
I’m not hungry.

---

## GEOFFREY:
What’s he planning?

---

## RICHARD:
Is he going to keep us here?

---

## ELEANOR:
First, have a little nourishment.

---

## RICHARD:
For God’s sake, Mother –


---

## ELEANOR:
Eat.

[box thuds loudly on dungeon floor]


---

## GEOFFREY:
Well, Eleanor.

---

## RICHARD:
How heavy is the outside guard?

---

## ELEANOR:
There is just the turnkey.

---

## RICHARD:
What about the courtyard and the gates?


---

## ELEANOR:
They’re putting Henry’s train together and its chaos.

---

You can walk right out.


---

## RICHARD:
We’ll go to Poitiers.

---

He’ll expect that but we’ll meet him with an army when he comes.
Keep close to me and when you run, run hard.


---

## GEOFFREY:
Why run at all?

---

I think we ought to stay.

---

## JOHN:
Stay here?

---

## GEOFFREY:
Till Henry comes.

He will come, won’t he – and he’ll come alone.
I count three knives to one.

---

## RICHARD:
You think we could?

---

## JOHN:
I’d only do it wrong.

---

You kill him and I’ll watch.


---

## GEOFFREY:
The three of us together: we must all three do it.

---

I want us all to be responsible.


---

## ELEANOR:
Don’t listen to him.

---

Take the knives and run.

---

## GEOFFREY:
And miss this opportunity?

---

## ELEANOR:
Get out.

---

## GEOFFREY:
I’ll be behind him with John.

---

You’ll want’ to do it from the front.
And you, you lucky girl, you get to see the pageant.


---

## ELEANOR:
Mother’s looking for a name for you – if English has one adequately foul.


---

## GEOFFREY:
Now hold on.

---

I’ve been vilified enough.

---

I’ve had enough of it.

---

You brought the cutlery; you hauled it down here.

---

Don’t you dare tell me this wasn’t in your mind.


---

## ELEANOR:
I tell you.

---

I deny it.

---

## GEOFFREY:
Swear on something.

---

I’m agog to hear what you consider holy.

---

## RICHARD:
Where are you going?

---

## ELEANOR:
Up for air.

---

## GEOFFREY:
Don’t stop her.

---

## RICHARD:
But she’ll warn him.


---

## GEOFFREY:
Let her go.

---

She isn’t going to tell him anything.


---

## ELEANOR:
You think I’m going to let this happen.


---

## GEOFFREY:


If you tattled, there would be a rash of executions and you don’t want that.

---

No, you don’t want to lose a single one of us: not even me.


---

## ELEANOR:
You’re clever but I wonder if you’re right.


---

## GEOFFREY:
Oh, lady, don’t you know where you are?

---

You’re in stalemate.

---

Warn him, it’s the end of us: warn him not and it’s the end of him.

---

It’s that clear.


---

## ELEANOR:
Guard.

---

## GEOFFREY:
Go on, dear.

---

Call again – and pitch it up a little.


---

## ELEANOR:
I’ll have him take the knives away.


---

## RICHARD:
And be the one to put us in Vaudreuil?


---

## ELEANOR:
Then run away, escape.

---

You’ve still got time.

---

## RICHARD:
No.

---

Geoffrey’s right: we’ll stay.

---

## ELEANOR:
You too?

---

Oh, Richard.

---

## RICHARD:
Oh, oh, oh.

---

There’s nothing in your Oh’s: they’re empty.

---

## ELEANOR:
You’re not an assassin.

---

## RICHARD:
Look again.


---

## ELEANOR:
You’re not.

---

You’re my Richard and you love me.


---

## RICHARD:
Let me kiss the nasty scratch and make it well.

---

## ELEANOR:
Yes, do.

---

Come, let me hold you.

---

## RICHARD:
You’re more beautiful than ever.

---

There is much that’s beautiful in evil when it’s absolutely pure.

---

You are so foul, you’re fair.

---

You stand there looking like a saint in pain when you brought us the knives to do your work.


---

## ELEANOR:
That’s not true.

---

## RICHARD:
You did bring these things.

---

## ELEANOR:
Not for this.

---

## RICHARD:
Here – you want him dead, you do it.


---

## ELEANOR:
You unnatural animal.

---

## RICHARD:
Unnatural, Mummy?

---

You tell me, what’s nature’s way?

---

If poisoned mushrooms grow and babies come with crooked backs, if dogs go mad and wives kill husbands, what’s unnatural?

---

Here stands your lamb.

---

Come cover him with kisses; he’s all yours.


---

## ELEANOR:
No, you’re not mine.

---

I’m not responsible.


---

## RICHARD:
Where do you think I learned this from?

---

How old was I when you fought with Henry first?


---

## ELEANOR:
Young…!

---

I don’t know.

---

## RICHARD:
How many battles did I watch?

---

## ELEANOR:
But those were battles, not a knife behind a door.


---

## RICHARD:
I’ve never heard a corpse ask how it got so cold.

---

You’ve a mind: you tell me, what was on it when you had your soldiers point their crossbows at him?


---

## ELEANOR:
That was in the field.

---

## RICHARD:
I don’t care if it was in the dahlia bed.

---

What were you thinking, Eleanor?

---

## ELEANOR:
Of you.

---

## RICHARD:
Of your unnatural animal?

---

## ELEANOR:
I did it all for you.

---

## RICHARD:
You wanted Father dead.

---

## ELEANOR:
No, never that.


---

## RICHARD:
You tried to kill him, didn’t you?

---

## ELEANOR:
Yes.

---

## RICHARD:
Why?

---

What did you want?

---

## ELEANOR:
I wanted Henry back.

---

## RICHARD:
You lie.

---

## ELEANOR:
I wanted Henry.

---

Isn’t there a chair?


---

## JOHN:
Here.


None of that.

---

## ELEANOR:
I’ve done without it this long; I’ll endure.


---

## GEOFFREY:
She’ll warn him.

---

I was wrong.

---

She’ll do it if she gets the chance.

---

## ELEANOR:
Then you’re in a stalemate; aren’t you lamb?

---

## GEOFFREY:
How so?

---

## ELEANOR:
You don’t dare let me stay here and you don’t dare let me out.

---

Dear me, whatever shall we do with Mother?


---

## GEOFFREY:
Offhand there are several possibilities.

[dungeon door can be heard opening]

---

## JOHN:
Watch it.


---

## HENRY:
It wants light.

---

What we do in dungeons needs the shades of day.

---

I stole the candles from the chapel.

---

No one minded.

---

Jesus won’t begrudge them, and the chaplain works for me.

---

## ELEANOR:
You look dreadful.

---

## HENRY:
So do you.

---

## ELEANOR:
I under slept a little.

---

## HENRY:
We can all rest in a little while.

---

That’s better.

---

Bright and clear, just like the morning.


---

## ELEANOR:
Here.

---

I’ll take the breakfast things.


---

## RICHARD:
Not yet.

---

## ELEANOR:
They’ve gone cold.

---

## RICHARD:
They’re good cold.

---

## HENRY:
Listen to me.

---

What’s the answer.

---

Can I ever let you out?


---

## RICHARD:
What do you want from us?

---

You must be mad.

---

Damn you.

---

Why did you have to come here?

---

## HENRY:
You think I want to lock you up?

---

## RICHARD:
You’ve got to.

---

You can’t let me out.

---

You know you can’t.

---

I’ll never stop.

---

## HENRY:
I can’t stop either.


---

## RICHARD:
There’s only fighting left.

---

## HENRY:
Not even that.

---

What have you got to fight me with?


---

## ELEANOR:
My children.

---

In the past, I’ve come and gone and loved you when it suited me.

---

I never nursed you, weaned you, washed you, fed you, but today I felt such love for each of you and so I brought you breakfast.


---

## RICHARD:
Mother.

---

## HENRY:
Let her be.

---

## ELEANOR:
I thought I had no other choice, but I was wrong again.


---

## HENRY:
Bravo boys: that’s what I have.

---

Three warriors.

---

Who had first crack?

---

How was I divided up?

---

Christ –


---

## RICHARD:
You drove us to it.

---

## HENRY:
Don’t stop now.

---

You’re killers, aren’t you?

---

I am.

---

I can do it.

[knives clang on dungeon floor]

Take a knife.
Come on.

---

What is it?

---

Come for me.

---

## RICHARD:
I can’t.

---

## HENRY:
You’re Richard, aren’t you?

---

## RICHARD:
But you’re Henry.


---

## HENRY:
Please.

---

We can’t stop and we can’t go back.

---

There’s nothing else.


---

## JOHN:
Daddy?

---

Take me back.

---

Please.

---

Can’t we try again?

[slow paced, melancholic cello plays]

---

## HENRY:
Again?

---

## JOHN:
We always have before.

---

## HENRY:
Oh yes…we always have.

---

## JOHN:
Oh, Daddy.

---

## ELEANOR:
Go on.

---

Execute them.

---

You’re the King.

---

You’ve judged.

---

You’ve sentenced.

---

You know how.


---

## HENRY:
By God, I will.

---

Come Monday and they’ll hang you with the washing.

---

There’ll be princes swinging from the Christmas trees.


---

## ELEANOR:
Why wait?

---

They are assassins, aren’t they?

---

This was treason, wasn’t it?

---

You gave them life, you take it.


---

## HENRY:
Who’s to say it’s monstrous?

---

I’m the King.

---

I call it just.

---

Therefore, I Henry, by the Grace of God King of the English, Lord of Scotland, Ireland and Wales, Count of Anjou, Brittany, Poitou and Normandy, Maine, Gascony, and Aquitaine, do sentence you to death.

---

Done this Christmas Day in Chinon in God’s year eleven eighty-three.

[cello music ends]

---

Surely that’s not what I intended.

---

Children…Children are…They’re all we have.
Go on.

---

I’m done.

---

I’m done.

---

I’m finished with you.

---

Never come again.


---

## JOHN:
Aren’t you coming?

---

Father has forgiven us.

---

Hasn’t he Mother?

---

All is well again.


---

## GEOFFREY:
No, he has not.

---

He releases his prey just to have the joy of hunting them again.


---

## RICHARD:
Geoffrey is right.

---

Father, Mother, the matter of Alais and the Vexin are still at hand.

---

Therefore I, Richard the Lionheart, Duke of Normandy, Duke of Gascony, Lord of Cyprus, Count of Anjou, Count of Maine, Count of Nantes, and Overlord of Aquitaine; consider this just a postponement.


---

## ELEANOR:
You spare the rod, you’ll spoil those boys.

---

## HENRY:
I couldn’t do it, Eleanor.

---

## ELEANOR:
Nobody thought you could.


---

## HENRY:
I did.

---

## ALAIS:
You saved them.

---

You maneuvered it.

---

## ELEANOR:
Did I?

---

## ALAIS:
They’re free because of you.

---

They’ll kill him one day; you know that.

---

## ELEANOR:
The next time or the next.

---

## ALAIS:
You always win, Maman.

---

## ELEANOR:
Except the prize.

---

## ALAIS:
Come rest.


---

## HENRY:
I want no women in my life.

---

## ALAIS:
You’re tired.

---

## HENRY:
I could have conquered Europe, all of it, but I had women in my life.

---

## ALAIS:
I’ll warm some wine.

---

## HENRY:
I’ve shot your world and there you stand, all honey and molasses.

---

Sweet?

---

You make my teeth ache.


---

## ELEANOR:
That’s touching.

---

Is it for my benefit?

---

## HENRY:
Your benefit?
Get out.

---

Go on.

---

Go.

---

## ALAIS:


When you want me, I’ll be waiting.

---


---

## HENRY:
I should have killed you years ago.


---

## ELEANOR:
There’s no one peeking.

---

Do it now.


---

## HENRY:
I’ve wasted fortunes, squandered lives, spent everything – to but this pit.

---

I’ve got an eye for value.

---

This is what I’ve made.

---

I meant to do so much.


---

## ELEANOR:
Is this a play for pity?

---

## HENRY:
Not from you.

---

You put me here.

---

You made me do mad things.

---

You’ve bled me.


---

## ELEANOR:
Shoulder it yourself.

---

Don’t put it on my back.

---

You’ve done what you have done and no one but yourself has made you do it.

---

Pick it up and carry it.


---

I can.

---

My losses are my work.


---

## HENRY:
What losses?

---

I’ve been cheated, not you.

---

I’m the one with nothing.


---

## ELEANOR:
Lost your life’s work, have you?

---

Provinces are nothing: land is dirt: I’ve lost you.

---

I can’t ever have you back again.

---

You haven’t suffered.

---

I could take defeats like yours and laugh.

---

I’ve done it.

---

If you’re broken it’s because you’re brittle.

---

You are all that I have ever loved.

---

Christ, you don’t know what nothing is.

---

I want to die.


---

## HENRY:
You don’t.

---

## ELEANOR:
I want to die.

[light, sorrowful harp plays]

---

## HENRY:
I’ll hold you.

---

## ELEANOR:
I want to die.

---

## HENRY:
Stop saying that.

---

Let me do something, damn you.

---

This is terrible.


---

## ELEANOR:
Henry, I want to die.

---

## HENRY:
You will, you know.

---

Wait long enough and it’ll happen.

---

## ELEANOR:
So it will.

---

## HENRY:
We’re in the cellar and you’re going back to prison and my life is wasted and we’ve lost each other and you’re smiling.


---

## ELEANOR:
It’s the way I register despair. There's everything in life but hope.

---

## HENRY:
We have each other and for all I know that’s what hope is.

---


## ELEANOR:
We’re jungle creatures, Henry, and the dark is all around us.

---

See them?

---

In the corners, you can see the eyes.


---

## HENRY:
And they can see ours.

---

I’m a match for anything.

---

Aren’t you?


---

## ELEANOR:
I should have been a great fool not to love you.


---

## HENRY:
Come along; I’ll see you to your ship.

---

## ELEANOR:
So soon?

---

## HENRY:
There’s always Easter Court.

---

## ELEANOR:
You’ll let me out for Easter?

---

## HENRY:
Come the resurrection, you can strike me down again.

---

## ELEANOR:
Perhaps I’ll do it next time.

---

## HENRY:
And perhaps you won’t.

---

## ELEANOR:
It must be late, and I don’t want to miss the tide.

[light violin and cello music plays]


---

## HENRY:
You know, I hope we never die.

---

## ELEANOR:
I hope so, too.

---

## HENRY:
You think there’s any chance of it?
