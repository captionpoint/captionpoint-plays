## Barack Obama
[On the TV giving a speech]
Already we've brought home 33,000 of our brave service men and women.

---

This spring our forces will move into a support role and Afghan security forces will take the lead.

---

Tonight I can announce that over the next year another 34,000 American troops will come home from Afghanistan

---

This drawdown will continue.  And by the end of next year, our war in Afghanistan will be over. 

---

[tv static]
[sounds of airplanes and other vehicles]

---

---

[baby crying next-door]

---

[furious typing]

---

[movement outside]

---

## AFIYA:
[offstage]
He won’t sleep?

---

## LEYLA:
[offstage]
He won’t even close his eyes.

## AFIYA:
[offstage]
Poor thing.

---

## LEYLA:
[offstage]
You mean me! I am the poor thing. I’m telling you, he’s trying to kill me.

---

## AFIYA:
[offstage]
He’s not sick?
 
## LEYLA:
[offstage]
No, no. Just vindictive.

---

Aren’t you, Nabil? Aren’t you vindictive?

---

## AFIYA:
[offstage]
I hope you get some rest, Leyla.

---

## LEYLA:
[offstage]
I started some tea, set your things down! 

---

## LEYLA:
Come join me.

## AFIYA:
I can’t.

---

## LEYLA:
Come on, Amir’s mother just left! There is so much to tell you.

---

## AFIYA:
I’ve got this headache, Leyla. I’d better go close my eyes.

---

Like you should, Nabil! Sleep for your mother. She needs her rest.

---

---

## AFIYA:
I’m alone.

---

## TAROON:
So?

---

## AFIYA:
A boy!

---

## TAROON:
Healthy?

## AFIYA:
Yes.

---

## TAROON:
And Bibi?

## AFIYA:
Healthy.

---

## TAROON:
Ten fingers? Ten toes?

## AFIYA:
Yes.

---

## TAROON:
Our cousin. He was missing a pinky.

---

## AFIYA:
I counted them.

---

## TAROON:
A boy.

---

## AFIYA:
A boy.

---

## TAROON:
You held him?

---

## AFIYA:
No, but I touched him. He’s too small to hold.

---

## TAROON:
Too small?

---

## AFIYA:
He’s normal, Taroon. I asked. Everything is normal.

---

## TAROON:
And when you left?

---

## AFIYA:
She was holding him.

---

## TAROON:
Wow.

---

## AFIYA:
Bibi, she looks like she was meant to look. Like a picture.

---

## TAROON:
And she’s well?

---

## AFIYA:
Tired, but she can’t stop smiling.

---

## TAROON:
Was it difficult, for her?

## AFIYA:
Yes.

---

## TAROON:
Did she ask where I was?

---

## AFIYA:
She knows better.

---

## TAROON:
Was she looking around, hoping I might come?

---

## AFIYA:
No, Taroon. She was accomplishing the considerable task of pushing a child into the world.

---

## TAROON:
This isn’t right. I should have been there. The birth of my son, Afiya!

---

## AFIYA:
Your son will be glad to see you alive one day.

---

## TAROON:
He’ll think me a coward. Too scared to show my face in the light of day.

---

## AFIYA:
Please, Taroon, for me. Raise your son without the word “coward.” Or “hero,” now that I think of it.

---

## AFIYA:
He has a full head of hair, your son.

---

## TAROON:
Really?

---

## AFIYA:
You’ll have to get a spray bottle, like Mama had.

---

## TAROON:
Never! I will never do that to my son.

---

## AFIYA:
God, you would cry!

---

## TAROON:
Well, I was wet all day! You try being wet all day!

## AFIYA:
“Mama, no, please, no!”

---

## TAROON:
It never even worked! it only made it expand.

---

## AFIYA:
Taroon, why is the television hot?

---

## TAROON:
I don’t know.

---

## AFIYA:
Taroon.

---

## TAROON:
I don’t know! It was warm in the apartment?

---

## AFIYA:
Were you watching the television?

---

## TAROON:
This is some congratulations for the new / father.

## AFIYA:
Were you watching it?

---

## TAROON:
No.

---

## AFIYA:
Taroon, how many times do I have to tell you? If someone sees it flickering from the street—
 
## TAROON:
It wasn’t on.

---

## AFIYA:
If someone sees it, with Jawid and I both out for the day—

## TAROON:
It wasn’t on.

---

## AFIYA:
They would know someone was here!

---

## TAROON:
I’m telling you! It wasn’t on.

---

## AFIYA:
You swear on your son’s head?

---

## TAROON:
Two hours old, you want me to swear on his head? If I said I didn’t watch it, I didn’t watch it.

---

## AFIYA:
Okay. Okay.

---

## TAROON:
So who’s with her? At the hospital?

---

## AFIYA:
Jawid, her family.

---

## TAROON:
Come on, show me a picture.

---

## AFIYA:
Bibi’s aunt was taking them. She said she’d send them to me.

---

## TAROON:
You didn’t even take a picture?

---

## AFIYA:
My phone ran out of battery. Two weeks early, your wife surprised us, Taroon.

---

## TAROON:
Two weeks early, but he’s not too small?

---

## AFIYA:
No, he’s not too small. I asked the doctor five times. He’s perfectly healthy.

---

A beautiful, hairy baby boy.

---

Congratulations.

---

## TAROON:
Where did these come from?

---

## AFIYA:
I’ve had them since your wife entered her eighth month.

---

## TAROON:
Here? That’s impossible.

---

## AFIYA:
Why, because you’ve pilfered every drawer?

---

## TAROON:
Mm. Have.

---

## AFIYA:
I’m not hungry.

---

## TAROON:
[With His Mouth full]
Have! I can’t celebrate alone.

---

---

## TAROON:
Four months. Four months, I haven’t seen her. I’m starting to think I dreamed her up.

---

Is she really as good looking as I think she is?

---

What do you think? This is how Bibi likes it.

---

## AFIYA:
It’s good, Taroon.

---

Taroon, you can’t go see them tonight, It’s too dangerous. I’m sorry.

---

I’m sorry. It’s not what I wanted— You know that— but it’s too dangerous.

---

## TAROON:
We have the plan, Afiya. Wait until dark, wear a chadaree.

---

Go to the hospital once everyone has left.

---

## AFIYA:
You can’t.

---

## TAROON:
And that’s what we’re doing. Waiting until dark, I’ll wear a chadaree—

---

## AFIYA:
Your son came two weeks early. We aren’t ready.

---

## TAROON:
I really thought you might not do this.

---

## AFIYA:
Taroon, going at night, dressed as a woman. It’s not so simple.

## TAROON:
It is. It is simple.

---

## AFIYA:
It isn’t! I don’t know the best way to get there, without getting stopped.

---

The best person to accompany you. Who we might trust as a lookout.

---

What entrance to use, of the hospital, It takes time.

---

## TAROON:
You’re inventing problems, Afiya.

---

## AFIYA:
Four months, you haven’t set foot outside this apartment.

---

## TAROON:
And when I do, all anyone will see is a woman walking into a hospital.

---

## AFIYA:
And if you’re stopped?

---

## TAROON:
I won’t be.

---

## AFIYA:
How can you say that?

---

## TAROON:
I won’t be.

---

## AFIYA:
Taroon your name was on a list!

---

Everyone who collaborated with the Americans. Do I have to go find it?

---

## TAROON:
I don’t think you understand. My son was just born.

---

## AFIYA:
Exactly. Your son was just born. We can’t take any chances.

---

## TAROON:
I’m sorry, Afiya, I have to be there.

---

## AFIYA:
No. You are not setting foot outside this apartment.

---

## TAROON:
Jawid said he would drive me.

---

## AFIYA:
I spoke to him at the hospital. He will not drive you. Not tonight.

---

## TAROON:
You spoke to Jawid?

---

## AFIYA:
For you to go tonight, Taroon. It would be madness. We aren’t ready.

---

## TAROON:
Without speaking to me, asking me. Just like that, your husband won’t drive me?

---

## AFIYA:
I’m telling you, it’s too dangerous!

## TAROON:
This is my son, Afiya!

---

## AFIYA:
So you had a son, and you can’t see him yet. It has happened before, it will happen again.

---

---

[Door slams]

---

---

## AFIYA:
Are you crazy? You can’t go around slamming doors!

---

---

Taroon, I didn’t mean to upset you

---

I promise, I’ll make sure you see him soon

---

It’s your son, of course you should see him.

---

Taroon?

---

## TAROON:
Thank you, Afiya,

## AFIYA:
For...?

---

## TAROON:
For everything you’ve done.

---

## AFIYA:
Taroon.

## TAROON:
You’ve fed me, you’ve put up with me.

---

## AFIYA:
What, now you’re playing houseguest?

---

## TAROON:
I know that everything you’ve done. It’s been to keep me safe.

---

## AFIYA:
That’s all I want, Taroon. To keep you safe.

---

## TAROON:
But I am going to the hospital tonight.

---

## AFIYA:
How?

## TAROON:
I’ll walk.

---

## AFIYA:
It’s all the way across the city! Are you crazy?

---

## TAROON:
I spent two years in Helmand, Afiya. Carrying a gun, coming under fire.

---

I think I can navigate the streets of Kabul For thirty minutes, at night, under a chadaree.

---

## AFIYA:
Taroon, this isn’t about your ability. This isn’t even about you! You have a child now!

---

## TAROON:
Afiya, you and your husband? You don’t decide if I see my son and my wife.

---

## AFIYA:
That’s right. You do, Taroon. You decide. That door isn’t locked from the outside.

---

But remember, Now you have a son, And that son has a father to lose.

---

---

## TAROON:
Well, what am I supposed to do? Sit here, while my child passes from hand to hand?

---

While my wife imagines how this all should have gone? That I should have been there?

---

## AFIYA:
Yes.

---

## AFIYA:
In a few short days, Taroon, You will see them. You’ll meet your son, hold your wife.

---

You’ll be a family, Taroon. Your family. I promise.

---

---

## TAROON:
This is not how it’s supposed to go.

---

This is not how any of this is supposed to go.

---

## AFIYA:
Let me make you tea.

## TAROON:
No.

---

## AFIYA:
I’ll make you tea.

## TAROON:
I want to scream.

---

## AFIYA:
Don’t.

## TAROON:
I know I can’t.

---

But knowing I can’t, It makes me want to scream more than I’ve ever wanted to.

---

## AFIYA:
I’ll bring you tea.

---

[A phone rings in Leyla’s apartment] 

---

## TAROON:
Mama called.

---

## AFIYA:
I was going to ask.

---

## TAROON:
Calling five times in five minutes. What is wrong with her?

---

## AFIYA:
She left a message?

---

## TAROON:
After the fifth time, yeah.

---

"A baby," she said, "what a blessing." She sounded like she was smiling.

---

## AFIYA:
I’m sure she was.

---

## TAROON:
I almost picked up.

---

## AFIYA:
Taroon.

---

## TAROON:
Almost. I said almost!

---

## AFIYA:
You cannot answer the phone.

---

## TAROON:
Afiya, I know!

---

## AFIYA:
Don’t scare me like that.

---

## TAROON:
Scare you? What, I can’t talk anymore? I was just talking!

---

## TAROON:
That was an hour ago. You think she’d try again. A grandson, and she hasn’t called in an hour.

---

## AFIYA:
She knew I was at the hospital.

---

## TAROON:
Still. A grandson, and she hasn’t called in an hour.

---

---

## AFIYA:
Well? Drink.

---

## TAROON:
It’s hot.

---

## TAROON:
What do you want, it’s too hot!

---

## TAROON:
You want me to burn my tongue, so I can’t speak?

---

## AFIYA:
Fine.

---

[She dials the phone, no answer]

---

## AFIYA:
She must have gone out.

---

## TAROON:
Gone out, and she has a grandson.

---

## AFIYA:
She’ll call back.

---

## TAROON:
And now for news, what? We wait for Jawid?

---

## AFIYA:
Yes.

---

## TAROON:
That’s most of my life. Waiting for your husband.

---

---

## TAROON:
It still doesn’t work. I tried to fix it.

---

## AFIYA:
Jawid will look at it when he gets home.

---

## TAROON:
It’s been three days, Afiya. They may have sent / a message.

## AFIYA:
I understand.

---

## TAROON:
Could you imagine if they’ve sent / a message?

## AFIYA:
I’ll call someone tomorrow.

---

## TAROON:
If you don’t want to call someone, I’m sure Tariq would come by.

## AFIYA:
Enough, Taroon.

---

## TAROON:
You don’t want me to hear from them. Just say it.

---

## AFIYA:
Taroon.

---

## TAROON:
I heard Jawid last night. I heard him telling you that you should get it repaired.

---

## AFIYA:
I know the walls are thin, Taroon, but my affairs are still my own.

---

## TAROON:
Who knows, they may have already sent a message! They may be inviting me and Bibi and our son.

---

They may be inviting us to America!

---

## AFIYA:
I’ll call tomorrow.

---

---

## TAROON:
You don’t want me to go, is that it? You want me to stay?

---

## AFIYA:
Of course I want you to go. Don’t be stupid. You think I want you here?

---

## TAROON:
I can handle whatever they send, Afiya. Good, or bad, or nothing.

---

## AFIYA:
Nothing! Exactly.

---

I hate it, seeing your hope when you check for messages.

---

Watching it crack when there’s nothing. There’s always nothing.

---

## TAROON:
Until one day, there’s something.

---

## AFIYA:
We repair that box and you won’t have an invitation to America, Just a message from Jeff.

---

## TAROON:
Jeff is my friend.

---

## AFIYA:
Jeff is not your friend. Jeff got to go home to America. Jeff abandoned you.

---

## TAROON:
Jeff didn’t abandon me. Listen, Afiya.

---

America, their word is good, okay? So it takes some time, it takes some time.

---

## AFIYA:
He fills your head with dreams. I don’t like it.

---

## TAROON:
You know what Jeff and I went through together.

## AFIYA:
Yes, yes.

---

## TAROON:
You’ve seen in my folder.

## AFIYA:
Taroon.

---

## TAROON:
All the letters he had them write me. Taroon translated for us here.

---

Taroon came under fire there.

---

Taroon is a strong man— Brave man—

---

## AFIYA:
Repetitive man, I’ve heard this before, Taroon. Please, you’re making my head hurt.

---

## TAROON:
They will get me this visa, I know it. They will.

---

For me, for Bibi, for our son. Jeff promised.

---

## AFIYA:
Yes, of course. Jeff promised.

---

---

## TAROON:
Four months and suddenly this place seems so small.

---

## AFIYA:
It is small.

---

## TAROON:
No, today it’s like the walls are pressing in on me.

---

## AFIYA:
You’ll get used to it. Drink your tea.

---

Go on, it’s going to get cold.

---

## TAROON:
I don’t want it.

---

## AFIYA:
You let me make tea, and you don’t want it.

---

## TAROON:
I never want it, I don’t like tea.

## AFIYA:
Stupid.

---

## TAROON:
You drink it, then.

## AFIYA:
I don’t want it.

---

## TAROON:
You don’t like it! You just like to make it!

---

## AFIYA:
That’s true. I do like to make it and not to drink it. That’s true.

---

## TAROON:
Well that’s an interesting color combination.

---

## AFIYA:
It’s our mother’s new dress. She picked them out.

---

## TAROON:
She’s colorblind, then.

---

## AFIYA:
She is not colorblind.

---

## TAROON:
She is getting older.

## AFIYA:
You don’t become colorblind with age.

---

## TAROON:
Explain these colors to me, then.

---

## AFIYA:
She has bad taste. She’s always had bad taste. Remember the dresses she would have me wear?

---

## TAROON:
You looked nice.

---

## AFIYA:
I looked ridiculous.

---

## TAROON:
Yeah, it was bad.

---

## TAROON:
I wish she could come with me and Bibi, to America. She would make sure my son speaks English.

---

## AFIYA:
[laughing]
If you make it to America, Taroon, Americans will teach your son English.

---

## TAROON:
That’s true.

---

Well, I should thank her. When my son becomes an American, it will be because of her.

---

## AFIYA:
Thank her if you get your visa, okay?

---

## TAROON:
I will get my visa, Afiya. And then, who knows. Maybe you’ll follow! You could go back to school.

---

## AFIYA:
Yes, yes. And we’ll all break out in song about dreams coming true.

---

---

## AFIYA:
Taroon, what is this?

---

## TAROON:
I got hungry.

---

## AFIYA:
These aren’t for eating!

---

## TAROON:
Now, Afiya? This is what we’re doing now?

---

## AFIYA:
This is from your pack! What have we said? We said, don’t touch your pack!

---

## TAROON:
Oh, what does it matter? I was hungry.

---

## AFIYA:
And what if you have to run away? Now you have one less meal!

---

Two! Two less meals!

---

## TAROON:
Today I am a father. We can celebrate. We can eat everything in the pack.

---

## AFIYA:
Don’t be stupid. Now you have a baby, We need a bigger pack!

---

## TAROON:
I got nervous. I got nervous, so I ate.

---

## AFIYA:
That’s fine.

---

## TAROON:
It’s a baby, I got nervous!

---

## AFIYA:
I said, it’s fine.

---

## TAROON:
You haven’t checked my pack in a while.

---

## AFIYA:
What?

## TAROON:
My pack. You haven’t checked it in a while.

---

## AFIYA:
I checked it yesterday.

---

## TAROON:
You did?

---

## AFIYA:
Yeah.

---

## TAROON:
Huh.

---

## TAROON:
Do you have the picture yet?

## AFIYA:
Of what?

---

## TAROON:
Of what? My son!

---

## AFIYA:
Not yet.

---

## TAROON:
Of course not, it’s just my child. Why should I care what he looks like?

---

## AFIYA:
They’re busy, Taroon.

## TAROON:
Too busy to send a picture?

---

## AFIYA:
Yes, they’re taking care of your wife.

---

---

## TAROON:
I don’t know why you have to do that in front of me.

---

## AFIYA:
Because this is my house and I have nowhere else to do it.

---

## TAROON:
I can’t see my son because these men want my head, and my sister is outfitting them.

---

Making army uniforms. Army uniforms for the Taliban.

---

## AFIYA:
Please, Taroon.

---

## TAROON:
Afiya, the uniform you’re holding? It lets Taliban access official places.

---

## AFIYA:
I don’t want to talk about this.

---

## TAROON:
People think they are the army! People trust them! They see the uniform and just like that. They trust!

---

## AFIYA:
Taroon.

## TAROON:
Tell me, why should I be here, Caged like an animal? Away from my son and my wife,

---

While they run free, destroying our country? Army uniforms for Taliban, For what?

---

## AFIYA:
For you. To keep you safe.

---

## TAROON:
To keep me safe? Afiya, There were stacks of uniforms in this house months before I was in any sort of danger.

---

## AFIYA:
Times are hard, They’re hard for everyone. Jawid has to keep food on the table.

---

## TAROON:
He’s doing more than keeping food on the table.

---

## TAROON:
Watching your husband wipe down that screen once a week, so careful—

## AFIYA:
Taroon.

---

## TAROON:
People have died to pay for that television set. It runs on blood.

---

## AFIYA:
Well I don’t see you looking away when a soccer match is on.

---

## TAROON:
What am I supposed to do? Make excuses to leave the room, like you do?

---

## AFIYA:
Please. Try to relax.

---

## TAROON:
I know you won’t watch it. I know you don’t approve of what he does. Why should you?

---

## TAROON:
That was our father’s shop, Afiya. He’s making uniforms for the Taliban in our father’s / shop!
 
## AFIYA:
Enough!

---

---

## TAROON:
Your hands are shaking.

## AFIYA:
They’re not.

---

## TAROON:
They are.

---

## AFIYA:
Because you’re making me angry, Taroon. That’s what happens. You make me angry, my hands shake.

---

## TAROON:
You’re going to stab yourself with the needle, Your hands shaking like that.

---

## AFIYA:
If I stab anyone, make no mistake, It will be you.

---

---

## TAROON:
Is this—?

---

## AFIYA:
It’s for your wife.

---

## TAROON:
Afiya.

## AFIYA:
I’m not in the mood to give you a present. So it’s for Bibi. For her child.

---

## TAROON:
It’s very small.

---

## AFIYA:
He’s very small.

---

## TAROON:
[Concerned]
Small but—

## AFIYA:
Normal, Taroon. Don’t worry.

---

## TAROON:
I heard you talking to Leyla. About women’s...things.

## AFIYA:
Oh, god.

---

## TAROON:
That you might be...?

---

I didn’t mean to overhear. My ear wasn’t at the door.

---

## AFIYA:
I’m not pregnant. I thought I might be.

---

## TAROON:
I’m sorry.

---

## AFIYA:
No, no. Don’t be sorry. Not today. Today, I have a nephew.

---

A healthy, normal-sized nephew. With cheeks too big for his face.

## TAROON:
You will have a child, Afiya, I can feel it. My son will have a cousin.

---

## AFIYA:
God willing.

---

## TAROON:
[chewing]
Yes, god willing.

---

## AFIYA:
Don’t say God willing with your mouth full, Taroon. You’re trying to curse me?

---

## TAROON:
What did I do?

---

## AFIYA:
Crumbs everywhere, speaking God’s name—

## TAROON:
Stop, stop!

---

## AFIYA:
Never pray for me, please, If this is how you do it. The shame.

---

## TAROON:
I am not helping—

---

## AFIYA:
It’s Jawid’s. I haven’t had the time to mend it.

---

## TAROON:
You want me to mend your husband’s shirt?

---

## AFIYA:
I want you to occupy your hands, qnd occupy your mind, with something other than tormenting me.

---

---

## TAROON:
Are you checking my work? I’m better at mending than you are.

---

## AFIYA:
You work too fast.

## TAROON:
Too fast?

---

Tell me, Afiya. Are my stitches straight?

---

## AFIYA:
Depends what you mean by straight.

---

## TAROON:
It means my stitches are in a straight line.

---

## AFIYA:
They look like a machine did them. Mine are...

---

Expressive.

---

## TAROON:
You mean yours are terrible— That’s what you mean?

---

I forgot how good at this I am.

---

[Phone rings]

## AFIYA:
Don’t!

---

## TAROON:
Afiya?

## AFIYA:
I just meant— Don’t pick up the—

---

## TAROON:
I never pick up / the phone.

## AFIYA:
I’m sorry / I just got

---

## TAROON:
Afiya.

---

[Phone stops ringing]

---

## AFIYA:
Are you hungry? I haven’t even thought about dinner.

---

## TAROON:
Afiya.

## AFIYA:
And I didn’t go to the market today—

---

## TAROON:
What’s going on?

---

## AFIYA:
Nothing. Nothing is going on.

---

## TAROON:
Did something happen?

## AFIYA:
No, no.

---

## TAROON:
Something at the hospital?

## AFIYA:
No.

---

## TAROON:
Afiya, look at me.

---

## TAROON:
What happened at the hospital?

---

## AFIYA:
Taroon—

## TAROON:
What was it? Was someone there? Who was there?

---

## AFIYA:
Just her sister. The doctor. The nurses.

## TAROON:
Afiya.

---

## AFIYA:
No one bothered us.

## TAROON:
Was anyone else there?

---

## AFIYA:
I told you everything was fine, will you rest?

---

## TAROON:
Who was there?

---

## AFIYA:
There was a man.

---

## TAROON:
You recognized him?

## AFIYA:
No.

---

## TAROON:
You’d never seen him before?

## AFIYA:
No.

---

## TAROON:
A cousin of Bibi’s, maybe? Family?

---

## AFIYA:
Taroon.

---

## TAROON:
Taliban?

---

What did he do?

---

## AFIYA:
Nothing. He circled the floor a few times.

---

## TAROON:
Did he speak to you?

## AFIYA:
To me?

---

## TAROON:
To anyone?

## AFIYA:
No.

---

## TAROON:
Was he with anyone?

## AFIYA:
No.

---

## TAROON:
But?

---

## AFIYA:
The doctors looked wary of him.

---

## TAROON:
How do you mean?

---

## AFIYA:
They jumped out of his way.

---

## TAROON:
The doctors?

## AFIYA:
Yes.

---

## TAROON:
Was he armed?

---

He was armed?!

---

## AFIYA:
Jawid is there now. He brought people with him.

---

## TAROON:
Near my son?

---

## AFIYA:
And the doctors said she can leave soon. They said it was uncomplicated. Your son is healthy.

---

## TAROON:
He’s circling the floor?

## AFIYA:
This is why I didn’t want to tell you.

---

## TAROON:
I want him away from my son and my wife.

---

## AFIYA:
They are well, Taroon. Jawid will move them soon.

## TAROON:
I have to go.

---

## AFIYA:
Jawid said you can’t. But we can put bodies between them.

---

## TAROON:
Oh, is that what Jawid said?

## AFIYA:
Taroon—

---

## TAROON:
How dare you not tell me?

## AFIYA:
I’m sorry.

---

## TAROON:
How dare you decide not / to tell me? This is my son and my wife—

## AFIYA:
Lower your voice!

---

## TAROON:
I’m leaving.

---

## AFIYA:
No. Nearly everyone we know is there. Everyone protects them.

---

## TAROON:
What room is she in?

## AFIYA:
I won’t tell you.

---

## TAROON:
I’ll try each one, then.

## AFIYA:
Be reasonable, Taroon!

---

## TAROON:
Get off me.

---

## AFIYA:
You walk into that hospital, And that gun will be fired. Is that what you want?

---

Shots fired near your son and your wife? But this way—

---

Quickly in, quickly out. The bustle of friends, the joy of a child. It’s the safest they can be. You know it is.

---

## TAROON:
Where is Jawid taking her?

---

## AFIYA:
To her uncle’s, I told you. He has a house, outside the city.

---

## TAROON:
And this house is safe?

## AFIYA:
Yes.

---

## TAROON:
You’re sure?

## AFIYA:
Yes.

---

## TAROON:
How do you know?

---

## AFIYA:
Because it’s safe, Taroon, It’s safe.

---

## TAROON:
I’m leaving.

## AFIYA:
No.

---

## TAROON:
You don’t know anything. I’m leaving.

## AFIYA:
Sit down.

---

## TAROON:
I won’t! I won’t sit here and let them terrify my family!

---

Circling the hospital? I’ll break his neck.

---

## AFIYA:
You think you’re going to break his neck? You think he’s the one who will suffer?

---

## AFIYA:
My stupid brother. If you step outside that door, you murder your child.

---

You murder your wife. You murder my husband. You murder me.

---

With one step you kill every person who has helped you. Because they will know. You know they will.

---

[A knock.]

---

---

## AFIYA:
Leyla! 

---

## LEYLA:
I brought you something, For your headache.

---

## AFIYA:
Thank you! Come in!

---

## LEYLA:
Nabil finally slept, and I never see you like that, head down!

---

## AFIYA:
Oh, I’m feeling much better. As quickly as it came, it went. Please, sit!

---

## LEYLA:
Jawid’s not home?

---

## AFIYA:
No, no, I’m alone.

---

## AFIYA:
Tell me, how was her visit?

---

[Leyla sighes dramatically]

---

## AFIYA:
That good?

---

## LEYLA:
She wants me to die. She looks at me, and I can tell. She still wishes Amir married that girl from Herat.

---

## AFIYA:
What a terrible woman.

## LEYLA:
She only stands me now because of Nabil.

---

Amir would go to work and she wouldn’t look at me except for when I was feeding him.

---

I am just the feeding station for her grandson.

---

## AFIYA:
I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again. She can’t be Amir’s mother.

---

## LEYLA:
I told you, Afiya The nose! They have the same nose.

---

Sometimes I look at my husband and I shiver because I see her nose on his face. Nabil doesn’t have it, thank God.

---

Listen to me, I sound awful. I used to be nice.

---

Fine, nicer! Nicer, at least.

---

## AFIYA:
I should have come to help, Leyla. I said I would, and I didn’t. I’ve been so busy.

---

## LEYLA:
Oh please, why torture yourself? You didn’t marry her son.

---

## AFIYA:
Still. It sounds like it was worse than when she came for the wedding.

---

## LEYLA:
So much worse, and in new and interesting ways.

---

Do you know what she kept repeating? You’re going to love this, Afiya.

---

Every day, “You hug him too much,” “You sing to him too sweetly.”

---

“You shouldn’t coddle him, he needs to grow up strong.” My son is five months old.

---

What, she wants him to do push-ups? To learn to fight?

---

Honestly, sometimes I wish I’d had a girl, so she would leave me alone.

---

When Bibi has the child, she’ll see. It’s not easy.

---

What?

---

## AFIYA:
You’re going to kill me, Leyla.

## LEYLA:
What?

---

## AFIYA:
Just remember, I hadn’t even told my mother—

## LEYLA:
What is it?

---

## AFIYA:
Bibi just gave birth.

---

## LEYLA:
What?! When??

---

## AFIYA:
Today!

---

## LEYLA:
And you didn’t tell me??

---

## AFIYA:
I had to call my / mother!

## LEYLA:
And you let me ramble on and on? Have you hit your head?

---

## AFIYA:
I’m sorry. But the birth went well!

---

## LEYLA:
Thank god.

---

I can’t believe you didn’t tell me.

---

## AFIYA:
Everyone is healthy. Bibi, the child—

## LEYLA:
And?

---

## AFIYA:
Leyla.

---

## LEYLA:
Come on, just say it!

---

## AFIYA:
A boy.

---

## LEYLA:
A boy?! And you didn’t tell me?

---

## AFIYA:
I had to tell my mother!

---

## LEYLA:
Well done, Bibi! A boy. Your family must be so happy with her.

---

## AFIYA:
Weren’t you just wishing you’d had a girl, Leyla?

---

## LEYLA:
So who does he look like?

---

## LEYLA:
Come on, who?

---

## AFIYA:
He has something of each of them, I think.

---

## LEYLA:
No, someone always wins.

---

## AFIYA:
He looks like Taroon.

---

## LEYLA:
He does?

---

## AFIYA:
He really does.

---

## LEYLA:
Oh, I feel for Bibi, Afiya. I really do.

---

I can’t imagine, having to bring a child home without your husband.

---

I hope you know, Amir and I, we’re here to help. We’re always here to help.

---

## AFIYA:
I do know that. Thank you.

---

## LEYLA:
I can make extra when I cook for a while, and when I go to the store, if she needs anything—

---

Oh, we have extra diapers, clothes that Nabil’s outgrown! You know what? I can bring those over tomorrow.

---

## AFIYA:
Thank you.

## LEYLA:
A baby, It’s a lot.

---

## AFIYA:
I know.

---

---

## LEYLA:
And listen, Afiya. If you ever needed more help, maybe bringing the baby to Taroon, or—

## AFIYA:
Leyla!

---

## LEYLA:
I just wanted to extend the / offer


## AFIYA:
I don’t know where my brother is. You know that.

---

## LEYLA:
Right. Of course. I know.

---

## LEYLA:
It’s just the most natural feeling, Afiya. To want to be with your child.

---

## LEYLA:
You’ll see soon enough! Oh, come over for lunch tomorrow, before your appointment.

---

I’m making that rice you like, with the lamb. I had Amir pick up the cherries yesterday. 

---

## AFIYA:
Oh. I had to cancel it, The appointment.

---

## LEYLA:
Afiya.

---

## AFIYA:
It’s fine. I’m fine.

---

## LEYLA:
How are you / feeling?

## AFIYA:
I’m fine.

---

I bled, that’s all. It wasn’t painful.

---

## LEYLA:
I’m sorry.

---

## AFIYA:
Three weeks late. When I think about it, it’s nothing. I shouldn’t even have made the appointment.

---

Stop looking at me with those eyes, Leyla!

---

## LEYLA:
Sorry, I’m sorry.

---

## AFIYA:
If that’s how you look at me, I’m definitely not coming for lunch tomorrow.

---

## LEYLA:
Not even for sweet rice?

---

## AFIYA:
That depends. How ripe are the cherries?

---

## LEYLA:
They’re perfect.

## AFIYA:
It’s early in the season.
 
---
 
## LEYLA:
They’re perfect.

---

## AFIYA:
I’ll consider it.

---

## LEYLA:
Can I just say—

## AFIYA:
Please—

---

## LEYLA:
It will happen for you I’m certain of it.

---

## AFIYA:
I think I want to be realistic, now.

---

## LEYLA:
Stop. You’ve had a hard year, that’s all.

---

## AFIYA:
Have we had easy years, Leyla?

---

## LEYLA:
No, but I’m telling you. This year? Between Taroon, the visa, Bibi pregnant—

---

I could smack your brother, Bibi pregnant, right as they started giving him problems. Typical Taroon,

---

Putting all this stress on you.

---

## AFIYA:
It’s not so bad.

## LEYLA:
Oh, please. The doctor said it himself, didn’t he?

---

He said the stress makes it difficult to conceive. Didn’t he say that?

---

## AFIYA:
He did.

---

## LEYLA:
Oh my god. You don’t think it’s the stress. You think it’s you.

---

## AFIYA:
Leyla.

---

## LEYLA:
What, you know better than the doctor now?

---

## AFIYA:
Maybe I waited too long.

---

## LEYLA:
No, I’m sorry, I can’t even entertain this. The way you’ve looked this year, so tired. And Jawid!

---

Afiya, I’ve never seen him so exhausted.

---

## AFIYA:
We’re fine.

---

## LEYLA:
You aren’t.

---

You’re too good, the both of you. I don’t know if I could do it. A brother, his wife, their child, the worry of it all.

---

## AFIYA:
You would do the same.

---

## LEYLA:
All I can say is don’t give up yet. Let these worries pass, Afiya, and then you’ll see.

---

You’ll try again, And you’ll see.

---

## AFIYA:
Maybe you’re right.

---

## LEYLA:
Afiya, you forget, I’m always right.

---

---

## LEYLA:
But to be serious, Afiya, with the baby born, maybe it’s time Taroon start sending something.

---

## AFIYA:
Leyla! What are you saying?

---

## LEYLA:
I just thought he might be in touch—

## AFIYA:
He isn’t!

---

Wherever he is, he knows not to contact us. Leyla, you know this!

---

## LEYLA:
Amir and I, we assumed he was sending word—
 
## AFIYA:
Well, he isn’t. He isn’t. Get it through your head!

---

## AFIYA:
I’m sorry.

## LEYLA:
No, I am.

---

## AFIYA:
I don’t mean to be—

## LEYLA:
Sometimes it’s just hard. To know what I can and can’t say

---

## AFIYA:
I know.

## LEYLA:
I mean, his son was just born.

---

## AFIYA:
I know. I’m sorry.

---

---

## LEYLA:
Have I upset you, Afiya?

---

## AFIYA:
No, I told you, I overreacted.

---

## LEYLA:
These past few months, between us, things have been—

## AFIYA:
Leyla—

---

## LEYLA:
Difficult. When Amir’s mother was here, and you didn’t come visit—

---

## AFIYA:
I’m so sorry.

---

## LEYLA:
No, I’m sorry. I started thinking, how could I have been so insensitive?

---

Complaining about Nabil every waking moment, asking you to help

---

## AFIYA:
I love to help, and you’re entitled to complain!

---

## LEYLA:
But Afiya, every day there’s a headache, a phone call, some reason to dodge me in the hallway.

---

## AFIYA:
There was a phone call today, and a headache.

---

## LEYLA:
Afiya. You were the first to know I was pregnant. I knew before your mother, when you were getting married!

---

I was here when Bibi found out she was pregnant.

---

And now if I hadn’t come over, God knows when I would have learned about your nephew—

---

## AFIYA:
Tonight! I would have told you tonight!

## LEYLA:
There’s this wall between us,

---

And it turns me into the court jester, hoping I can at least keep making you laugh.

---

## AFIYA:
Oh, Leyla

## LEYLA:
Please, tell me what I’ve done. Why you never want me here anymore.

---

If I’ve been insensitive, bringing around my child—

---

## AFIYA:
No. You haven’t done anything.

---

## LEYLA:
You can tell me.

## AFIYA:
It’s me. I’ve been overwhelmed. 

---

Taking care of Bibi, making sure she has everything she needs.

---

Making sure her child will have everything it needs. And you’re right, I haven’t checked in enough on you.

---

## LEYLA:
I don’t need that I want to help. I want to know what’s happening in your life.

---

## AFIYA:
Well I can assure you, Leyla, there is nothing else that you don’t know.

---

And not even Jawid knows that I canceled my appointment. So don’t tell him.

---

## LEYLA:
I would never.

---

I would never, Afiya! When something’s really serious, I keep my mouth shut.

---

## AFIYA:
I’ve missed you, Leyla.

---

## LEYLA:
I’ve missed you, too.

---

Here, let me make myself useful.

---

## AFIYA:
No, you’ve had the child all day.

## LEYLA:
I want to.

---

---

## LEYLA:
Feels like a long time, since we’ve done this.

---

## AFIYA:
Yes.

---

## LEYLA:
How many years were we stuck here sewing?

---

## AFIYA:
I don’t even want to count.

---

## LEYLA:
Come on, we kept ourselves entertained.

---

## AFIYA:
You kept us entertained, Leyla.

---

---

## LEYLA:
I can stay until Jawid gets home. I don’t have to rush back, Nabil is sleeping.

---

## AFIYA:
Good! Stay as long as you’d like.

---

[Scratching sound, from the closet where Taroon is hiding]

---

## AFIYA:
Mice.

## LEYLA:
Mice? You’re not serious.

---

## AFIYA:
I know, it’s disgusting. Have you had any?

## LEYLA:
No, thank god.

---

## AFIYA:
Well, we’ve only seen the one, I don’t think you have to worry.

---

## LEYLA:
This building, I swear.

---

## AFIYA:
Do you mind?

---

## LEYLA:
Remember when we had those ants? What was it, two years ago?

## AFIYA:
Please, don’t remind me.

---

## LEYLA:
It was two years ago. That was the summer I’d help you clean, before everyone came over.

## AFIYA:
That’s right.

---

## LEYLA:
Your brother and Bibi, me and Amir, Jawid. You were always cleaning, but I don’t think I ever saw a single ant here.

---

## AFIYA:
Cleaning is why you never saw a single ant here, Leyla.

---

## LEYLA:
Amir loved those nights—I did, too, All together. The TV was smaller then.

---

## LEYLA:
Always those violent American movies, with your brother.

## AFIYA:
Yes.

---

## LEYLA:
Bruce Willis would be shocked, the hours he’s spent in this apartment.

---

And for a few months, remember who came with Taroon?

---

## AFIYA:
Oh, don’t start.


## LEYLA:
Jeff.

---

## AFIYA:
Please, don’t say that name in my house.

---

## LEYLA:
He was beautiful, Afiya. admit it.

---

## AFIYA:
They all looked the same to me, the Americans. A string of Jeffs.

---

[Taroon scratches again]

---

## AFIYA:
I’m so sorry, it’s disgusting. Jawid’s getting a trap.

---

## LEYLA:
One trap? Get ten! There’s never just one mouse.

---

## AFIYA:
That’s true, I’ll tell him.

---

## LEYLA:
They were like brothers, The two of them, weren’t they? Taroon and Jeff.

---

## AFIYA:
Yes, yes.

---

## LEYLA:
I hope they find each other again. That they have a way of communicating—

---

## AFIYA:
Of course.

---

## LEYLA:
Are you okay?

---

## AFIYA:
Oh, Just this headache coming back. It’s nothing.

---

## LEYLA:
You never took the medication!

---

## AFIYA:
You’re right. I didn’t.

---

## LEYLA:
Here, I’ll get you some water.

---

## AFIYA:
I’m so warm, I’m sorry.

---

## LEYLA:
I hope you’re not really coming down with something

---

## AFIYA:
Thank you.

---

## LEYLA:
Imagine getting Bibi sick, Or the baby! God forbid.

---

---

## AFIYA:
Jawid’s— He ripped it in the shop.

---

## LEYLA:
But Afiya your stitches have gotten so straight!

## AFIYA:
Oh!

---

## LEYLA:
How did you do this?

---

## AFIYA:
You know, I’ve been— Practicing

---

## LEYLA:
This new technique. You have to teach me.

---

## AFIYA:
I will Another time! When there’s less to do! I’ve really let things pile up.

---

## LEYLA:
I’m a little cold. Do you mind if I get a sweater?

---

## AFIYA:
Bedroom.

---

---

[Afiya smacks the closet door]

---

## LEYLA:
[offstage]
God, your room is always so neat.

---

## AFIYA:
Well, I don’t have a five-month-old!

---

## LEYLA:
[offstage]
I wish I could blame him!

---

## AFIYA:
You’re lucky. Being messy is part of your charm, Leyla.

---

## LEYLA:
[offstage]
Can I tell Amir you said that?

---

## LEYLA:
Where’s the one I like? Is it in—?

## AFIYA:
Behind the door.

---

## LEYLA:
I don’t even know where you keep your things anymore!

---

## AFIYA:
We’ll have to do this more often, then.

---

---

## AFIYA:
You’re putting that on backwards.

---

## LEYLA:
Oh, shoot.

---

## AFIYA:
You seem tired, Leyla. I don’t want to keep you..

---

---

## JAWID:
Leyla, how are you?

---

## LEYLA:
Me? How is the new uncle?

---

## JAWID:
Good, good. Long day.

---

## LEYLA:
You were at the hospital?

---

## JAWID:
The boy is well.

## LEYLA:
And Bibi?

---

## JAWID:
She is well. She won’t let go of him.

---

## LEYLA:
Why should she?

## JAWID:
You’re right, of course.

---

## JAWID:
I have to be rude, Leyla. If you’ll excuse me, I need to lie down. Today has felt like ten days.


## LEYLA:
I’m sure.

---

## JAWID:
Stay, of course, Leyla. You are welcome, you are always welcome.

---

## LEYLA:
Thank you. Amir isn’t home yet, Nabil is sleeping, I get to enjoy.

---

## AFIYA:
Can I get you tea?

## JAWID:
Coffee. But I will get it myself. Stay with your friend.

---

## LEYLA:
Coffee. Very American. Should we call you Joe, Jawid?

---

## JAWID:
Please don’t.

---

## LEYLA:
I remember that night, We were all here— maybe someone’s birthday, and Taroon and Bibi,

---

## LEYLA:
They came in holding the Nescafé container like it was...

## AFIYA:
Gold.

---

## LEYLA:
Jawid, was that your birthday? With the Nescafé?

---

## JAWID:
I don’t know. There have been so many.

---

## LEYLA:
Yes, yes the elderly man I forgot. I was just telling Afiya, I miss those nights, all together.

---

## LEYLA:
We don’t do that anymore.

## AFIYA:
No.

---

## JAWID:
No milk?

---

## AFIYA:
I forgot to go to the store, with everything.

---

---

## LEYLA:
I can see if we have some.

---

## AFIYA:
Thank you, Leyla.

---

## LEYLA:
It’s no problem. I’ll be quick.

---

## JAWID:
Are you alright? 

---

## AFIYA:
He’s trying to leave.

## JAWID:
What?

---

## AFIYA:
He got it out of me, Taliban at the hospital. Help me keep him here.

---

## AFIYA:
Bedroom. Now.

## TAROON:
Is Bibi safe?

---

## AFIYA:
Yes. Leyla is coming / right back.

## TAROON:
She’s still at the / hospital?

---

## JAWID:
Yes.

---

## AFIYA:
Leyla is coming right / back.

## TAROON:
I’m going to see her. / Now.

---

## AFIYA:
You think this is a game, / Taroon?

## TAROON:
Get off me I have to go.

---

## AFIYA:
Where? Where are you going? You don’t even know what room / she’s in.

## TAROON:
He’ll tell me.

---

## JAWID:
Taroon.

## TAROON:
You’re going to tell me.

---

## AFIYA:
He’s helping you, And you talk / to him like this?

## TAROON:
Where is my wife?

---

## JAWID:
You’ll be with them tonight.

## TAROON:
Tonight?

---

## JAWID:
Yes. I’ll explain. but if Leyla sees you—

---

## AFIYA:
Tonight?

---

## JAWID:
Has anyone been here?

---

## AFIYA:
Only Leyla.

## JAWID:
Other than Leyla?

---

## AFIYA:
Jawid, I had to tell him. He wouldn’t stop. But not that they hit her.

---

Not that they pushed his Bibi, full of life down the steps.

---

Stone steps, Jawid. Seeing her fall. It’s all I can think of.

---

## JAWID:
We are blessed she was far enough along. The child is healthy.

---

## AFIYA:
But they thought he’d left Kabul, they thought he’d left the city.

---

What else could it have been? Three months of quiet.

---

## JAWID:
Afiya.

## AFIYA:
What happened? What changed?

---

## JAWID:
I don’t know, but I think we need your brother out.

---

## AFIYA:
What? Why?

---

## JAWID:
Whoever did this, they expected him at the hospital. And when he doesn’t turn up...

---

## AFIYA:
No. He stays.

---

## JAWID:
Just to the plum field. He can stay with your aunt a few days, maybe a week, until this passes.

## AFIYA:
No. No.

---

## JAWID:
Afiya.

## AFIYA:
He’s so reckless tonight. If I’m not with him—

---

## JAWID:
Afiya these men pushed a pregnant woman down stone steps, in public, in the middle of the day

---

We can’t keep him here.

---

## AFIYA:
Stupid, he’s so stupid!

## JAWID:
Lower your voice.

---

## AFIYA:
Not to cover his face. We told him, cover your face when you translate, Taroon.

---

## JAWID:
He did not want to cower. He was tired of cowering.

---

## AFIYA:
He was prideful. He doesn’t think. He never thinks.

---

[A knock at the door.]

---

## JAWID:
Afiya, we need her out. But remember, a baby was born.

---

---

## LEYLA:
Tada!

## JAWID:
Thank you.

---

## LEYLA:
Peppermint oil! For the vermin.

---

## AFIYA:
Please, Leyla. We don’t want mice all over.

---

## LEYLA:
I’ll be quick. Just a trick of my mother’s.

---

## LEYLA:
The strangest thing just came over me. I felt Taroon would be right there. Isn’t that bizarre?

---

I must have wanted him there. To see him safe. To stop imagining...

---

Lately, my mind goes to the strangest places. Not enough sleep.

---

## JAWID:
You’re kind to worry for him.

---

## AFIYA:
The door, Leyla!

## LEYLA:
Oh!

---

## JAWID:
Thank you.

## LEYLA:
It’s nothing, nothing at all.

---

## AFIYA:
You must be exhausted, Wrangling the child all day

---

## LEYLA:
I’m never too tired to sit with friends The night their nephew was born!

---

Besides, what am I going to do, celebrate with Nabil?

[Affiya laughs]

---

Come talk to me, Jawid.

---

---

## LEYLA:
So, big day, uncle.

## JAWID:
Yes.

---

## LEYLA:
Did you get to hold him?

---

## JAWID:
I did. He’s very small.

---

## LEYLA:
A baby.

---

## JAWID:
I don’t think I’ve held one so small before. At least, not in a long time.

---

## LEYLA:
That’s right. No one got to hold my little Nabil as a newborn.

---

## JAWID:
We didn’t.

## LEYLA:
Poor thing, in the hospital for weeks. I tell Amir, these are your genes.

---

Problems with lungs, who heard such a thing in my family?

---

Remember how well I could sing, Afiya? You need full, healthy lungs for that.

---

## JAWID:
That’s right.

## LEYLA:
But he’s healthy, your nephew?

---

## JAWID:
He is.

---

## LEYLA:
What a blessing. I remember those were the first words Amir said, “Is he healthy?”

---

So will you send word to Taroon? I’m sure he’s worried sick.

---

## JAWID:
I wish we could. I really do.

---

---

## JAWID:
Do you hear that?

---

## LEYLA:
What?

---

## JAWID:
I think it might be Nabil crying.

---

## LEYLA:
I didn’t hear anything.

---

## JAWID:
Do you want to go / check on him?

## LEYLA:
No, no.

---

He’s probably just fussing. Best to leave them alone when they fuss.

---

## JAWID:
You know better than me, I suppose.

---

## LEYLA:
If I jumped for every whimper...

## JAWID:
Yes, yes.

---

## LEYLA:
You men, you really know nothing about children! Do you remember, the night we brought Nabil home?

---

Amir was panicking, so scared to pick him up Like he would shatter or something.

---

Now he won’t put him down! Five months old, I tell him, Amir, Nabil has to learn to walk!

---

He looks at me, why? Why does he have to walk? Can’t I carry him forever?

---

Becoming a father, it isn’t real. Not until he holds the child. I pray that moment comes soon, for Taroon.

---

He was so good with Nabil. With his own son, I can’t imagine.

---

## AFIYA:
You know, I think I am coming down with something. I have these chills.

---

## LEYLA:
Well it is cold in here. Here let me–

---

---

## LEYLA:
Better?

---

## JAWID:
Leyla, we couldn’t keep you from Amir, not so late.

---

## LEYLA:
I’ll tell him to come by when he’s finished! Won’t that be nice?

---

## JAWID:
...Yes.

---

## LEYLA:
Moments with friends, with family, I should say, They’re rare now, with the child.

---

## AFIYA:
Amir won’t be too tired?

---

## LEYLA:
No, just hungry! But I could make us something simple! We can have a little celebration.

---

## JAWID:
Oh, we couldn’t ask you to—

## LEYLA:
Jawid, I would love to. 

---

It’s a baby, we have to celebrate! And you know me, Afiya, I can make a dinner out of anything. Isn’t that right?

---

---

[Nabil cries from across the hall]

---

[Humming]

---

## AFIYA:
Leyla?

---

---

## LEYLA:
Well that’s my evening gone then!

---

## JAWID:
Don’t worry, tomorrow. We’ll celebrate tomorrow.

---

## LEYLA:
If you need me, I’ll be pacing the hallway like a ghost again. Oh— and congratulations, my friends.

---

A boy. What a blessing.

---

---

## JAWID:
How long will she be out there?

---

## AFIYA:
I don’t know. Sometimes it’s hours.

## JAWID:
Hours?

---

## AFIYA:
Back and forth, it’s all she can do to quiet him. Taroon can’t leave now, not till she’s back inside.

---

## JAWID:
Okay.

---

## AFIYA:
I love Leyla, but my god, the way she talks.

---

## JAWID:
Coffee?

---

## AFIYA:
We weren’t rude, were we? Too strange?

---

## JAWID:
It’s late. You can make our apologies tomorrow.

---

## AFIYA:
I said I didn’t want / coffee.

## JAWID:
For your brother. He’ll need it.

---

We have a long night ahead.

---

## AFIYA:
You’ll drive him to the plum field, then?

---

## AFIYA:
And if you’re stopped?

## JAWID:
These men know me, Afiya. No one gives me problems on the road.

---

## AFIYA:
Just the same, he’ll wear the chadaree.

---

## AFIYA:
He shouldn’t need his pack. We left enough food at my aunt’s for a week.

---

## TAROON:
So? When are we leaving? How are we...

---

## AFIYA:
Taroon.

---

## TAROON:
It’s not true, is it? I’m not seeing them in a few hours.

---

## AFIYA:
I’m trying, Taroon. We’re trying.

## TAROON:
Trying? All I see is the two of you—

---

## AFIYA:
Lower your voice!

## TAROON:
—standing there, when there was a man—

---

## AFIYA:
Shh

 
## TAROON:
—at the hospital? Is my wife safe? My son?

---

## JAWID:
Taroon, we’re sorting it out.

---

## TAROON:
Sorting it out? You’re making coffee!

---

## AFIYA:
When you don’t go to the hospital, they might come look for you here.

---

## TAROON:
Where is Bibi? Where’s my son?

---

## AFIYA:
Once Leyla’s asleep, Jawid will drive you out of the city to the plum field.

---

## TAROON:
Is that where Bibi is?

## AFIYA:
She’s still at the hospital.

---

## TAROON:
Unbelievable.

## AFIYA:
You have to lie low, Taroon!

---

## TAROON:
No! / Tonight!

## AFIYA:
For a few days—


---

## TAROON:
I am seeing them tonight, understand? You don’t decide! I decide!

---

[Afiya laughs]

---

## TAROON:
What? What is it?

## JAWID:
Please, be quiet.

---

## TAROON:
Look at me.

---

## AFIYA:
I will not look at you. I don’t know why I bother anymore.

---

And making noise, so Leyla would hear? You’re a child.

---

## TAROON:
Do you hear how she talks to me?

## JAWID:
Taroon, not now.

---

## TAROON:
And you! Was it one of your friends, threatening my wife?

---

Was it the same hand that pays you? That held the gun in the hospital pointed at my son?

---

## AFIYA:
Get out.

---

## AFIYA:
Get out, now.

---

## JAWID:
Afiya.

## AFIYA:
I mean it. Get out of my house.

---

---

## JAWID:
He’s scared.

## AFIYA:
I know.

---

---

[crying from outside]

---

## JAWID:
When she stops, I’ll take him with me. I’ll keep him safe.

---

---

## JAWID:
The baby. He’s got a lot of hair.

---

## JAWID:
Did you see it sticking straight up, after they dried him off?

---

## AFIYA:
No. I must have left already.


---

## AFIYA:
I hope, this child—

---

He’ll have a bit more sense than his father. That he’ll know how to keep his head down.

---

That there’s more than enough trouble to go around. That he shouldn’t add to it.

---

How can I teach him that? Should I whisper it in his ear when he sleeps?

---

I’m being serious.

---

## JAWID:
I know.

---

You’re sure he’ll be in Kabul, then.

---

## AFIYA:
What do you mean?

---

## JAWID:
You don’t think Taroon’s son will grow up in America.

---

## AFIYA:
Jawid, come on.

## JAWID:
I don’t know.

---

When I was holding him, Afiya In the middle of it all, at the hospital.

---

## JAWID:
For the first time, I thought This child has two lives.

## AFIYA:
Two lives?

---

## JAWID:
Think. If this visa doesn’t come the child stays here, in Kabul.

---

He speaks our language, hums our music...

---

But with the visa, Afiya, he’ll be an American. He’ll live somewhere like...Rochester.

---

## AFIYA:
Rochester? What do you know about Rochester?

---

## JAWID:
That’s where Taroon’s friend ended up, no? And that’s where this child may go, too.

---

And if he does, maybe he would still know our language, hum our music

---

But he would be completely different. Unrecognizable to us.

[Afiya makes a dismissive sound]

---

He would be, Afiya, unrecognizable, I’m sure of it.

---

## AFIYA:
He has one life, and it will be here.

---

---

## JAWID:
Just in case, to prepare him— maybe you’ll teach him English.

---

## AFIYA:
I’ve forgotten my English.

---

## JAWID:
That’s a lie.

## AFIYA:
It isn’t.

---

## JAWID:
I’ve seen you, correcting Taroon’s visa application when he isn’t looking.

---

## AFIYA:
I don’t. I’m not correcting it. I’m just improving upon it.

---

Sometimes it’s a just a choice of words— One word makes you sound educated.

---

Another, a little less so. It’s nothing, I barely looked at it.

---

He’s done a good job with it. He’s really applied himself. I can’t really find fault with it.

---

What am I saying? I barely looked at it.

---

[Leyla is still pacing]

---

## JAWID:
That soldier said you didn’t have an accent, you know.

---

## AFIYA:
What?

---

## JAWID:
When he was here, he told Taroon.

---

That when you spoke English, you didn’t have an accent. He was impressed.

---

## AFIYA:
That’s flattery. I barely spoke to him. He just said that because he knew I didn’t like him.

---

## JAWID:
Okay.

---

## AFIYA:
Don’t look at me like that.

## JAWID:
Like what?

---

## AFIYA:
Like I’m a precocious child.

---

## JAWID:
Afiya, don’t speak like that.

---

## AFIYA:
Well, it’s all amounted to nothing, hasn’t it? Everything my mother taught us.

---

She was dreaming of universities abroad. That her son and her daughter would make names for themselves.

---

And what has it brought her? A son hiding for his life,

---

and a daughter with a party trick for an American soldier to clap at.

---

## JAWID:
I didn’t mean to upset you. I was proud.

---

---

[Jawid grunts in pain]

## AFIYA:
What?

## JAWID:
Nothing.

---

## AFIYA:
What’s wrong?

## JAWID:
Nothing.

---

## AFIYA:
Jawid.

---

## JAWID:
I’m fine.

---

## AFIYA:
What did they do?

## JAWID:
Nothing.

---

## AFIYA:
Show me your back.

## JAWID:
I’m fine.

---

## AFIYA:
Show it to me.

## JAWID:
No.

---

## AFIYA:
Show me your—

## JAWID:
Lower your voice! You want him to hear?

---

## AFIYA:
You need medical help—

## JAWID:
I stopped by Karim’s. He put on an ointment.

---

## AFIYA:
And bandages?

## JAWID:
Some.

---

## AFIYA:
But when—?

## JAWID:
When I was leaving the hospital. It was nothing.

---

## AFIYA:
I don’t understand Who did this?

---

## JAWID:
Boys. Not old enough to grow beards.

---

## AFIYA:
What did they want?

## JAWID:
Nothing.

---

## AFIYA:
What did they say?

## JAWID:
Nothing! It was nothing.

---

## AFIYA:
Did they ask about Taroon?

---

## JAWID:
You’re making this more than it is.

---

## AFIYA:
They asked about Taroon.

## JAWID:
You weren’t there

---

## AFIYA:
Did they know who you were?

---

## JAWID:
They were boys It was nothing

---

## AFIYA:
Did they know you work for Taliban?

## JAWID:
Afiya

---

## AFIYA:
Did you tell them?

---

## JAWID:
Taroon is going / to hear you

## AFIYA:
[Quieter]
Did you tell them you worked for them?

---

## JAWID:
Listen to me. When the men I work for. When they find out what these children did to me-

---

## AFIYA:
Did you tell them you work for Taliban? Yes or no? Did you tell them?

---

## JAWID:
They didn’t care They were children. You think they listen to reason? They don’t listen to anyone!

---

---

## AFIYA:
Did you call? Did you call the men you work for?

---

## JAWID:
Of course I called, what do you think?

---

## AFIYA:
What did they say?

---

## JAWID:
They’re busy.

---

What, they can’t pick up every phone call.

---

## AFIYA:
Did you leave a message?

---

## JAWID:
Enough / Afiya.

## AFIYA:
Did you leave a message?

---

## JAWID:
To say what? To say, these children are in the city. They pushed her, they bothered me.

---

## AFIYA:
Of course! Of course to say that!

---

## JAWID:
I’ll call them back

---

## AFIYA:
Jawid, why wouldn’t you leave a message? You have an understanding, call them back.

---

You call them now and you leave a message.

---

Jawid.

---

## JAWID:
The line was dead

## AFIYA:
What?

---

## JAWID:
The line was dead.

---

---

## AFIYA:
Did you go past their building?

---

## JAWID:
The lights were off.

## AFIYA:
Jawid.

---

## JAWID:
It’s late.

## AFIYA:
Did you knock?

---

## JAWID:
Did I knock? I’m not a dinner guest.

---

## AFIYA:
Go down there now. You go down there and tell them what’s happened.

---

## JAWID:
There were people outside the building.

## AFIYA:
Who?

---

## JAWID:
I didn’t recognize them.

## AFIYA:
So?

---

## JAWID:
So I didn’t recognize them. They didn’t look like people to walk up to if I didn’t recognize them, okay?

---

## AFIYA:
And the other number?

## JAWID:
Afiya.

---

## AFIYA:
You have two numbers, you tried the other number?

## JAWID:
Afiya.

---

## AFIYA:
Are both lines dead?

---

## AFIYA:
Oh my god.

## JAWID:
Afiya.

---

## AFIYA:
It’s happening

## JAWID:
Stop

---

## AFIYA:
They’re here for Taroon. It’s happening

---

## JAWID:
You aren’t listening This will pass

---

## AFIYA:
He has to go.

---

Tonight. He has to leave the country tonight.

---

## JAWID:
You’re inventing stories.

---

## AFIYA:
First Bibi, now this—

## JAWID:
You’re inventing stories in your head.

---

## AFIYA:
Taroon goes in that truck, he leaves the country tonight. We have to text Mohammad. Your phone.

---

## JAWID:
Afiya, listen to me. I will drive Taroon to the plum field. When I’ve resolved this, he comes back here.

---

## AFIYA:
Give me your phone.

## JAWID:
It’s a misunderstanding. When the men I work for—

---

## AFIYA:
Jawid, we don’t have time. We have to contact Mohammad. He has to ready the truck.

---

## JAWID:
Men die on this journey, Afiya!

---

You don’t put your brother in the bottom of a truck for nothing! Because this was nothing. It was nothing!

---

## AFIYA:
Jawid you look me in the eye and you swear to me,

---

You swear on my head that if my brother stays in the country, he’s not dead by the end of the night.

---

## JAWID:
Afiya.

## AFIYA:
On my head, swear it. Swear Taroon survives this night.

---

---

## AFIYA:
Mohammad said he needed two days’ notice, but I know he’s done it before. We’ll pay extra.

---

## JAWID:
He might not agree

## AFIYA:
He has to.

---

## JAWID:
And Bibi?

## AFIYA:
She’ll have to follow, when she can, With the child.

---

A newborn won’t survive the journey.

---

## JAWID:
She’s stopped. Listen.

---

I could take him to the plum field now. No one would see him. I could take him.

---

You’re sure? Taroon, out of Afghanistan?

---

## AFIYA:
I’m sure. Text Mohammad.

---

---

## AFIYA:
Once we hear from him, we can move.

---

---

## AFIYA:
Have you eaten?

---

## JAWID:
No.

---

## AFIYA:
I didn’t have time to make— There’s the rice and meat? From yesterday?

## JAWID:
I’m fine.

---

## AFIYA:
You should eat. It might be a long night. I’ll warm it.

---

## JAWID:
No, no. I’ll have it cold.

---

## AFIYA:
You’re sure?

## JAWID:
Cold is fine. I don’t have much of an appetite.

---

---

## JAWID:
You’re not eating?

## AFIYA:
No.

---

## JAWID:
Do you want some of mine?

## AFIYA:
No, no.

---

## JAWID:
What have you eaten today?

## AFIYA:
Some bread.

---

## JAWID:
You must be hungry.

## AFIYA:
I’m not.

---

## JAWID:
But Afiya, You need to eat. It’s very important for you to eat.

---

## AFIYA:
I’m sorry.

## JAWID:
No, that’s / okay

---

## AFIYA:
I didn’t mean / to

## JAWID:
That’s okay.

---

## JAWID:
It’s important that you keep your strength up, that’s all.

---

## AFIYA:
Jawid, I bled.

---

## JAWID:
Oh.

---

## AFIYA:
I’m sorry.

---

## JAWID:
You should rest.

## AFIYA:
No, no.

---

## JAWID:
I can handle Taroon. You should lie down.

---

## AFIYA:
It was a few days ago, Jawid.

---

## JAWID:
Oh.

---

## AFIYA:
So I’m fine.

---

## AFIYA:
Finish your food. When he answers, we’ll have to move quickly.

---

---

## AFIYA:
I’m sorry, I should have told you sooner.

---

## JAWID:
We have the money, Afiya. You can go to anyone, any clinic.

---

## AFIYA:
Here. I didn’t mean to give you all rice. I’ll add more meat.

---

## JAWID:
Taroon picks out the meat and eats it. I saw him at it yesterday.

---

## AFIYA:
Manners. He doesn’t have manners.

---

## JAWID:
He’s restless. He’s stuck here.

---

## AFIYA:
I’m stuck here. You don’t see me ruining everyone’s food.

---

[The sound of a text message.]

---

## JAWID:
Mohammad can take him tonight. He’s getting the truck ready. I have to pay him. Help me.
 

---

---

## JAWID:
Afiya When I’m gone, be careful. Close the window, lock it.

---

Don’t answer the phone or make any calls. Not even to Leyla, or your mother. Keep Taroon hidden.

---

We can’t take any chances. And don’t answer the door. Lock the door.

---

## AFIYA:
You should go. Be safe.

---

[Sounds of cars, volume slowly increases, before fading away]

---

---

## TAROON:
Where’s Jawid?

---

## AFIYA:
He’s going to pay Mohammad.

## TAROON:
Pay Mohammad?

---

## AFIYA:
He’s going to take you in his truck. You’re leaving Afghanistan tonight.

---

## TAROON:
What? Why?

---

## AFIYA:
This night has become too dangerous, Taroon. We can’t keep you safe.

---

## TAROON:
But we said— The plum field—

---

## AFIYA:
They’re looking for you, asking around.

---

## TAROON:
Asking around? They’re always asking / around.

## AFIYA:
It’s different tonight. Men no one has seen before, from outside the city.

---

They’re hunting you, Taroon.

---

## TAROON:
Bibi, they didn’t hurt Bibi?

## AFIYA:
No.

---

## TAROON:
You swear?

## AFIYA:
I swear.

---

## TAROON:
And my son?
 
## AFIYA:
Safe. I swear on his own head. They’ll follow you.

---

## TAROON:
No. Afiya, I can’t leave without them.

---

## AFIYA:
He’s an infant, Taroon. He won’t survive the journey. They’ll follow as soon as they can.

---

## TAROON:
When?

---

## AFIYA:
Months?

---

## TAROON:
But why should I leave? Bibi and the child, they can come here Jawid can keep us, until she can travel!

---

## AFIYA:
They can’t come here.

---

## TAROON:
Do you know how dangerous it will be, for Bibi to make that journey alone? With a child?

---

Afiya, I have to stay here Jawid will protect us.

---

## AFIYA:
He’s a tailor, Taroon

---

## TAROON:
He works for Taliban! What, is he afraid to keep us here? Is that it? He’s afraid?

---

## AFIYA:
They beat him, outside the hospital.

---

You have to go.

---

## TAROON:
And you’re sure they can’t come with me?

---

## AFIYA:
A newborn, Taroon? In the bottom of a truck?

---

He’ll cry, he’ll get sick. Besides, Bibi isn’t strong enough.

---

## TAROON:
Strong enough?

---

## AFIYA:
She just gave birth, Taroon. She needs time.

---

## TAROON:
And until you can send her, She’s safe?

## AFIYA:
She’s safe.

---

## TAROON:
So I’ll meet her—

## AFIYA:
In Europe.

---

## TAROON:
When?

---

## AFIYA:
I don’t know.

---

I promise, Taroon We’re keeping her safe. As safe as we can.

---

## TAROON:
You would tell me? If you thought there was another way?

---

Can I— Can I help with anything?

---

## AFIYA:
No.

---

## TAROON:
The pack is—

## AFIYA:
Ready.

---

## TAROON:
And everything in the kitchen—

## AFIYA:
Packed. Everything is ready.

---

## TAROON:
So I go in this truck and it takes me to—

## AFIYA:
Tehran. Mohammad drives you to Tehran.

---

## TAROON:
Okay, and then from Iran to Turkey.

---

And from Turkey to Greece?

---

## AFIYA:
No, Mohammad’s friend goes by land. He says it’s safer.

---

## TAROON:
By land? So What comes after Turkey?

---

Why did I learn the periodic table when I don’t know what comes after Turkey?

---

## AFIYA:
Bulgaria.

## TAROON:
Don’t say Bulgaria, like it’s so obvious.

---

## AFIYA:
I looked it up.

## TAROON:
And then to...Germany?

---

## AFIYA:
God willing.

---

## TAROON:
Germany.

---

Germany. Someone will speak English, in Germany?

---

## AFIYA:
I think so.

## TAROON:
And for work?

---

## AFIYA:
There are other Afghans there, you’ll figure it out.

---

## TAROON:
And money?

## AFIYA:
We’ll send you some.

---

## TAROON:
I’ll need a bank account.
 
## AFIYA:
You’ll open one.

---

## TAROON:
They’ll let me?

## AFIYA:
I think so.

---

## TAROON:
And where will we live?

## AFIYA:
The other Afghans there. They’ll help you.

---

## TAROON:
We don’t know them.

## AFIYA:
They’ll help you.

---

## TAROON:
And this is if I even make it to Germany?

## AFIYA:
Taroon.

---

## TAROON:
Why didn’t you repair this? Imagine if my visa, if the Americans have sent it.

---

No. I can’t leave! I won’t leave without it!

---

## AFIYA:
Taroon, You will leave without your visa or you will stay without your head.

---

## TAROON:
And what if it comes, after I leave? And I can’t find a computer?

---

## AFIYA:
I’ll call.

## TAROON:
You promise?

---

## AFIYA:
I promise.

---

## TAROON:
You swear on—

## AFIYA:
My head, your head, Jawid’s, your son’s.

---

---

## TAROON:
Bibi …
She wanted our children to be engineers in Afghanistan.

---

## AFIYA:
What?

---

## TAROON:
Bibi, she wanted our children to be engineers in Afghanistan.

---

Engineering, that’s what she wanted to study. She wanted to be an engineer, before they pulled her out of school.

---

## AFIYA:
She never told me.

---

## TAROON:
Someone needs to fix the roads, she said. The bridges.

---

And I would say, Bibi, we’re not having children to put them to work. And she’d give me that look:

---

Why not? Why not put children to work?

---

Well, when we get to America Bibi— She can be the engineer.

---

Though they probably need less help with their roads. The roads are better in America, aren’t they?

---

Do you have to stand there? It’s making me nervous.

---

## AFIYA:
I want to know when Mohammad gets here, Taroon. That’s all.

---

## TAROON:
Seriously, Afiya. Can you please come sit down?

---

---

## AFIYA:
What are you doing?

## TAROON:
Making coffee.

---

## AFIYA:
Get away from the window.

## TAROON:
The curtain.

---

## AFIYA:
It’s dark out. If anyone is watching the building

---

## TAROON:
You think they’re counting bodies behind curtains?

## AFIYA:
We can’t take any chances. We can’t take any chances.

---

## TAROON:
I’m sorry. I didn’t know I couldn’t make coffee.

---

## AFIYA:
You need coffee. I’ll make it for you, okay? You need coffee?

---

## TAROON:
No, no.

---

## TAROON:
Afiya, How do they even know I’m in Kabul?

## AFIYA:
I don’t know.

---

## TAROON:
How do they know I didn’t leave?

## AFIYA:
I don’t know.

---

## TAROON:
We were so careful. Did someone tell them? Did someone see me?

---

## AFIYA:
I don’t know.

---

[Sound of car driving by]

---

## TAROON:
Is it?

## AFIYA:
No. He’s across the city it will take longer

---

## TAROON:
Then why are you standing there?

## AFIYA:
To be ready, Taroon.

---

[Loud typing on the laptop]

---

## AFIYA:
That’s making me crazy.

## TAROON:
If we’re waiting here

---

## AFIYA:
It’s not going to work.

## TAROON:
You don’t know that.

---

[A loud knock at the door]

---

[A second loud knock]

---

## LEYLA:
It’s me.
Come on, I can see the light’s on.

---

## AFIYA:
[Startled]
Leyla!

## LEYLA:
They took Nabil.

---

## AFIYA:
What?

## LEYLA:
They took Nabil. They have my baby. Where’s your brother?

---

## AFIYA:
What?

## LEYLA:
Where’s Taroon?

---

## AFIYA:
Leyla, I—

## LEYLA:
All night they’ve had Amir.

---

With a gun to his head in the shop. All night they’ve had my husband.

## AFIYA:
But—

---

## LEYLA:
They want your brother, Afiya. And I tried everything. I looked I looked everywhere and I told them,

---

I don’t know where Taroon is. And now they took my baby. And now they took my baby from me. My Nabil.

---

## AFIYA:
Leyla, I don’t understand—

## LEYLA:
Afiya, They want Taroon! 

---

They want your brother! If you tell me now, I can get my baby back.

---

## AFIYA:
Oh my / God
 
## LEYLA:
Tell me now, Afiya Where is he? Where’s Taroon?

---

## AFIYA:
I—

## LEYLA:
Tell me where he is.

---

## AFIYA:
I don’t know.

---

## LEYLA:
You do. You do. I have eyes! Those stitches? That’s Taroon, I know it’s Taroon. I know he’s been here.

---

## AFIYA:
He hasn’t.

## LEYLA:
And I looked! The closet, the bedroom! I tried.

---

If he’s not here now, tell me where he is.

---

## AFIYA:
Leyla.

## LEYLA:
Where is he?

---

## AFIYA:
I don’t know.

## LEYLA:
You’re lying. Afiya, tell me!

---

## AFIYA:
I don’t know.

## LEYLA:
They have my baby.

---

## AFIYA:
I’m sorry, I can’t help you.

---

## LEYLA:
You listen, my son hasn’t even lived a full year. Tell me, why should he have to pay?

---

Why should he have to pay for your brother’s choices?

---

## AFIYA:
He shouldn’t. He shouldn’t.

## LEYLA:
He’s done nothing.

---

## AFIYA:
I know.

## LEYLA:
So where is Taroon?

---

## AFIYA:
I can’t.

## LEYLA:
How can you say that? He’s a baby.

---

## LEYLA:
Tell me where.

## AFIYA:
I can’t.

---

## LEYLA:
Afiya, tell me! Please, tell me!

---

## AFIYA:
On the plum field. My aunt’s cabin! Where we used to go My aunt’s cabin. That’s where he is.

---

## AFIYA:
That’s where he is.

---

## LEYLA:
I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I—

---

---

## TAROON:
Afiya, I—

## AFIYA:
No.

---

## TAROON:
What was—

## AFIYA:
No.

---

## TAROON:
Are you / hurt?

## AFIYA:
Stay. Stay under the bed.

---

[the phone rings] 

---

## AFIYA:
That’s probably Mama.

---

## TAROON:
Afiya, I—

## AFIYA:
Now.

---

[phone stops ringing]

---

---

[phone rings again]

---

---

## AFIYA:
Mohammad is here?

## JAWID:
No.

---

## JAWID:
But Afiya. The boy is downstairs.

## AFIYA:
The boy?

---

## JAWID:
Taroon’s son. I brought him with me.

---

## AFIYA:
Where?

## JAWID:
I left him, with Salima.

---

## AFIYA:
But why wouldn’t Bibi—?
 
## JAWID:
She...

---

She hasn’t woken up.

---

## AFIYA:
She hasn’t woken up? Should we wait?

---

## JAWID:
They don’t think she will.

---

They hit her too hard. She lost too much blood.

---

## AFIYA:
Bibi

---

Taroon won’t leave now.

---

## JAWID:
We don’t tell him. We tell him Bibi will still follow, when she can.

---

## AFIYA:
We can’t.

## JAWID:
We have to. Otherwise, he won’t go. 

---

I’ll go tell him.

---

## AFIYA:
Wait— Jawid—
 
## JAWID:
What?

---

## AFIYA:
Leyla. She has to go with Taroon.
 
## JAWID:
What?

---

## AFIYA:
She has to go with Taroon.

## JAWID:
Leyla? What do you mean?

---

## AFIYA:
They sent her, Jawid. She was asking for Taroon.

---

## JAWID:
Who was here?

---

## AFIYA:
Only Leyla I’m fine. I’m fine! But I lied to her—

## JAWID:
Coming into this house. You alone.

---

## AFIYA:
I said Taroon was at the plum field. She lied to them. She lied! She needs our help.

---

## JAWID:
The moment that truck is downstairs, I want your brother out.

---

What are you doing?

---

## AFIYA:
How much did it cost? To get him out of the country so quickly. How much?

---

## JAWID:
Double Afiya, she is not going with him.

---

## AFIYA:
Double, okay. Then for Leyla.

## JAWID:
Afiya.

---

## AFIYA:
And Nabil...

## JAWID:
And Nabil?

---

## AFIYA:
We’ll have just enough!

## JAWID:
We’ll have nothing left!

---

## JAWID:
Be reasonable, Afiya. At the first sign of danger we don’t smuggle someone out of the country!

---

She can go outside the city, hide with family I’ll help.

---

## AFIYA:
They’ll find her.

## JAWID:
You don’t know that.

---

## AFIYA:
Open your eyes, Jawid The way this day has gone, she won’t survive the night.

---

## JAWID:
We’ll try to hide her.
 
## AFIYA:
No. She leaves the country, tonight, I’m going to tell her.

---

## JAWID:
Tell me, what do you envision, Afiya? Sending Leyla with Taroon, who just betrayed him.

## AFIYA:
Yes.

---

## JAWID:
With her child, in the back of a truck?

## AFIYA:
Yes.

---

## JAWID:
A child who will scream the entire journey, endangering your brother?

---

## AFIYA:
They’ll drug Nabil. They’ll have to-

## JAWID:
And if Leyla won’t go?

---

## AFIYA:
She will. She will.

---

## JAWID:
It’s too dangerous. Too reckless.

## AFIYA:
We have no time.

---

## JAWID:
This is reckless like Taroon. No regard for any plan. For anything we’ve agreed to or worked for.

---

## AFIYA:
You listen to me. If we don’t use this money for Leyla, I will never touch it again. Not for a home, not to have a child.

---

## JAWID:
Forget the child, Afiya I’m thinking of you! What happens if they come after you? What then?

---

Then we have nothing left. No truck, no way out, nothing!

---

## AFIYA:
You’ve done this for me?

## JAWID:
Yes.

---

## AFIYA:
All of it? All of this?

## JAWID:
Yes, to protect you

---

## AFIYA:
Then listen to me. For me. To protect me, Jawid.

---

We take everything we have. We sell what we have to sell, and we put them in that truck, understand?

---

I will not have blood on my hands. We end this night clean.

---

## AFIYA:
I’ll go tell her.

---

## AFIYA:
Make sure he’ll go.

---

---

[Jawid pounds on the bedroom door]

---

## JAWID:
You will meet your son tomorrow.

## TAROON:
Tomorrow?

---

## JAWID:
They’ve already left. They’re halfway to Farah. Bibi and the boy.

---

## TAROON:
But— I thought they were following me? Afiya, she said—

---

## JAWID:
This was safer, Taroon. She was strong enough, I saw the opportunity and I took it.

---

## TAROON:
Who is she with?

## JAWID:
A friend of mine.

---

## TAROON:
So I’ll see them both tomorrow?

---

## JAWID:
Yes, tomorrow.

---

## JAWID:
And Leyla is going with you.

---

## TAROON:
Leyla?
 
## JAWID:
And her son.

---

## TAROON:
She was just here, threatening my sister.

---

## JAWID:
And your sister has decided, Leyla goes with you.

---

## TAROON:
If you had seen her, / Jawid—

## JAWID:
Tomorrow you will be with your wife and your child, Taroon.

---

## TAROON:
Tomorrow.

---

## JAWID:
You should look through your pack.

---

## TAROON:
I am already packed. Your wife has seen to it.

---

## JAWID:
Good.

---

## TAROON:
I wish I hadn’t eaten those bars.

---

## JAWID:
I will check for more.

---

## TAROON:
It’s no use. I’ve eaten the reserves.

---

Doesn’t it bother you? That she’s always right? Ever since I was small.

---

My mother would smack me on the back of the head. She would say,

---

"Afiya got two portions of sense. Her own, and yours."

---

## JAWID:
You’re ready?

## TAROON:
She’s a good planner, my sister.

---

---

## TAROON:
My folder, of course!

## JAWID:
That’s right.

---

## TAROON:
It would be stupid to leave this.

## JAWID:
Yes.

---

## TAROON:
If I left it here, Afiya would burn it.

---

## TAROON:
Listen, Jawid. I want to thank you.

---

I know it hasn’t been easy. To keep me here.

---

And I want you to know that your kindness, and your hospitality, It isn’t lost on me.

---

## JAWID:
Okay.

---

## TAROON:
Okay.

---

You’re a man of few words, Jawid. I remember you, when we were younger. Never picking sides.

---

Quiet. Afiya said she liked that. She knew other people had less patience with you. But she said-

---

That’s a man who doesn’t have to be the center of attention. I guess, growing up with me...

---

I don’t know what I’m saying anymore, my brother. I can’t believe it. I’m going to meet my son tomorrow.

---

## JAWID:
Put this on.

---

You’ll wear a chadaree over it.

---

---

## TAROON:
Are you gloating?

---

## JAWID:
Why should I gloat?

---

## TAROON:
After all the trouble I have given you for making these uniforms.

---

## JAWID:
You weren’t wrong.

---

## TAROON:
I called you a coward.

---

Now I am a man dressed up as a soldier, about to be dressed up as a woman.

---

Two layers will separate me from the world. Who is the coward now?

---

## JAWID:
You’re not a coward.

## TAROON:
All that time berating you. For keeping your family safe.

---

For keeping my sister comfortable. For keeping me hidden away.

---

You can be angry with me, Jawid. Please. Let loose an uninhibited word!

---

You’re a good man, Who has been made the guardian of a coward.

---

## JAWID:
I am not a good man.
 
## TAROON:
No modesty, please.

---

## JAWID:
I have no right to modesty, Taroon. I have sold Kabul for a television set.

---

## TAROON:
What?

---

## JAWID:
All you have told me. All the spite. All the insults. All the provocations.

---

I don’t answer because it’s all true.

---

## TAROON:
Jawid, no Listen. I didn’t mean anything by it. I’ve been lonely, and agitated.

---

## JAWID:
It’s all true. Will my wife be safe? I think so. And our children, god willing? I think so.

---

But my country?

---

I have willed myself not to think of it. I have given up my right to opinions. I experience only shame.

---

## TAROON:
I’m telling you, You shouldn’t.

---

## JAWID:
If my father could see, Taroon, what I am doing. He would die twice over.

---

If he could retrace his footsteps from the grave, he would have never moved inside my mother.

---

He would have drowned me quietly when I was born.

---

He would take back the gunshots in the city, celebrating my birth. He would tell the neighbors, hush.

---

Let no sounds escape your lips in celebration of this thing. Who is not my son.

---

Who has sold Kabul for a television set.

---

## TAROON:
For my sister! To have a child!

---

## JAWID:
And how is a child different than a television set, my brother? Vanity, all vanity, and nothing more.

---

## TAROON:
You don’t say this to Afiya.

---

## JAWID:
No.

---

## TAROON:
Thank god.

---

## JAWID:
All I can tell you, Taroon. Is that next time there is an opportunity.

---

I will not cower behind my store, talking about protection and providing,

---

Watching braver men risk everything.

---

## TAROON:
I hope that isn’t true. For my sister’s sake.

---

## JAWID:
Your sister can’t sleep for the shame.

---

---

## TAROON:
Bibi, I would sneak into her father’s house to see her. And we would talk about Afghanistan. Kabul in ten years.

---

One night, her cousin Srosh had just signed up. To interpret, for the Americans.

---

And I saw how strong she thought him, and how brave. So the next day, I signed up.

---

I signed up for the way I saw her look at her cousin. And that night, I saw Bibi and her father in the street.

---

I told them the news. He looked from me to her and he said, quickly,

---

That’s it, you’re getting married tomorrow. He was nervous about the way she was looking at me.

---

All of this to say, Jawid. I am not a pillar of strength. It is Bibi, only.

---

Bibi, who wanted the Taliban gone. Bibi, who was tired of war after war. Bibi, who wanted more than this.

---

And now, she will see me in this uniform.

---

Reduced to hiding in a truck, with the neighbor and her son. What will she think?

---

## JAWID:
She will think This is my brave husband. Who has risked everything and deserves some peace.

---

## TAROON:
God willing.

---

## JAWID:
Besides, the uniform— It is very becoming.

---

## TAROON:
You’re just saying that because you made it, eh?

---

## JAWID:
Maybe.

---

## LEYLA:
You! You piece of shit!
You piece of stinking human garbage! 

---

## LEYLA:
They took Amir with them! They said that if you weren’t hiding there at the plum field that Amir would pay.

---

You killed my husband!

---

## AFIYA:
Ley/la—

## LEYLA:
And for what? For what??

---

## JAWID:
Ley/la—

## LEYLA:
You piece of garbage. I could smell your stench across the hall.

---

Let me kill him. If Amir can’t breathe, he shouldn’t breathe.

---

You are taking air that doesn’t belong to you. It belongs to Amir!

---

## TAROON:
I don’t understand—

## LEYLA:
Fuck you! What right do you have to talk?

---

## TAROON:
I—

## LEYLA:
Garbage! First to help the Americans, of course! 

---

Taroon, strutting through the town. Amir said— He said, he likes the attention.

---

## TAROON:
Leyla—

## LEYLA:
Shut up! I want you dead! I want you dead! It should be you!

---

[Leyla cries]

## TAROON:
Amir— Instead of me?

---

I have to go.

---

## JAWID:
You are not at the plum field, Taroon. There’s nothing to be done.

---

---

## AFIYA:
The two of you are getting in that truck together, and you are leaving Kabul tonight.

---

I am going to go pack up Nabil. There is no time.

---

[Leyla continues to cry]

---

## LEYLA:
His medicine.
 
## JAWID:
What?

---

## LEYLA:
Nabil, he will need his medicine.

## JAWID:
I’ll go tell her.

---

[Leyla continues to cry]

---

## JAWID:
We can’t find it.

---

## LEYLA:
Under his bed.

## JAWID:
Okay.

---

You should come check his pack, Leyla. We don’t know what he needs.

---

[Leyla stops crying]

---

---

## AFIYA:
Taroon.

---

## TAROON:
I watched the television. Every day, I watched it.

---

## AFIYA:
I know.

---

## TAROON:
What have I done?

---

## AFIYA:
Your best. Everyone is doing their best.

---

## TAROON:
My best?

---

[Sound of a car outside]

---

## AFIYA:
That’s Mohammad. Quick. Your pack.

---

Listen to me, Taroon. You are going to take care of this boy.

---

## AFIYA:
Nabil. You are about to set out on the road with him. He will be missing his father.

---

You have to be strong for him. At this age, children don’t see men weep. Do you understand?

---

I love you.

---

## TAROON:
And Bibi? She will be there. I will see her.

## AFIYA:
Yes, yes.

---

## JAWID:
Let’s go, he’s here.

## TAROON:
I will see her?

---

## TAROON:
Afiya, will I— Will I see her?

## AFIYA:
Go! Go.

---

---

[Afiya screams and cries into the pillow]

---

## JAWID:
His son.

---

His son is downstairs.

---

Afiya.

---

## AFIYA:
Find someone else.

---

---

## AFIYA:
Find someone else.

---

## JAWID:
He needs you.

## AFIYA:
Me? He doesn’t need me.

---

## JAWID:
He does.

## AFIYA:
I killed him. I killed Amir.

---

## JAWID:
Afiya.

## AFIYA:
A man is dead. And it was me.

---

---

## AFIYA:
It’s cold tonight. Does he have a—
 
## JAWID:
Blanket. Yes. He has a blanket.

---

## JAWID:
He’s downstairs, with Salima.

---

She held him up to the window, you know, when they left.

---

## AFIYA:
Did Taroon see?

---

## JAWID:
I don’t know.

---

## AFIYA:
You can’t know, he was under the chadaree.

---

## JAWID:
I know that his son did see him. He saw his father.

---

## AFIYA:
What will we tell him?

---

## JAWID:
We have time to sort that out.

---

---

## AFIYA:
All this time I pictured, when we came home with a child. It would be to fanfare and joy.

---

A crib over there. Clothes folded in neat little piles. A basket.

---

Blankets. Bottles. A toy train, or a ball. 

---

Not even a ball.

---

---

## JAWID:
Keep your eyes closed.

## AFIYA:
What?

## JAWID:
Afiya, you keep your eyes closed.

## AFIYA:
Why?

---

## JAWID:
Aren’t you tired?

## AFIYA:
Yes.

---

## JAWID:
So rest. Keep them closed.

---

---

## AFIYA:
This isn’t— It’s not ours.

---

## JAWID:
It’s what we have, Afiya. Don’t you see?

---

This child isn’t just your brother’s child. He has his father’s eyes.

---

His mother’s nose Your shoulder to cry on. My arms to be carried in Salima’s warmth.

---

The crib that Amir built. The clothes that Leyla picked.

---

And something new that we all need. Something new and untouched.

---

---

## JAWID:
Should we go get him?
