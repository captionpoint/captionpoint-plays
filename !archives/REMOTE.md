Welcome to *REMOTE*! We're so pleased to welcome you to the theater. 

---

This afternoon's performance will be open captioned. Some moments are improvised. We have approximated the captions for those moments.

---

[Phone rings]

---

[Phone rings again]

---

## RUBEN:
Hello?

---

## ELIZABETH:
Hey Ruben, this is Elizabeth.

---

Is this a good time to chat?

---

## RUBEN:
Hey Elizabeth! Yeah, for sure.

---

I’m about to get on the train, so sorry if there’s, like, noise in the background.

---

[Train station sounds]

---

## ELIZABETH:
Oh, no worries!

---

## RUBEN:
Uh, thanks for calling me back though.

---

I just had a question about the curtain speech.

---

## ELIZABETH:
Oh, sure.

---

## RUBEN:
I was just wondering if there’s like, if BoHo has, is there something you want to happen at the top of the show?

---

I mean, we’re gonna create something in rehearsal obviously...

---

...but is there some kind of curtain speech or something that BoHo Theatre usually does at the top of the show?

---

Like thanking donors, or reminding people to turn off cell phones?

---

I know some theaters have strong feelings about that kind of stuff and I just wanted to plan for it.

---

## ELIZABETH:
Hm.

---

You know, that’s a great question.

---

Because it’s my first season as Artistic Director, I actually don’t know the answer to that off the top of my head.

---

Let me check in and see if Sana or Dalton know the answer to that.

---

## RUBEN:
Okay, cool cool.

---

Do you know if it would be prerecorded, or would it be a live curtain speech?

---

## ELIZABETH:
You know, I think we can work with whichever works best for you.

---

Whatever goes with the aesthetic you're building.

---

## RUBEN:
Awesome! Yeah, I have some ideas for how we can incorporate a curtain speech.

---

Like maybe it’s a prerecorded sound cue, instead of live... 

---

...and it’s some kind of reenactment of this phone call, or a reenactment of our emails about this.

---

Like the audience is just sitting in darkness and it’s just like audio of us pretending to have this phone call... 

---

...but actually we’re recording this separately in our own homes and then I can edit it together...

---

...and add like a train sound effect in the background or something.

---

[Sound of train doors closing]

---

## ELIZABETH:
Oh, I love that.

---

## RUBEN:
Great.

---

Let’s chat again once you find out about the curtain speech specifics.

---

## ELIZABETH:
Okay, I’ll be in touch.

---

Let me know if you need anything.

---

## RUBEN:
Great.

---

Talk soon.

---

[Phone rings]

---

[Phone rings again]

---

## RUBEN:
Hey Elizabeth!

---

## ELIZABETH:
Hey Ruben! So it turns out BoHo already has a land acknowledgement.

---

The only other information we need before preshow is a reminder to turn off cell phones and the run time of the show.

---

And look, there's plenty of room to make the runtime announcement more playful if you're not sure.

---

Off the top of my head we could say something like, “Hey, we think the show will be 70 minutes... 

---

...but we've never seen the script, so we promise it’s no more than 90 minutes!”

---

## RUBEN:
Oh yeah, that sounds right.

---

The show will be about 60 minutes long.

---

## ELIZABETH:
Okay, great.

---

## RUBEN:
And about the land acknowledgement: I think having you do that prerecorded would be best.

---

Do you have the text for that onhand?

---

## ELIZABETH:
I do.

---

I can read it now.

---

Is that okay?

---

## RUBEN:
Yeah, great.

---

## ELIZABETH:
"We acknowledge the Council of the Three Fires—comprised of the Ojibwe, Odawa, and Potawatomi Nations—

---

as well as the Miami, Ho-Chunk, Menominee, Sauk, Meskwaki, Kickapoo, and Illinois Nations... 

---

...as the traditional caretakers of the land we are currently presenting from; also known as Chicago.

---

Words have power, and we say this land acknowledgement in order to highlight the reality that Indigenous people are stripped of voting access, 

---

that Native American women are 200 times more likely to go missing from their families and communities, 

---

and that life expectancy amongst Native Americans is the lowest of any ethnic group in the United States.

---

It is important to acknowledge the land because the traditional names of the area and the Native nations who came before are not spoken aloud enough.

---

Indigenous people and Indigenous struggles are talked about in the past tense.

---

It is easier to deny Indigenous people their rights if we historicize their struggles and simply pretend they don’t exist.

---

We at BoHo seek to honor this land and the courageous people who are its past, present, and future stewards, 

---

modeling a tradition of resistance and seeking liberation.

---

"

---

## RUBEN:
Great.

---

And then I was thinking that after you read the land acknowledgement... 

---

...maybe I can talk about what this show is exactly, and what the audience can expect.

---

They’ve probably been sitting in darkness for a long time at this point and this prerecorded bit is potentially coming off as self indulgent.

---

## ELIZABETH:
Haha, yeah, we don’t want that.

---

So, tell me, what are you thinking about for the top of the show?

---

## RUBEN:
Okay, so the audience is sitting in darkness, they just heard our prerecorded meta curtain speech thing... 

---

...and then maybe a video of me reading this in my apartment comes up on the projector.

---

You know, just so the audience isn’t still sitting in darkness.

---

I don’t want anyone to fall asleep before the show has even started.

---

So now they’re looking at my face reading this, pretending like I’m just coming up with this off the top of my head... 

---

...and then I would say something about how this is a devised piece of theater.

---

It’s original.

---

Brand new.

---

We cast three performers and had them share stories about their experiences over the past two years during the pandemic.

---

We then created three short pieces inspired by these stories, which we called our “Anchors”.

---

After that, the performers went off and they each wrote a script, in secret, without collaborating with one another.

---

And then we’ll have three performances, and each performance we will do a different performer’s script.

---

So three performances, three entirely different scripts.

---

They’re all exploring the same stories, but how they explore those stories is entirely up to each individual performer.

---

And then, after I explain that, maybe the lights start to come up in the theater, and my face fades away... 

---

...and then, like, one of the performers walks onstage.

---

They, like, walk onstage and then they just like stop somewhere.

---

And now they’re just standing alone onstage.

---

And maybe they wave or smile at the audience cuz it’s awkward.

---

I don’t know.

---

And then another performer enters the stage, from the opposite side... 

---

...and the lights come up a little bit more, or change color or something.

---

And now there’s two performers onstage.

---

And this second performer looks at the first performer.

---

Like they both just acknowledge each other.

---

It’s not like, a bit, they’re just saying hi, or nodding, and they can laugh or smile if it’s awkward.

---

And then the third performer walks onstage, from like… somewhere else.

---

I don’t know, somewhere interesting, like behind the audience, or maybe it’s not somewhere interesting, whatever.

---

So now all three performers are onstage and they’re not like performing, they’re not like playing characters, they’re just themselves... 

---

...and maybe it’s kinda awkward but they take each other in and they take the audience in.

---

There’s just this moment of acknowledgement.

---

And now is when I reveal to the audience that the performers have never seen the script they are about to perform today.

---

They each wrote a script, but they have only ever read their own script.

---

The script is unmemorized and unrehearsed.

---

The only thing that has been rehearsed are the three “Anchors” we created during rehearsal.

---

Whenever the performers reach an Anchor in the script, they will put their scripts down and perform the Anchor.

---

And maybe at this point the performer who wrote today’s script will raise their hand.

---

So only that person who raised their hand has read today’s script.

---

The other two performers haven’t.

---

And now someone, maybe Lilly, our Assistant Stage Manager, or someone else... 

---

...but I’ll just say Lilly for now, enters the stage with three envelopes or binders or something and hands each performer today’s script.

---

Lilly, or whoever is doing this, just be sure each performer gets the correct script.

---

Each envelope is labeled with their name because I went ahead and highlighted their lines... 

---

...so it’s easier for them to know when they’re supposed to speak since they’ve never performed this before.

---

And then Lilly exits.

---

Thanks Lilly!

---

And… I think that’s it.

---

The audience will know when the show is over because the word “END” will be projected on the back wall.

---

But right now, we’re at the beginning.

---

The beginning of *REMOTE*.

---

And so, as soon as I stop speaking, the word “BEGIN” will be projected on the back wall... 

---

...and then the performers will open up their envelopes, or their scripts, and then they’ll begin.

---

## JOE:
Setting.

---

A sterile testing room.

---

## MARIA CLARA:
Time.

---

Summer of 2023

---

## GARDY:
Lights up on an empty, sterile testing room with three chairs, three cups of liquid, and four note cards numbered 1 through 4 that have been placed face down.

---

## MARIA CLARA:
Uh… hi.

---

## GARDY: 
Hey there!

---

## JOE: 
Hi.

---

[Silence]

---

## MARIA CLARA:
Are you here for that study thing?

---

## GARDY: 
Yeah, I am.

---

Are you?

---

## JOE: 
Yeah, I’m here for that too.

---

## MARIA CLARA:
Me too!

---

## GARDY:
Cool!

---

[Silence]

---

## JOE: 
How did y’all find your way here?

---

## GARDY:
I always keep my ear out for these sorts of science-y studies but I’m not a super big fan of the ones that ask you to take something.

---

I don’t know, I get sorta paranoid.

---

## MARIA CLARA:
I heard about that! That we would have to like…drink something?

---

But I don’t know.

---

If there was something like super bad for you, they’ll have to tell us, right?

---

## JOE:
Oh, I’m sure.

---

I was a little hesitant but it’s paid and the extra money is nice! And it’s not thaaat long of a study so that’s good.

---

I’ve seen ones where you have to dedicate like two weeks to this sort of thing and THEN come back like a few weeks after that for follow ups and stuff.

---

## GARDY:
Yeah…

---

## MARIA CLARA:
Soooo…

---

## JOE: 
Do you know if someone is supposed to come in?

---

And lead the study or…?

---

## GARDY:
Buddy, I think we know as much as you do.

---

## JOE:
Oh… cool.

---

[Silence]

---

## MARIA CLARA:
I guess I should sit down?

---

Did you see those notecards?

---

## JOE: 
Uh, yeah.

---

Do you think there’s something special about them?

---

## MARIA CLARA:
They’re numbered so I’m sure that has to mean something.

---

## JOE: 
Hm.

---

## GARDY:
Maybe it has something to do with the study?

---

There are four cards and four days?

---

## JOE: 
Ooh! That makes perfect sense! I thought maybe we would each get one but I figured the fourth person was either really late or just didn’t exist.

---

Did you wanna do the honors and flip them over?

---

## MARIA CLARA:
I don’t know if he should do thaaat! We should wait for someone to come in and tell us what we’re supposed to do.

---

## JOE: 
We’ve already been sitting here for like ten minutes.

---

## GARDY:
Maybe we should wait a little while longer?

---

I just don’t want to mess up the study.

---

They could be running behind schedule or something.

---

## JOE:
Okay! Fine! Whatever!

---

[Silence]

---

## GARDY:
Soooo…where do you all live?

---

## MARIA CLARA:
Are we allowed to talk about that?

---

I thought this was supposed to be totally anonymous.

---

## GARDY:
I’m not asking for your social security number! I was just wondering if we were from all over the world or if we’re all coming here from Chicago.

---

## MARIA CLARA:
I just don’t know if I’m comfortable sharing that.

---

## GARDY: 
That’s okay! It’s really no biggie.

---

We can just sit and wait.

---

[Silence]

---

## JOE:
Okay, it’s been like 15 minutes at this point.

---

I’m at least reading Card #1.

---

“Hello! Thank you for joining our study! And thank you for taking the first step by reading the first card! 

---

In our four-day study, we ask that you take the word that we provide you each day and associate it with a feeling or memory from The Dark Times.

---

We strongly encourage that you share your thoughts with the other two subjects.

---

BUT! We kindly ask that you have a sip from the cups prior to you beginning each talking session.

---

It is incredibly important that you look each other in the eyes before you sip.

---

Take that moment in.

---

Sip.

---

And then speak.

---

Fear.

---

”

---

## GARDY:
So it’s just word association with a splash of Mystery Juice?

---

## MARIA CLARA:
See, I told you they wouldn’t ask us to drink it if it was dangerous! What if we just gave it a shot?

---

## GARDY: 
But for who?

---

No one has come in yet?

---

Maybe we read them too quickly?

---

Wouldn’t it be weird if someone just came in halfway through whatever this weird word association game is?

---

I just feel like whoever is in charge would be pretty upset that we started without them.

---

## JOE: 
Okay so then if that happens, we just say we didn’t know what to do to pass the time.

---

They gave us the codes to the building, I’m sure that means they have some record of us checking in and being here so they HAVE to know we’re in here waiting.

---

We can just maybe brainstorm a little bit and then stop whenever we hear someone coming in.

---

I can start! Come on, everyone grab your cups like Mr. Notecard said!

---

## GARDY:
Uh how do you know it’s a Mister?

---

## JOE: 
I… well… okay please just grab your cups.

---

## MARIA CLARA:
I mean you’re right, why did you just gender that notecard?

---

## JOE:
I’m sorry I really didn’t mean to ascribe a gender to this piece of paper! Truly! But can we please hurry it up before someone comes in?

---

I’m really nervous about just blindly launching into something in front of whoever is running the study, and if we have a leg up with at least somewhat knowing what we’re talking about, I bet that would be a plus for them!

---

## GARDY:
Fine.

---

## MARIA CLARA:
Okay, I’m comin’.

---

## JOE:
Fear?

---

## MARIA CLARA:
Fear.

---

## GARDY:
Oh geez where do you even start with something like that?

---

There was so much to be afraid of back then.

---

Food selling out.

---

Not having enough toilet paper.

---

The coin shortage?!

---

What was up with that?

---

## JOE:
How about being afraid to walk too closely to someone in a park?

---

## MARIA CLARA:
Ooh or being afraid of biking behind someone that you hear coughing?

---

## GARDY:
I’m glad we’re doing this now.

---

I’m so bad at thinking up things on the spot.

---

## MARIA CLARA:
Oh same.

---

## JOE:
Okay, but how does it make you feel?

---

## GARDY: 
Huh?

---

## JOE:
How does it make you feel?

---

## GARDY: 
Uhm.

---

Afraid?

---

That’s why I said what I said?

---

## JOE: 
Okay but how did all of it actually make you feel?

---

## GARDY:
I’m sorry, are you the one leading the study or aren’t we still waiting for someone to come in?

---

## JOE: 
I’m just… trying to make conversation while we wait, buddy.

---

I don’t know.

---

[Silence.]

---

## GARDY:
It made me feel…

---

[Silence.]

---

[Upbeat techno music begins playing.]

---

[The music fades away.]

---

[We hear a news broadcast.]

---

## FEMALE NEWS ANCHOR:
… the deadly coronavirus officially hitting the U.S.

---

Here’s what we know: a Washington state resident fell ill after returning from Wuhan, China where the outbreak began…

---

[Sounds of riots and glass breaking.]

---

## FIELD REPORTER:
… can see police here are now firing tear gas into the crowd.

---

They are trying to push these folks back.

---

Earlier today, just a few blocks away, there was looting underway nearby.

---

Police seem…

---

## FEMALE NEWS REPORTER:
Hey Robin, good morning.

---

So that patient is a man in his thirties.

---

He is in the hospital here behind me.

---

Now officials are describing his condition as satisfactory, but he will remain in isolation…

---

[Police radio chatter.]

---

## MALE NEWS REPORTER:
… early morning hours.

---

Dozens of American cities up in flames, after some protests turned into riots.

---

[Sounds of shouting.]

---

## MALE NEWS REPORTER:
Often followed by looting, as a nation simmering with unrest unraveled…

---

## CITIZEN:
How long can you be peaceful when your people are dying?

---

## MALE NEWS REPORTER:
In Los Angeles, hours before a curfew was ordered, the city became a warzone.

---

## FEMALE NEWS ANCHOR:
… Seattle last Wednesday.

---

Infected, but not yet symptomatic.

---

According to officials shortly after arriving in Seattle he began feeling ill and reached out to his healthcare provider on Sunday.

---

Twenty four hours later, his diagnosis was confirmed by the CDC.

---

The man entering the country before federal health officials…     

---

[Glass breaking and screaming.]

---

[Sounds of fire and sirens.]

---

[The riot sounds turn into a low rumble.]

---

[The rumble fades away.]

---

[Silence.]

---

## GARDY:
Whoa.

---

## MARIA CLARA:
I… what was that?

---

All of that?

---

## JOE:
I have no idea.

---

But that all strangely made sense?

---

Like, I understand you both a little bit better?

---

## GARDY:
Uh sure.

---

That was really, really freaky.

---

I think I’m going to head out.

---

We’ve been here for a while and no one has shown up.

---

Maybe this was all just a dud.

---

## MARIA CLARA:
Are you coming back for Day 2?

---

## GARDY:
I… uh… I’ve gotta go.

---

## MARIA CLARA:
Are you coming back tomorrow?

---

## JOE:
I think so?

---

I don’t know what just happened but I want answers.

---

## MARIA CLARA:
Cool.

---

Me too.

---

So, we’ll meet back here tomorrow.

---

## JOE: 
Sounds good.

---

## GARDY:
Day Two!

---

## JOE:
Hey!

---

## MARIA CLARA:
Hi!

---

[Silence.]

---

## MARIA CLARA:
Do you think he’s coming?

---

## JOE:
Don’t know.

---

He seemed pretty weirded out by everything from yesterday.

---

## MARIA CLARA:
Let’s just give it a minute.

---

He still might come!

---

[Silence.]

---

## MARIA CLARA:
See! I knew you’d come back!!

---

## GARDY:
Uh… hi.

---

## JOE:
Glad to have you here.

---

I figured it might mess up the study if we all didn’t come back for the rest of it.

---

## MARIA CLARA:
Are you okay?

---

From yesterday?

---

## GARDY:
Yeah… I just.

---

The way everything came rushing back.

---

From when everything started happening.

---

It was just weird to feel it all again.

---

## MARIA CLARA:
I think that’s absolutely fair to feel.

---

## JOE:
No one checked in to debrief with me yesterday.

---

Isn’t it weird how no one really followed up?

---

## GARDY:
Sure, but I mean… someone has to be watching behind that camera up there, right?

---

## MARIA CLARA:
The WHAT?

---

## JOE:
I… don’t know how I missed that yesterday.

---

## GARDY:
I was thinking about it on the way home.

---

I figured someone must be watching from somewhere in the building.

---

So maybe they’re just watching us remotely or something.

---

## MARIA CLARA:
Weird.

---

I think that gives us permission to flip over the next card.

---

I’m sure Red Blinking Light would let us know if this isn’t what we were supposed to be doing.

---

## GARDY:
Makes sense.

---

## JOE:
Did anyone want to do the honors?

---

## GARDY:
I can, I guess.

---

“Thank you for returning for Day 2 of our study! We invite you to think over this next word and associate it with The Dark Times, once again.

---

Overwhelmed.

---

”

---

## JOE: 
That’s a bit of a loaded topic, right?

---

## MARIA CLARA:
What did you expect?

---

We signed up for a study about how we felt during the most batshit time of our lives!

---

## GARDY:
So far!

---

## MARIA CLARA:
Huh?

---

## GARDY:
Most batshit time of our lives, so far!

---

## MARIA CLARA:
Why… would you say that?

---

## GARDY:
And before we start, let’s grab those cups.

---

Overwhelmed.

---

I can start this one.

---

Do you remember where you were when you realized when shit was hitting the fan?

---

I was standing in the middle of a grocery store holding a bag of BEANS.

---

I could feel how tangible the panic was.

---

People frantically grabbing what they could off the shelves.

---

As a 9 to 5-er, getting to the stores way after they announced that first lockdown was scary.

---

## JOE:
Oh, I bet.

---

Imagine working in a literal HOSPITAL when everyone was finding out.

---

## MARIA CLARA:
Whoa.

---

## JOE: 
Yeah.

---

Seeing first hand how not even the doctors knew what was going on was strange.

---

They are the people who are supposed to know all of the answers and being right there, witnessing their confusion and cluelessness.

---

It was unsettling.

---

## GARDY:
I couldn’t imagine.

---

## JOE:
Yeah.

---

And what sucked the most?

---

Imagine trying to plan for your anniversary right around the time the world basically split open!

---

## MARIA CLARA:
I still feel like The Dark Times happened right as everyone was right in the middle of doing something.

---

Something big and important in their lives.

---

It’s like the universe knew that we were all trying to do something and said, “Uh uh.

---

Not today!”

---

## GARDY: 
What about you?

---

## MARIA CLARA:
Hm?

---

## GARDY:
Overwhelmed?

---

## MARIA CLARA:
Uh… do you all know who Sweetie Pie is?

---

## GARDY:
Oh.

---

My.

---

God.

---

## JOE:
Are you talking about that dog that went viral??

---

## MARIA CLARA:
Hypothetically.

---

Sure.

---

Yeah, I’m talking about that dog.

---

## GARDY: 
I was OBSESSED! With the cute tongue that sorta just flopped out?

---

Probably the cutest dog I have ever seen.

---

## JOE: 
My family and I are big, BIG fans of Sweetie Pie.

---

Probably one of the things that really got us through The Dark Times.

---

Bummed us out when new content stopped showing up.

---

## MARIA CLARA:
See.

---

Everyone always loves the dog but never really cares about WHO is the one posting the dog.

---

## GARDY:
Huh?

---

## MARIA CLARA:
Put yourselves in the shoes of someone trying to keep up on those apps! Seriously.

---

Close your eyes and really think about what it takes to try to build something online that you’re really working hard on, 

---

only for everyone to be focused on your dog instead of you.

---

[Cheery techno intro music]

---

## MARIA CLARA:
Hi guys! And welcome to Maria Clara’s cooking show.

---

It is me, Maria Clara! And I am so excited to have you here today.

---

Hopefully more people will join and come party with us.

---

Today we are going to be working on a recipe that I have been perfecting over the past couple of months of the lockdown, and it is PUFF PASTRY.

---

I know, you would think that it is so easy, but it took me a couple of tries to get it just right.

---

What you will need: very cold salted butter cut into cubes, very cold water, salt, and all-purpose flour.

---

## GARDY:
Where does puff pastry come from?

---

## MARIA CLARA:
Yes, so actually, oh wait, do you mean like nationally?

---

Like what country it comes from?

---

Or do you mean ingredients?

---

## JOE:
How easy is it to make puff pastry from scratch?

---

## MARIA CLARA:
You know, it’s not the easiest, but it’s also not the hardest thing in the world.

---

It’s just one of those things where you need to-

---

## GARDY:
I bet she didn’t wash her hands.

---

## MARIA CLARA:
Anyways, so let’s keep going.

---

You need flour-

---

## JOE:
What’s the ideal number of layers?

---

## MARIA CLARA:
The ideal number of layers is actually a lot.

---

## GARDY:
You don’t even have any viewers.

---

Why are you still uploading stuff?

## MARIA CLARA:
I’m going to mix all the stuff, and remember the butter has to be super cold for it to work out.

---

## JOE:
Sorry, I missed the first part. Is the butter supposed to be refrigerated or room temperature?

---

## GARDY:
Is that a dog in the background?

---

## JOE:
I don’t have any water and flour.

---

What’s a good substitute?

---

## GARDY:
Are you single?

---

## JOE:
Why are you making baking videos?

---

Show us your dog.

---

## GARDY:
Yeah, show us your dog.

---

## GARDY & JOE:
Show us your dog! Show us your dog! Show us your dog!

---

## MARIA CLARA:
You know what?

---

I can’t do this anymore.

---

For the past three years I have been working day and night on this Instagram account.

---

It started from an actual passion of mine.

---

I love cooking, baking, anything and everything to do with the kitchen.

---

When I uploaded my first picture, Instagram felt like it clicked.

---

If I’m already making all these cooking creations, I can just easily snap a picture and post it.

---

Right?

---

No, not right.

---

I need each picture to be perfectly framed.

---

My feed has to look beautiful.

---

My feed has to be aesthetic.

---

And as I continue to change for the “better,” so does Instagram.

---

No, no, no, we don’t want one picture anymore, we want a carousel.

---

Oh, and while we are at it, we also need you to start posting videos.

---

But not long videos, only 7 seconds where you highlight a process that took you 7 hours… 

---

And then the Instagram gurus rose from the dungeons of the internet to guide me.

---

“Hey, if you actually want to succeed, you better start posting more than once a week.

---

Post three times a day on your main feed and 10 times a day on your story.

---

”

---

It’s okay.

---

I can do this.

---

Create, post, create, post, create, post.

---

30 likes, 

---

200 likes, 

---

10 likes.

---

2 new followers.

---

50 new followers.

---

5 new followers.

---

NOTHING WORKS.

---

I need a break, let me just post a video of Sweetie Pie, my dog.

---

Boom. 

---

Viral.

---

## JOE:
I left Facebook because it made me the craziest out of any of them.

---

Facebook lays out comments and replies, like dialogue in a play, and I guess the writer in me couldn’t help but get overinvested.

---

But we lived in Ann Arbor, so I stayed on Twitter and Instagram to feel connected to the theater community back here.

---

When the pandemic started, social media was where I saw the theater dominoes start falling.

---

Shows halting performances.

---

Companies shuttering.

---

Productions getting canceled.

---

Which is hard on anybody, but especially hard on playwrights.

---

Productions of new plays are so rare.

---

And as I saw playwright friends devastated by losing productions, I realized that my main feeling was not empathy and regret but… jealousy?

---

Like, “Oh man, what’s wrong with me that I don’t have any productions getting canceled?

---

My career sucks!” 

---

Which -- I honor all of my feelings as valid as is emotionally healthy -- but that’s a fucked up feeling.

---

I don’t know if the issue is social media or the creative industry I work in.

---

## GARDY:
I’m so overwhelmed with the idea of being plugged in constantly.

---

I see social media as this cacophony of noise.

---

Good noise and bad, mixing in this echo chamber.

---

Some days, it sounds like a harmonious chorus, other days it’s a loud, incoherent yell.

---

I tried to keep up when shit really started hitting the fan.

---

I did the zoom readings, I stayed up to date with local and global news, I connected with friends and family as much as I could.

---

But one day, I realized that I just couldn’t keep up anymore.

---

As soon as one thing happened and everyone was talking about it, 

---

there were three more things that also just happened that caused the conversation to split off in different ways.

---

It was becoming impossible to be informed about everything.

---

I did a bit of a silent exit from social media.

---

I feel like these days, I’m more of my cat’s personal photographer more than anything, when it comes to what I post.

---

I ask myself and also anyone out there who is listening, 

---

How do we continue to show up for ourselves but also the thousands of tiny voices in the mini supercomputers in our pockets?

---

While I still learn to re-navigate the digital space, I’ll share what I’m able to share, 

---

contribute to the conversations when I’m able, 

---

and share as many photos of my cat as possible.

---

## JOE: 
I had no idea…

---

## MARIA CLARA:
Really puts things into perspective, right?

---

## GARDY: 
Yeah…

---

## MARIA CLARA:
I’m glad that everyone got to connect with her but it still makes me think, “Wow, social media sucks sometimes."

---

## GARDY:
Absolutely.

---

Honestly that’s why it’s hard for me to keep up.

---

## JOE: 
I know that things are supposed to remain anonymous but isn’t it against the rules to tell us about your dog?

---

## MARIA CLARA:
Sure, but do you ever really learn about the person behind the dog?

---

Not really.

---

They’re just here for the cute content.

---

## JOE:
I guess you got me there…but that isn’t right.

---

## MARIA CLARA:
I know that.

---

But it’s okay.

---

I think I’m ready to head out.

---

How about you all?

---

They’d probably tell us if they’d want us to stick around longer.

---

Honestly, I’m just ready to be home with my dog.

---

## GARDY:
I’m sure it’s fine if we head out now.

---

Is that okay, Blinking Red Light?

---

[Silence.]

---

## JOE:
Say no more!

---

## GARDY:
What do you think this actually is?

---

## JOE:
What do you mean?

---

## GARDY:
This study.

---

## JOE:
I’m still not sure.

---

The questions are weird but also, I feel like there have been a ton of studies like this ever since The Dark Times.

---

I don’t know what they’re searching for but I’m sure they’ll find it.

---

## GARDY: 
Maybe.

---

Hopefully.

---

## JOE:
I’ll see you tomorrow, buddy.

---

## GARDY:
See ya.

---

Day Three!

---

Day Three, Day Three!!

---

## MARIA CLARA:
I wonder what weird word is behind Door Number Threeee!

---

## GARDY:
Door Number Three?

---

## MARIA CLARA:
You know, like in the game shows?

---

## GARDY:
They aren’t doors, they’re notecards.

---

## MARIA CLARA:
I… know that.

---

## GARDY:
I know, I’m just messin’.

---

## MARIA CLARA:
Okay…

---

## GARDY:
I’m sorry.

---

This is the most I’ve been around people I don’t live with.

---

## JOE:
I thought all of that was kinda funny.

---

## GARDY:
Really?

---

## JOE:
Sure! 

---

My sense of humor has also kinda shifted since everything started happening so maybe none of us are really the best judges for what’s funny and what’s not.

---

## MARIA CLARA:
I think the weirdest things are funny now.

---

I actually got sick three times when everything started.

---

I feel like when something like that happens to you, you just have to laugh.

---

Right?

---

## GARDY:
I’m so sorry.

---

## MARIA CLARA:
No! It’s fine! It’s in the past now! 

---

## JOE:
I guess that’s kinda funny.

---

Like, what dumb luck that is.

---

## MARIA CLARA:
RIGHT?!

---

Three times! But enough about that.

---

Let’s flip over that third notecard! 

---

Oh.

---

## GARDY:
What?

---

## MARIA CLARA:
This one is pretty short.

---

## JOE:
What does it say?

---

## MARIA CLARA:
“Relief”.

---

## JOE:
That’s it?

---

## MARIA CLARA:
Yep.

---

Let’s take a sip and dive into this one, I guess.

---

Relief.

---

I can say, I was relieved when I walked into this room for the first time and it was air conditioned!

---

## JOE:
OH YEAH.

---

## GARDY: 
This summer has been HELL.

---

If I can be in a building with the air conditioned cranked on high, I’m on board.

---

## MARIA CLARA:
But seriously.

---

The amount of time I spent with family during these past few years, it was a blessing.

---

## GARDY:
Really?

---

How long did you go without seeing them?

---

## MARIA CLARA:
I actually kinda moved in with them for a bit after I finished school.

---

We went through much of the last few years together.

---

What about you?

---

I’m sure you guys saw your families a ton!

---

## GARDY:
Actually, no.

---

I went nearly a year and a half without seeing my parents in person.

---

## MARIA CLARA:
It wasn’t right for me to assume.

---

## GARDY:
No! It’s okay! Life was weird and we all had to take our own precautions and do the things that we were able to do.

---

But it’s okay.

---

The day I was finally able to hug both of my parents again, I thought I would never let go.

---

My mom had to come up to get me and my sister because I was having car problems...

---

...and the anticipation of seeing someone really important to you after not seeing them or holding them for so long was just… 

---

I don’t know how to describe it.

---

When we finally made it back to my hometown and I saw my dad, all just felt right again.

---

## MARIA CLARA:
I get that.

---

Having all of us under one roof definitely wasn’t something we took for granted.

---

I remember one night, we were having our usual Sunday night grill out and we were sitting around the table.

---

My dad looked around at all of us and really took us all in.

---

He let out this sigh and said, “How lucky we are to be sitting here, all of us together, and sharing this meal."

---

Of course, not everyone is fortunate enough to have that, so when you’re able to... 

---

...you have to hold onto those moments and not take them for granted.

---

## JOE:
Life can be such a funny thing.

---

The distance, the togetherness.

---

It can be overwhelming sometimes but when everything stops and you really take stock of what you have, 

---

it reminds you of how nice the world can be.

---

## MARIA CLARA:
Absolutely.

---

## GARDY:
What about you?

---

Relief?

---

## JOE:
Two words.

---

“Teddy Wrestling."

---

## GARDY:
What?

---

## JOE:
Teddy.

---

Wrestling.

---

[Crowd cheers]

---

## JOE:
And now, on the most adorable stage in sports entertainment, playing for the ninety-third day in a row...

---

...it’s the Stuffed Animal Smackdown, Sunday Night Awwwww, Teddy Wrestling League! 

---

The biggest teddy wrestling event of the day in which real life humans work out their frustrations on stuffed animals! 

---

For our first match, we have Maria Clara! 

---

[Reggaeton music]

---

## JOE:
And in this corner, weighing in at 8.5 ounces of fluffy fury...

---

...we have Five Grown Ass Adults Sharing One Bathroom During Lockdown!

---

[Upbeat music]

---

## JOE:
Alright you two, I want a clean fight.

---

No tables, and no chairs! 

---

Fight!

---

[Boxing bell’s “ding ding ding”]

---

## MARIA CLARA:
I want to use the bathroom!

---

## GARDY:
No, I want to use the bathroom!

---

## MARIA CLARA:
I was in line first!

---

## GARDY:
Well, I just have to pee!

---

## MARIA CLARA:
No you don’t, you always say that! 

---

And then you poop anyways!

---

## GARDY:
Oh yea, well I call this my famous bathroom line uppercut.

---

## MARIA CLARA:
You know how much I ate last night.

---

I don’t just have to pee, I have to POOP!

---

## JOE:
Hey, no ears! No ears!

---

## GARDY:
Can I just use the bathroom while you’re showering?

---

I’ll be quick!

---

## MARIA CLARA:
That’s it.

---

I’ve had it.

---

We're building an outhouse in the backyard!!!

---

## JOE:
One! Two! Three! 

---

[Ding ding ding!]

---

## JOE:
You’re out! Maria Clara is the winner!

---

## JOE:
And now, for our next match, in one corner, we have Gardy!

---

[Soft lo-fi music]

---

## JOE:
And in the other corner we have Being Cooped Up With Your Roommates For Months On End!

---

[80’s synth pop music]

---

## JOE:
Fight!

---

[Ding ding ding!]

---

[Glass breaking]

---

## MARIA CLARA:
Oops.

---

## GARDY:
What was that?

---

## MARIA CLARA:
Uh, nothing.

---

## GARDY:
Did you break something?

---

## MARIA CLARA:
Yeah, what about it?

---

## GARDY:
That was the last one in the store.

---

All the shelves are empty.

---

Now it’s out of stock!

---

## GARDY:
I always have to do all the cleaning! Why don’t you ever take out the trash?

---

## MARIA CLARA:
Because it smells bad!

---

## MARIA CLARA:
Well, you know what, I invited some people over for a party.

---

Hope you don’t mind.

---

## GARDY:
How many people?

---

## MARIA CLARA:
… Twenty two.

---

## GARDY:
Well, I hate to burst your bubble, but that’s a bad idea!

---

## JOE:
Oh, bill breaker!

---

## JOE:
One! Two! Three! 

---

[Ding ding ding!]

---

## JOE:
That’s it! We have a winner!

---

[Cheering crowd fades away]

---

## JOE:
Whoa whoa whoa! Hold it right there.

---

Make a better choice, Ducky.

---

That’s against the rules.

---

I’ll just take this….

---

## MARIA CLARA:
I just want to have people over!

---

## GARDY:
I just want to use the bathroom!

---

## MARIA CLARA:
I just want to poop.

---

## JOE:
Two fights is enough! I need to send some emails.

---

Let me introduce you to my two friends: Peace and Tranquility!

---

## JOE:
When you’re five years old, like my son Solly was at the start of the pandemic, you don’t have a lot of control over your life.

---

Every day, for months, Solly worked out his feelings of powerlessness with me via lengthy Teddy Wrestling sessions.

---

He didn’t name his teddies things like, “I Miss My Friends and My Lame Parents Won’t Let Me Watch Marvel Movies...” 

---

...but I think that’s what he was wrestling with.

---

[Heavy metal music]

---

[Crowd noise returns.]

---

## MARIA CLARA:
BOOOORING! Now it’s time for some real wrestling!

---

## JOE:
We should probably get back to the script.

---

## JOE:
Alright, that’s enough Mr. Alligator.

---

[Crowd cheers fade away]

---

## JOE:
One! Two! Three! Bed time!

---

## JOE:
He tired himself out.

---

I’ll go tuck him in.

---

## GARDY:
Okay I get it now.

---

Teddy Wrestling.

---

## MARIA CLARA:
That was… intense.

---

## JOE:
I know.

---

But here’s the thing, though it literally took everything out of me, knowing that this was something that got my kid through all of this... 

---

...I’d wrestle the hell out of those teddies any day of the week.

---

It can be so hard putting words to all of this shit going on.

---

So, if there’s any way I can help make things normal again, I’ll do it.

---

No kid should ever have to make a game of how fast you can put on PPE.

---

I just couldn’t have ever imagined that happening.

---

But here we are.

---

## GARDY:
I’ll drink to THAT.

---

I literally couldn’t have dreamed of something happening like what we’ve all gone through.

---

## MARIA CLARA:
Yeah… so there’s only one card left.

---

What do you all think it is?

---

## GARDY:
Who knows?

---

But I hope we don’t have to write some group authored paper reflecting on the past three days because I SUCK at writing.

---

## MARIA CLARA:
Oh god me too.

---

## JOE: 
Nah.

---

I bet it will be an invitation to a catered lunch or something.

---

A wrap up meeting with the whole team where they thank us for our time, yadda-yadda.

---

## GARDY:
Well, I’ll see y’all bright and early tomorrow!

---

## GARDY:
(From offstage.) Day Four!

---

## JOE: 
I’ve noticed something.

---

## MARIA CLARA:
What’s that?

---

## JOE:
Have either of you seen anyone at the front or walking around the building at all?

---

## MARIA CLARA:
Hm.

---

## GARDY:
I figured they were just busy.

---

Y’know, carrying on with other studies throughout the building.

---

## JOE:
Okay.

---

Sure.

---

## MARIA CLARA:
Oh.

---

## JOE & GARDY:
Oh?

---

## MARIA CLARA:
“Human connection is such a precious phenomenon.

---

You don’t realize how much you truly need it until suddenly it’s ripped from your hands.

---

We thank you for your time.

---

We hope that these shared moments that you’ve had these past few days have been everything you’ve missed over the last few years.

---

There was never anything more than water in the cups you drank from.

---

Our goal was to simulate three people sharing stories over a drink.

---

Something that could help you feel normal again.

---

We wanted to see if normal was even something that we could even achieve today, or if many aspects of our lives have, in fact, changed.

---

Even the way we tell our stories.

---

We thank you for showing up.

---

We thank you for experiencing this.

---

Thank you for choosing to participate.”
