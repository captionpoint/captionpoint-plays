[“You Are My Heaven” plays]

---

### DONNY (recorded, sung):

An angel whispered to me When I woke this morning

---

Said I would find heaven by my side

---


And there you were you angel Heaven in the morning

---

Laying in my arms and in my life And I make this decision: 

---

I love you, my religion…. 
### Donny:
Wait, wait…that’s…

---

### Donny (recorded, sung):
Heaven’s in my soul and in my heart…

### Donny:
I hear something else.

---

[Recorder Stops]

Let’s try that.

---

### Donny (Singing, and playing piano):

I love you, my religion… 
Heaven’s in my soul and in my heart

---

[Donny sings and plays the same phrase multiple times]

I love you, my religion… 
Heaven’s in my soul and in my heart

---

---

It stopped recording?

---

---

[Donny starts playing again, and tries to get the recorder to work.]

---

[Recorder breaks]

---

Ok. I don’t have time for this.

---

---

[Plays the intro to the song again]

---

[Static from the recorder]

---

Damn it!

---

---

I need to breathe Breathe Donny

---

[Donny takes a breath between each line]

Tapes mess up all the time.

---

You have more of them.

---

Just breathe Donny

[Phone Rings]

---

Hello? Hey Eric, man, I’m sorr……

---

No really I’m……Yeah…ok……

---

Yeah, yeah, I’m good man. 

---

Tell Roberta and the guys I’m sorry and tomorrow, I’ll be ready to roll……

---

Groovy. Bye.

---

---

God, I uh. . .

---

I feel like I'm losing 

---

Losing control

My music 

My spirit 

---

My life Like I can't quite grasp… 

---

Take hold of the moment 

I need this moment

---

I need to fix it 

Fix me

---

Break the hold it has on me 

Help me

---

Mind interruption. Distraction. Focus Donny 

---

Everyone’s counting on me, Lord. 

---

Roberta, Eric, the band, Atlantic, all of them 

---

They need me

The REAL me

---

Not whoever that was 

We need to get this

---

My babies depend on me.

I’ve got to get in control 

---

Control my space and time 

---

Focus

---

[He begins to play again]

---

An angel whispered to me 
When I woke this morning

---

Said I would find heaven by my side 

---

And there you were you angel 
Heaven in the morning

---

Laying in my arms and in my life

---

And I make this decision: 
I love you, my religion 

---

Heaven’s in my soul and in my heart

---

No one could ever change my mind, oh, no 
‘Cause I got you here right by my side.

---


### A VOICE (recorded):

DONNY!!!!

---

### DONNY:

What the f…

---

How did they...

---

---

Oh God. They’ve been in here.

---

Planted something in here.

---

---

[He mutters to himself, getting panicked]

---

[The phone rings, but it sounds strange, different than before]

---

### A VOICE (recorded):

DONNY!!!!

---

---

[Mutters to himself and goes to take his medicine]

---

[He throws his medicine to the wall, saying he doesn't want to take the medicine, muttering continues]

---

### Donny:
Get it together... get it together.... get back to work

---

---

### Donny:
Who are you? 

---

What is this? How did you…

---

Are you with them?

---

Wait

---

Wait

---

You seem 

---

Different

---

I can feel you 

---

A part of me Connected

---

Ask and it shall be given. 

---

Seek and ye shall find.

---

Knock and the door shall be open unto you. Kindred spirits

---

My Grandma would say nothing happens without purpose 

---

So you must be here for a reason

---

To help me. Focus. Be my muse. My muses. Yeah. My angels.

---

I uh had gotten used to it 

---

Ya know Used it

---

These uh…Let’s say… distractions 

---

I could diffuse it with my music 

---

Focus the energy Twist them into melodies

---

See, Grandma taught me to focus 

---

My father wasn't there My mother wasn't ready 

---

So Grandma took me 

Raised me

Trained me

---

Taught me everything I know.

---

Martha Crumwell 

---

She ain't play

---

She was no-nonsense

---

Especially when it came to her God

---

There was no secular activity in or around her house 

---

Sometimes I think she would pray I messed up

---

Just so she could brag on God 

---

Learn me how good He is

---

She stayed on me, man

---

Lil Donny do this 

Lil Donny do that

What you doin? 

---

What'd I say?

---

Boy, if that ain’t a note on that piano I don’t want to hear it.

---

Sat me right down at that piano There was no getting around it Playing for hours

---

Fingers hurting 

Wrists tired

---

[He practices. Playing what he describes]

Totality

---

It's my music 

Mine

My responsibility 

---

Grandma gave it to me 

Taught me good

---

I've held it close 

Planted it into my soul 

---

Let it grow

Made me, ME

---

Musical. Musician. I hear it all before I write it. The Music.

---

[Funky music plays]

She did that.

---

She’d say

“Make it a part of you, baby.” 

---

3 years old.

Gig-ing with Grandma

---

Little Donny Pitts. The Nation’s Youngest Gospel Singer.

[DONNY begins to play and sing as Little Donny Pitts.]

---

[“HOW MUCH I OWE”]

You bought me, Lord You paid the price
I belong to you

---

You bought me, Lord You paid the price
I belong to you

---

You bought me, Lord 
You paid the price
I belong to you

---

And I'll do what you want me to do 

---

How much I owe for love divine 

---

How much I owe since Christ is mine 

---

What He means to me, I know
I cannot tell how much I owe

---

You bought me, Lord 
You paid the price
I belong to you'

---

You bought me, Lord 
You paid the price
I belong to you

---

You bought me, Lord 
You paid the price
I belong to you

---


And I'll do what you want me to do

---

[Music stops, he laughs]

---

I remember I tried to talk back to her one time 

---

Stand my ground, ya dig

---

All young men go through it 

We've got to take the test 

---

Whether we pass or not

I told my Grandma

---

Say “I’m not gone play that piano no more. 

I’m through with it jack”

---

She turned to me 

And stared

---

And she had a good one

Just stared

---

I stared back

Feeling good about myself

---

Before I knew it She took two steps

Showed me the devil with her back hand 

---

Jesus with her fore hand

And sent the Holy Ghost up my spine 

---

Grabbed my face and said

"Don't you ever let me hear that again 

---

You USE the gifts God gave you.

They’re for HIS will.

---

No one else’s. Not even YOURS. 

Let Him use you, baby.

---

She taught me that 

She prepared me 

---

Gave me all the tools

It's as if she knew exactly what I needed 

---

She knew there would be these

… Distractions


---

Daddy had them.

---

But his lacked melody.

---

War.

Explosions. 

---

Gun fire and screams were his music. 

---

No escape.

Lost his song

---

Can’t lose mine

You see

I've got to keep it 

---

Gotta finish it.

For Grandma

---

I know she’s watching. I want to make her proud. 

---

I've always tried to keep Gospel in my music

---

The undertones have always been there 

You can hear it if you listen

---

Listen close

---

[Plays Amazing Grace, then sings “You’ve got a friend in me”]

---

How sweet the sound

---


I’ll come running to see you again

---

I was learning my style in high school 

---

[School Bell Rings]

Vashon High School

---

Wolverines!

St. Louis, Missouri

---

I guess that's where I caught the R&B bug 

---

I was shy back then

Still shy

---

It may be hard to believe. I mean, I don’t feel shy with you, 

---

like when I’m on stage.

But, it’s different up there. It’s like I leave my body. 

---

Can watch myself. Like a dream.

---

I remember having these vivid dreams in school. 

---

Daydreams

---

I don't know why I'm talking about this right now 

To you

---

So uh

In these daydreams

---

This…I don’t know…

The doctors would call it…

---

My Grandma would say spirit or even maybe… 

---

Let’s just call him Duke

---

Must have been, maybe, some sort of alter ego of mine. 

---

Duke could do all of the things I couldn't.

Talk to ladies

---

Stand up to the fellahs 

Play those keys with fire. 

Made me feel confident.

---

People respected him, or him in me, or…us? We were a team. 

---

Maybe that's where it started

---

Maybe that’s who I’m seeing when I’m on stage “watching myself”... 

---

I never thought about that before

---

But his dark side…even I wasn’t exempt.

---

I was working on a song for the talent show when he turned on me. 

---

Well… the first time

---

I was in the zone.

My element.

---

I could hear the other students’ “oohh's and aahh's” 

---

I’m feeling it. I’m feeling “him”. Then,

A flash

---

Then I hear him I hear him

---

He say:

---

[Machine Static]

### DUKE (recorded):

Scream!

---

### Donny:

I didn’t want to scream 

---

I wanted to sing

I tell him no 

---

Shake my head

It ain't real Donny 

It ain't

---

I tell myself this but I'm seeing him right in front of me 

---

I'm not dreaming

I'm seeing

---

### DUKE (recorded):

Scream!

---

### DONNY:

I said no

---

He takes a step closer 

Doubles in size

---

He just wants me to obey. Control me. 

---

I say no again.

He grabs me by the throat 

---

It ain't real Donny!

It ain't!

---

He starts to squeeze

I feel my breath leaving 

---

I'm suffocating

Straining on the inside but my body ain't moving

---

### DUKE (recorded):

Scream!

---

### DONNY:

Ahhhhhhh!!

---

He smiles 

Grip loosens

[He coughs]

---

I find my breath

Trying to find my thoughts 

---

Silence

Alone

---

Everybody just looking at me

---

But it wasn't real

---

Was it?

---

If I had moments like this 

---

I learned First thing I want to do is get to my piano

---

Didn't know where else to go

I would put it into my music

---

I could Sit down

Put my fingers to the keys

---

[Begins playing]

And let everything else go

Releasing the toxins 

---

Through my fingertips

---

Anger

---

Love

---

Frustration

---

Irritation

---

Turning chaos into beauty

---

Song after song after song

---

[Singing]
I was dreaming of the past,

---

And my heart was beating fast.

---

I began to lose control.

---

I began to lose control.

---

I didn’t mean to hurt you,
And I’m sorry I made you cry.

---

I didn’t want to hurt you, no I didn’t. 

---

I'm just a jealous guy.

---

[Back to speaking normally]
Exorcism of demons. 

---

Duke peeked through me 

---

I felt gritty

Deep dark passion

---

A passion that can only be felt

in the bile-filled belly of Jealousy 

---

Can’t be nice and sweet

Jealousy ain’t nice and sweet

---

[Singing]
I was feeling insecure.

---

You might not want me anymore. 

---

I was shivering inside.

---

I was shivering inside.

---

I didn’t mean to hurt you, And I’m sorry I made you cry.

---

I didn’t want to hurt you, no I didn’t. 

---

I’m just a jealous guy!

---

I’m just a jealous guy, yes I am.

---

I don’t want nobody looking at you.

---

I’m just a jealous kinda fellow

---

I don’t want…

---

[Suddenly shifts to speaking, he yells at someone]

I don’t want NOBODY LOOKING AT YOU!

He’s all in your face

---

Why is he in your face?!

---

I don’t want nobody looking at you! 

But it’s cool for you, right?

---

This fool in your damn face. 

---

Who is he?!

Who is he Eulaulah?!!

---

Do you hear me talking to you?!! 

EULAULAH!!!! ANSWER ME!

---

[A Hard knock at the door]

---

---

[Doony plays “MORE THAN YOU’LL EVER KNOW”]

---

### Donny (singing):
If I ever leave you

---

You could say I told you so

---

And if I ever ever hurt you

---

You know I hurt myself as well

---

Is that any way for a man to carry on

---

Do you think I want my loved one gone

---

Said I love you, 

---

more than you'll ever know

---

More than you'll ever know

---

When I wasn't making much money

---

You know where my paycheck went

---

You know, I brought it home to you, baby

---

And I never spent a red cent

---

Is that anyway for a man to carry on,

---

Do you think I want my loved one gone. 

---

Said I love you

---

More than you'll ever know, yeah

---

More than you'll ever know

---

[Music gets more intense]
Now listen to this…

---

I’m not trying to be

---

Just any kind of man, no, I ain’t

---

I’m just trying to be somebody

---

You can love, trust and understand

---

I know, I know, I know that I could be

---

A part of you that no one else could see

---

But I got to hear ya say, I got to hear ya say

---

Its alright

---

I’m only flesh and blood

---

But I can be anything that you demand

---

I can be king of everything

---

Or just a tiny grain of sand

---

Now tell me…

Is that anyway for a man to carry on

---

Do you think I want my loved one gone?

---

I love you more than you’ll ever know

---

I said I love you. I love you. I love you, ahhhhhhhnd.

---

I don’t want nobody else. I don’t need nobody else.

---

I just want you, baby, for myself.

---

This is the reason why. ‘Cause I looooooooooooove you. Baby.

---

I said I want you. I need you. Yeah, mhmm mhmm.

---

[End of song]

---

Eulaulah

---

Eulaulah

---

Eulaulah worries 

---

My wife

---

She worries

---

We’re separated but she still worries. 

---

She knows

---

More than I'll ever know

---

She doesn’t think I should be working right now. 

---

Thinks I’m not ready.

I’ve already had 5 years of silence. Emptiness. 

---

So much music in my head. Jumbled notes.

Wouldn’t make sense. Couldn’t write them down. 

---

Lost hope in myself.

She tried so hard but

---

She couldn't figure me out

---

It was all taken from me.

Everything.

---

Everything I had to give 

She had to give

---

They ruined everything 

---

When it was good

---

It was good 

---

We were great

Back in school?!

Howard University

The walls transform and take us to the steps of Howard University.

---

On the steps

To see her walk by 

---

God

---

My God

I was happy at Howard 

Yea

It was the ONLY school I ever wanted to go to

But one thing you don't have to worry about 

---

Women

The women at Howard flow a plenty 

And not just any kind of women

Smart 

Sexy

Intellectual 

Driven 

---

Sassy 

Powerful 

Women

---

Met Eulaulah at Howard 

---

Eulaulah Vann

---

She was something, man 

---

Brought me joy

Gave me something to be thankful for 

---

Write about

Sing about 

---

Full

I was full

---

She filled me up 

She walked by

---

### Donny (As Himself):
“What's your name?”

### Donny (As Eulalah):
“I don't talk to strangers”

---

### Donny (As Himself):
“Well I'm Mr. Hathaway And you look like Mrs. Hathaway would fit you just right” 

---

### Donny (As Eulalah):
“The thought is better than that line you just gave me”

---

### Donny (As Himself):
“I'm gonna write a song about you” 

---

### Donny (As Eulalah):
“You don't even know my name”

---

### Donny:
I didn't need to know 

---

Her walk

---

Her talk 

Eyes

---

Lips

Hips Legs 

---

Definition

Sun-kissed skin 

---

Her hair

Swing 

---

Swing

---

I knew everything I needed to know 

---

She sang to me

---

Notes

Drifting in her scent 

---

Floating

---

Her aura 

Look at her 

---

Ooooo man

---

She knew what she was doing

---

I had no clue what I was getting myself into 

---

Thinking about her

Sat by that piano all night 

---

That night

Unlike Grandma

---

She didn't even have to ask me to 

---

Fingers hurting

Wrist tired

---

No distractions 

Just her

---

Me 

Melodies

---

Keys dancing

Sky Clear

---

[He begins to play]

---

[He sings]
I've learned to live for the sound of her laughter 

---

Her sunny smile is my only light

---

To love her now is the sole thing that I am after

---

I'll make her melody my life

---

She came to me when I knew I'd lost the meaning

---

Lifted the shadow from across my way

---

She touched my heart with the sweet song she was singing

---

Brought back the sun into my days

---

Ooohhhhhhhhhhh she is my lady

---

I'm a witness to the wonder of her ways 

---

Oohhhhhhhh she's my lady

---

The solitary reason for my days

---

And sometimes when my burdens just seem too overbearing 

---

The girl turns my tears with a single sigh

---

She taught me love and through love we both learned sharing 

---

Right now she's every, every reason why

---

Oooohhhh she is my lady

---

I'm a witness to the wonder of her ways

---

Oh, oh oh she's my lady

---

The solitary reason for my days, oh oh

---

Mmmhhh, mmmmhh

---

---

Woah, Woah, Oh oh oh

---

I don’t have to worry
Cause she is my lady. 

---

She is my lady. Yes she is.

---

I’m a witness to the wonder of her ways

---

I’m so grateful she is my lady

---

The one and only reason for my days 

---

---

Won’t you help me sing it?

---

Oh oh oh she is my lady. Yes she is.

---

I’m a witness to the wonder of her ways

---

Oh, oh oh she’s my lady. Yes she is.

---

The one and only reason for my days

---

For my days

---

For my days

---

[Song Ends]

---

My God

---

If I could just go back 

---

Do it again

---

Just me and my lady 

Start over

---

No distractions No machine…

---

I uh- She uh- 

---

Yea

---

I miss her 

---

She's amazing 

---

Strong

She covered me 

---

She faced me

I couldn't face her

---

Eulaulah could hear me 

Could see me

---

Read me like a bible Ya know? 

---

With purpose

Like I mean something

---

Meant something 

---

She knew me

Then it was like she was part of it, you know? 

---

No, you don’t.

---

Ok so these white folks hooked this machine to my brain. 

---

I don’t know how

No, I do 

The meds

---

They said it was to help with my distractions, but really, 

---

It’s trying to steal my music

My sound

---

SHE MADE ME TAKE THEM

That medicine

---

### Donny (As Eulalah):
“Donny, I’m just trying to help. You need them.”

---

### Donny (As Himself):
“Don’t tell me what I need! Don’t EVER tell me what I need!!!” 

---

### Donny (As Eulalah):
“I can’t take you like this.”

---

### Donny (As Himself):
“I knew it. They got to you, didn’t they?

---

"You’re with them, aren’t you?!” 

---

### Donny (As Eulalah):
“Donny...I can’t!”

---

### Donny:
Why didn't she listen to me? 

---

I didn't understand

That she didn't understand 

---

That the pills

The medicine

---

It’s all a part of the plan you see 

Their machine

---

Making me fade away

Making it easier to take from me

---

Steal

She could see what it did to me 

---

She knew when “me” wasn’t “me” 

She was on their side

---

I needed her on my side. Make me, me again. 

---

I wanted her to be my medicine

---

I couldn't 

I didn't

---

I didn't know how to trust her 

---

Was she real?

Was this the woman I loved?

---

Or was she placed here by them? A decoy? 

---

I couldn't tell the difference

---

---

Eulaulah.

She just wanted to protect our girls.

---

Our beautiful girls. Lalah and Kenya.

---

My babies. And sweet Donnita. Different mother. Charlotte

---

All my blessings. You should hear them trying to sing my songs.

---

### Donny (As one of his children):
“Hang oh da misotoe. I wanna git to know you betta. Bum Bum Bum. Dis Christmas.”

---

### Donny:
What’s ‘oh da misotoe’?

---

I love my babies. It’s something about that oldest one, though. 

---

Always something about the firstborn.

---

But it’s more than just that with Lalah. 

I don’t know what it is.

---

She has these eyes 

She stares

---

Just sits and stares at me 

Stares through me

---

Piercing my soul 

All my secrets

---

I remember her sitting at the piano, her banging away 

---

[As Lalah] C’mon Daddy

---

Go ahead baby, play,

---

[Donny plays and sings]
You bought me, Lord 
You paid the price
I belong to you

---

Go ahead, baby

---

[Donny plays and sings]
You bought me, Lord 
You paid the price
I belong to you

---

[Strange sound, Donny stops playing]

It ain’t real Donny

---

### LALAH (recorded)

Daddy?

### DONNY:

Keep playing baby.

---

How much I owe for love divine -

---

### DUKE (Recorded):

SCREAM!

---

### DONNY:

Lalah go! Get out of here! Go to your room! Go!!! 

---

Ahhhhhhhhh!!!

---

### LALAH (Recorded):

He gonna get us Daddy?

---

### DONNY:

She just stared for a moment then, 

---

No baby. I’m sorr...

---

It’s ok baby. He’s gone. It’s ok.

---

No father should have to...

---

No child should have to...

---

How do I make sense of it. Explain what just happened. I can't 

---

What do I say

Daddy's crazy? 

---

She should not have to understand that. She is just a child, my child

---

My babies… they always remind of good times. 

---

They make me think of my youth.

---

The good ole days. My prime.

---

Working with everybody on the scene.

---

The Unifics, The Staple Singers, Jerry Butler, Aretha Franklin, Curtis Mayfield and the Impressions.

---

Gigging with Ric Powell 

The Ric Powell Trio 

---

Music flowing 

Everywhere

All the time

---

Man walk up say:

“Hey Ric, give me some skin. I want you to meet somebody” 

---

He looking at me

I say, “Uh, That's Ric back there on the drums” 

---

He thought I was Ric.

Thought I was the boss.

---

Me.

---

I started to think maybe I could be 

Why not me

---

We were all over D.C.

People knew my name.

---

I was him.

The new guy 

---

Donny.

I was bad.

---

Still struggling with Du-- with my demons 

But the good outweighed the bad jack

---

Ric & Steve, they accepted me 

Didn't judge me

---

I remember

We were eating at a little diner in Georgetown 

---

There was this woman

I didn't know her 

---

We didn't know her

But I swear she kept giving me these looks

---

Like she was watching me for somebody 

Taking notes

---

Every time I looked up

She was already looking at me

---

Waiter!

---

Hey! You need to take yo ass home and take care of your kids! 

---

She acted all surprised

Like she ain't do nothing

---

She knew what she was doing 

Watching me

---

Ric and Steve didn't say nothing 

---

Probably figured I was stressed out

---

We were all stressed out 

---

We were struggling man 

---

As a people

As a society 

---

Fighting the man 

Fighting each other 

---

Riots in Detroit

---

Martin Luther King Jr 

---

John

Robert Kennedy 

Killed

---

Brothers 

Lost

---

Brothers

Lost

---

Where was the love?

Like Marvin Gaye, Ray Charles, Stevie Wonder. 

---

I tried to put it into my music

The bombs

---

The people crying 

The distress 

---

Twist it

Change it

---

Modulate 

Transforming scars 

---

Into marks of beauty 

---

Distractions

Into melodies

[He begins to hum a tune]

---

Bass!

[A Bass is added to the song]

---

Yes, this is the ghetto 

Drums!

[Drums are added to the song]

---

Sho’ nuff now

Yeah. I feel that

---

You feel that?

---

Keys 

---

Keys. 

---

KEYS!

---

Oh...That’s me

---

[Donny plays, and hums the tune]

---

I see it 

The notes

---

Can you see it?

Can you see me?

---

Twisting 

Bending 

Swinging 

Dancing

---

From my roots

Growing up in the Projects 

---

Carr Square Village

St. Louis, Missouri 

---

The Gateway Arch 

The Riverfront

Busch Stadium 

---

Proud

I got to show

---

I got to speak for my people 

---

---

[Sings the tune happily]

---

[Donny adds some percussion to the tune as he sings about The Ghetto]

---

[Beings singing with the audience]

Hey fellas, Sing this for me

---

“The Ghetto, Oh yeah”

Sing fellas

---

My lady angels sing this for me

“Talking ‘bout the ghetto”

---

Everybody sing that song "The Ghetto!"

Give me a little soul clap

---

[Clapping with the audience]

---

[Donny does some call and response singing with the audience]

---

I wanted you to see me 

See I was with you 

---

Always have been.

You understand?

---

Could you hear my pain? 

I could hear yours 

---

Heard your voices

I could see you suffering

---

For you it was the chaos of the country 

For me

---

The chaos of my conscience 

Both at war fighting for our lives 

---

For time and space

---

A moment 

A breath 

---

A note

---

Didn't matter

---

Quarter

Half 

Whole 

---

To hold As your own

All I wanted to do was help 

---

You

Me 

Connect

---

Wires crossing

I thought I could hold your pain for you 

---

Swallow the suffering

And you would hear mine

---

I was trying to keep you safe 

With my music

---

---

[Phone Rings]

---

See, that's why they connected this machine to my brain 

---

Started watching me

They could see

---

They knew I was connecting with you

They don’t want that

---

They knew I was special 

Vulnerable

---

They thought I would turn you against them 

---

That's why they want to steal my music

To turn you against me! 

---

[Phone Rings Again]

Make you think I'm crazy 

---

Steal my song

Like my Daddy 

---

I can't

I won’t let them have it 

---

My Grandma gave it to me 

So I could give it to you

---

Through melodies you can feel

Take hold of and know that you're not alone

---

[Another ring. DONNY sings “EVERYTHING IS EVERYTHING”]

---

[Phone is ringing angrily now, in rhythm with his song]

I hear voices, I see people

---

I hear voices of many people

---

Oh Yeah
I hear voices, I see people

---

I hear voices of many people 
Sayin’ everything is everything

---

---

I need you to hear me 

I need you to see me 

---

I do

---

Hear

See

---

Things 

Voices

People 

---

You

---

Does that make me crazy? 

---

What's the difference?

---

In the way I think, I mean 

---

How my brain works

As opposed to yours 

Processes

---

Don't look at me like I'm only one

People talk to themselves

---

Talk themselves out of things 

Talk themselves into things 

---

Communicating

Negotiating 

---

Time and space

But they say I’m diseased 

---

Yeah

They want to put that on me 

---

Because the dis-ease is theirs

---

Because they lack understanding of my ability 

Want to make it a disability

---

Seems to me like there is a very thin line between the two 

---

A tightrope

---

With my music we are communicating on a higher plane 

---

Grooving

---

Minds intertwined 

Invested in rhythms 

---

Flawless duets

No they don't want that

---

Said they were trying to help me

I don't see how those hospitals can help me 

---

Anybody!

---

Those rooms

---

Those little bitty ass rooms 

---

I couldn't breathe

Closing in on me

---

Don't sound right in this 

---

Closing in

It don't sound right 

---

This little room

---

My melodies 

Too prominent 

---

Substantial 

They need space

---

Riffs can't fly in concealed spaces 

They've got to breathe

---

I've got to breathe

My notes can’t fit in this space

---

Bouncing too quick from one wall to the next 

---

Strings don't bounce, they swing

Swing

---

There's no solace 

No peace

---

No space

Everywhere voices 

---

Everywhere people 

People watching 

---

Listening

Like you

---

Waiting for me to do something wrong 

---

Plotting

They're all a part of the machine

---

[Buzzer]

Like clockwork 

---

Nothing changes 

---

No modulation 

---

Blank space

---

How can you feel better in a space that isn't yours? 

---

And doesn't feel like you

---

Feeding me pills as meals 

---

That's the worst part

---

[Buzzer]

---

Chlorpromazine

Or also called Thorazine 

---

Anti-psychotic

---

Take this one twice a day

'To relieve symptoms of schizophrenia 

---

Side effects include

Blurred Vision 

---

Dizziness Drowsiness Anxiety And insomnia

---

So I'm sleepy but I can't go to sleep 

Not to mention

---

Weight gain Dry mouth Stuffy nose Constipation And Impotence

---

So on both ends it's a no go 

---

Purgatory

---

That's not even the worst of it jack 

---

Look at this guy

---

Haloperidol 

---

A doozy

---

Another anti-psychotic but tougher

Two to three times a day

Problems thinking clearly 

Or moving my body 

---

Seizures

---

Severe muscle stiffness

---

Like rigor mortis for the living ya dig 

---

My body gets stuck in a position 

---

And there's nothing I can do about it 

---

Dystonia

Repetitive muscle contractions 

---

Painful

---

My body gets all twisted up 

---

Uncontrollable movement of the tongue Face Mouth Or jaw

---

I'm trying to speak

---

And my tongue just spurts out of my mouth 

---

Jaw locks up Grinding my teeth together 

---

Like I'm Pinocchio And the pills are holding the strings

---

Then there is Lanzipan,

---

Norepinephrine, 

---

Risperidone,

---

Olanzapine

---

[Buzzer]

“Take your pills Donny."

---

But you know what they do to me!

---

They erase me 

---

My mind numbs 

---

Creativity clouds

---

My ears blind to the dancing melodies 

---

The swinging tones

Those damn pills 

---

Damn doctors

I don't feel better 

---

Just less distracted

Void of melody

---

Yes, the voices quiet

---

The people, Duke, all disappear 

But so do I

---

I become a book of blank pages 

---

"You're paranoid schizophrenic."

They label me

---

Those doctors 

My friends 

Family

---

Seems like you can survive anything Until someone tells you, you can't

---

I didn't even know the word 

Schizophrenic

---

But see On the pills 

---

That's ALL I am 

---

Schizophrenic 

---

Fractured sounds 

Fissured verses 

---

Fuzzy lyrics 

---

Nothing

---

Blank pages

---

A dictionary with no words 

---

A flower without petals

---

A piano no keys

---

If I got to choose between that Or Hearing voices And seeing people

---

You ain't got to ask me but once 

---

Those damn hospitals

Almost killed me 

---

Losing myself 

---

My music

---

Alone 

---

Until

---

Until I found

---

In a little corner 

---

At the hospital 

Community space 

---

It was good

It was home

---

A space for me 

---

52 White

36 Black

---

Keys

---

Wasn't perfect 

But it was mine 

---

I would play

---

And the walls would open up 

---

My breath would return

---

My melodies 

My notes

---

For a moment
Those keys 

It was home

---

Glimpses of normalcy 

---

Sitting
Unsilent

Robust 

---

Movement

---

An open window

---

[Donny mimics the sounds on the piano]

Cars passing 

---

Birds

---

Horns 

---

Wind 

God 

Totality

---

Grandma said, “Use it all, Donny” 

Use everything

---

Use something can’t nobody else hear. 

---

That's what makes your music special 

Took me a while to gain understanding

---

[Donny plays some chords on the piano]

It started clicking

---

Steps, Coughing, Crying, Talking Laughing 

---

Unpredictable

---

Vulnerable 

---

Open

---

Felt good in my fingers 

---

Dancing

---

Danced along the keys 

---

Sometimes rough 

Rugged

Bold 

---

Sometimes soft

---

[Donny begins to play once more]

---

[Singing]
I've been so many places in my life and time

---

I've sung a lot of songs, made some bad rhyme

---

I've acted out my life in stages

---

With ten thousand people watching

---

We're alone now I'm singin' this song to you

---

I know your image of me is what I hope to be

---

I've treated you unkindly but darling can't you see

---

There's no one more important to me

---

Baby can't you see through me

---

'Cause we're alone now and I'm singin' this song to you

---

You showed me precious secrets of a true love, withholdin' nothin'

---

You came out in front and I was hiding

---

But now I'm so much better so if my words don't come together

---

Listen to the melody 'cause my love's in there hiding

---

[Instrumental Break]

---

I love you in a place where there's no space or time

---

I've loved you for my life, you're a friend of mine

---

And when my life is over, remember when we were together

---

We were alone and I was singin' my song to you

---

We were alone and I was singin' this song to you

---

We were alone and I was singin' this song

---

It’s the only thing I can trust 

---

Give to it and it gives back

---

It doesn't ask questions 

---

It doesn't judge me

---

It's always there when I need it

---

[Donny seamlessly transitions into “Someday we will be free”]

---

Hang on to the world as it spins around

---

Don’t you let the spin get you down

---

Things are moving fast

---

Hold on tight and you will last

---

Keep your self-respect, your manly pride

---

Get yourself in gear

---

Keep your stride

---

Never mind your fears

---

Brighter days will soon be here

---

Take it from me, someday we'll all be free

---

Keep on walking tall

---

Hold your head up high

---

Lay your dreams right up to the sky

---

Sing your greatest song

---

And you'll keep going, going on

---

Take it from me, someday we'll all be free

---

Hey, just wait and see, someday we'll all be free

---

Take it from me, someday we'll all be free

---

[Speaking]

I could look at my music and see I was special 

---

You know what that is?

---

To look at something and see the reflection of God in you? 

---

When you have that you can cope with anything

---

No matter how hard it is 

---

I try to hold on

---

I tell myself, 

---

Hang on Donny,

---

[Singing]
“Just hang on to the world as it spins around”

---

[Song ends]

---

You thought I was talking about you 

---

My people

---

I guess I was

But I was talking about me 

---

My pain

My freedom

---

Trying to avoid making decisions I couldn't take back 

---

Come back from

See, you don’t understand it. 

---

The schizophrenia.

When you see it in me.

---

But in my music, [He plays]

---

you accept it. You call me a musical genius. 

---

I thought by putting it in my music

I was taking it off of me 

---

My heart

But I am music and it is me 

---

We can't be separated

We share the same heartbeat 

---

Boom boom tick boom boom tick 

---

Music

---

Swing swing 

---

My mood

---

Swing swing 

---

Emotions 

---

Swing swing

---

Duke, ever present in me

Pushing everything, everyone away. 

---

My family

My friends 

---

My heartbeat

---

Roberta helped me find my heartbeat again 

---

We hadn’t spoken in years

---

From together all the time to abject absence 

---

But she never forgot me

In my solitude, reached for me

---

### Voice:
“Mr. Hathaway, a Ms. Flack is on the phone” 

---

### Donny:
Pulled me out of the depths of darkness 

---

Reviving my soul

With her light Her spirit.

---

[A woman sings “The closer I get to you”]

### Woman:
The closer I get to you

---

The more you make me see

---

By giving me all you've got

---

Your love has captured me

---

### Donny:
Oh Roberta. My Roberta. 

---

Muse of all muses.

---

We’ve always been close. 

---

From the beginning.

An unexplainable connection 

---

Musically, mentally tethered 

Where I end, she begins 

---

Roberta understands

---

She sees all of me

---

Normal, abnormal, happy, depressed, crazy 

---

Whatever you want to call it

She sees it over and over

---

[Singing]
Over and over again

---

I tried to tell myself that we 
Could never be more than friends 

---

And all the while inside
I knew it was real

---

The way you make me feel

---

[Speaking]

She makes me...feel.

---

Senses heightened.

Atmosphere buzzing.

---

I wanted her to understand me. How deep I felt. 

---

How she affected me with her essence.

---

Awed by her mind and beauty. 

---

I wanted more

Wanted never to lose her again. 

---

I let my music speak for me.

---

Thought she would understand when we sang “The Closer I Get to You” 

---

When we sang “Where Is the Love”.

---

I needed her to get it.

---

When I sang,

[Donny plays and sings “For all we know”]

---

For all we know

---

We may never meet again

---

Before you go

---

Make this moment sweet again

---

We won’t say goodnight

---

Until the last minute

---

I’ll hold out my hand

---

And my heart will be in it

---

For all we know

---

This may only be a dream

---

We come and we go

---

Like the ripples of a stream

---

So love me, love me tonight

---

Tomorrow was made for some

---

Tomorrow may never come

---

For all we know

---

#### As DONNY and Roberta:
“I love you”

---

### Roberta:
“Aww. I love you, too...my friend”

---

### Donny:
She didn’t get it.

---

Or wouldn’t allow herself to.

---

She didn’t see that it was my pain that she strummed with her fingers. 

---

My life she sang with her words

---

So once again I'm alone 

---

Hiding my real feelings

My real thoughts

---

My real

---

But is it real? 

---

Or only pretend 

Only songs 

---

Fake feelings

---

I don’t know how to pretend

---

Seems like no matter how much light she pours into me 

---

Darkness swallows it up

---

Black holes

Dragging me back to the depths 

---

Standing on sinking sand

I don’t want to go back there! 

---

---

But I got you now

---

My angels

You’re gonna help me.

---

I need to work.

Yeah, get back to the work. 

---

Get back to work.

---

[Donny returns to the piano]

---

An angel whispered to me

When I woke this morning

---

Said I would find heaven by my side

---

And there you were you angel Heaven in the morning

---

Laying in my arms and in my life

---

And I make this decision: I love you, my religion

---

Heaven’s in my soul and in my heart

---

No one could ever change my mind, oh, no

---

‘Cause I got you here right by my side.

---

You are my love 
You are my heaven

---

You are my love
Make me sing, la di da

---

You are my love
You are my heaven

---

Darling, I, oh
I can’t let them take you away

---

Hey hey hey, hey hey hey heyyyyyy

---

Allllll-RIGHT! That’s the one!

---

“This may work. Has worked.”

Groovy….groovy, groovy.

---

Wait till Roberta and Eric hear this! 

---

Duke destroyed the session tonight. 

---

No, 

---

I destroyed the session.

---

I can’t remember if Roberta, or any of them had seen me that…bad. Eric’s face

---

Roberta’s fear 

Bewilderment, even

---

I’m on the floor, huddled in a corner 

---

Yelling, breathing

---

“Is it drugs? Is it not? Is this what people were talking about?” 

---

Get a do-over tomorrow. Amen!

---

Still in my moment

---

[The recorder makes a strange sound]

---

---

Playing tricks on me

---

You can handle it, Donny 

---

Grandma taught me

I'm in control 

---

Use it all 

---

Totality

---

[The Channel flips on it’s own, louder]

It ain't real Donny 

It ain't

---

Hold on to that seed

---

[The radio plays voices of Duke, Lala, and others]

I can't focus!

---

God!

Please 

---

Fix it 

Fix me

---

Break the hold it has on me 

---

Help me!

---

[All of the sounds get louder]

---

See how the distractions get louder 

---

Become real

---

Louder than my own thoughts 

---

Don't give in

Don't give up

---

I need you to help me 

---

I can't…

---

The constant 

Distractions

---

Breaking the peace 

My peace

---

My moment 

---

My mind

---

Stop it 

---

Stop it!

---

[The radio stops, and there is a long pause, before music begins to play]

Wait 

---

Wait

---

How'd you get that?

---

We still have to lay that down 

I didn’t finish my vocals…

---

No no no no no no no no no 

---

You can't

That's not possible 

---

That's our music 

Our song 

---

Roberta?

---

Why would she… 

---

Not my Roberta 

---

No no no no no 

---

Can't be

---

That's what that sound was 

---

In my recorder

---

They set me up 

---

Trying to sabotage me 

---

Spies in my camp

---

In my space

---

Stealing my melodies 

My secrets

---

Not today

---

[Donny plays “You are my heaven” loudly on the piano, trying his best to be louder than the radio]

---

Give it back! 

---

It's mine 

My music 

---

Mine to give
Not yours to take 

---

It's for them not you 

Them.

---

Grandma gave it to me 

---

My God gave it to me

---

I can't let it go 

I won't.

---

[Donny yells louder than ever!]

Leave me alone, Duke!!! 

---

Get off of me!!!

---

[Donny Screams]

---

---

I'm tired 

---

I'm lost

---

Lost the ability to control 

---

Me

---

My life

My music

---

### THE AUDIENCE (recorded):

“We love you, Donny” “Sing ‘The Ghetto’!” “DONNY!!” 

---

“Why do you wear that hat? “Sing boy!!!”

### Donny:
What’s going on?

---

### THE AUDIENCE (recorded):
What’s wrong with you?” “You fat.” “DONNY!”

### DONNY:
Why do you sound like... 

---

### THE AUDIENCE (recorded):
“Are you gay?” “DAMN, you BLACK black.”

### DONNY:
How are you doing that? 

---

### THE AUDIENCE (recorded):
“Look at the hairline!” “You crazy as hell!” “DONNY!!!!!”

### DONNY:
Why are you doing...

---

I don’t like that!

You sound like....

---

No no

---

You can’t be part of it 

---

[Recorded audience continues to heckle]

You’re supposed to help me!

---

You were supposed to be my angels 

---

You were…

No!!

---

I thought…

---

YOU!!!!!!!

---

No! NO!!

---

[Donny plays Giving Up, the sounds stop]

---

Ooo-ooo-ooo hey 

---

Giving up is hard to do

---

When you really love someone 

---

Giving up... so hard to do 

---

When you still depend upon 

---

Her warm and tender touch

---

Her kiss and….her caress

---

Oooooh that used to mean so much

---

And bring you happiness

---

Woooo ooooooooh

---

Giving up, so hard to do

---

I've tried

---

But it just ain't no use 

---

Giving up, so hard to do 

---

I said I've tried

---

But it just ain't no use

---

But my light of hope is burning dim

---

But

---

But deep in my heart I pray

---

That my love and faith in the girl

---

…will bring her back someday 

---

Hey hey hey hey…

---

[Music Break]

---

Whether

---

Whether she knows or not

---

She really needs me too 

---

The little girl is all I got 

---

Yes she is

---

And giving, is hard to do

---

Giving up

---

So hard to do 

---

[Knock at the door]

### ERIC (Recorded):
Hey Donny. You ok?

---

### Donny:
Heey... giving up 

---

So very hard to do 

---

I said I've tried

---

Hey, but I just can't get loose 

---

Giving up

---

So hard for me to do

---

I don't want to lose you

---

Cause you mean so much to me

---

[He continues to sing, getting more resolute]

[He takes a deep breath]
