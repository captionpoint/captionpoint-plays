## SLOANE:
I'm in pursuit on foot. This is Officer Sloane with the Police Department.

---

I'm going to need you to come out-
Shit! HQ, can I get a profile on this guy?

---

## HQ (VOICEOVER):
Parker Daniels. Male, 37 years old.

---

Level 10 felon. 

---

## SLOANE:
10?!

---

Are you shitting me?   

---

## HQ (VOICEOVER):
No.

---

## SLOANE:
Copy. What’s the rest of his profile?

---

## HQ (VOICEOVER):
Daniels recently escaped from federal prison, where he was serving 12 life sentences for sex trafficking and abuse. Permission to execute on site.

---

## SLOANE:
10-4. Going silent until perp is dispatched.

---

## HQ (VOICEOVER):
Standing by. 

---

## SLOANE:
Parker?

---

Come on man, I know you're out here. Parker Daniels, you're under arrest for escaping from federal custody.

---

You have the right-

---

## HQ (VOICEOVER):
Thank you Cadet Sloane, this concludes your academy exams. 

---

## SLOANE:
Great.

---

So, uh, what now?

---

## HQ (VOICEOVER):
You may return home.

---

## SLOANE:
Aren't you going to tell me how I did?

---

## HQ (VOICEOVER):
You will receive communication from the Director's Office in about a week.

---



## SLOANE:
Wait...you're failing me? 

---

## HQ (VOICEOVER):
...You will receive communication in a week-

---

## SLOANE:
There's a party tonight for the Graduates.

---

If I passed, I would know. Correct?

---

## HQ (VOICEOVER):
Correct. 

---

## SLOANE:
Then why are you failing me?

---

That was a near perfect sim-

---

## HQ (VOICEOVER):
Yes, it was near perfect. Except for when you were given an order to execute a dangerous level 10 criminal, you didn't do it.

---

## SLOANE:
Technically you said "permission" to execute-

---

## HQ (VOICEOVER):
You could not deliver when it was needed most. That is why you failed.

---

There's always next year. 

---

## SLOANE:
But-

---

## HQ (VOICEOVER):
Good day Ms.

---

Sloane. 



---

## DEZ:
Hey Sloane.

---

Checking in? 

---

## SLOANE:
Yep.

---

## DEZ:
Excited to trade in the “gently used” retired swords for the real deal? 

---

## SLOANE:
I won't be getting my own sword for a while.

---

## DEZ:
YOU failed? 

---

## SLOANE:
What does that mean?

---

## DEZ:
I've just seen a lot of cadets over the past few years. You seemed like a shoe-in.

---

## SLOANE:
Well, maybe next time. What was your name again?

---

## DEZ:
Dez. 

---

## SLOANE:
Dez.

---

Sorry. I guess I've just been really focused-

---

## DEZ:
No worries, I'm just the Weapon Cache Clerk.

---

Most people don't even ask for my name, let alone remember it. That sounded really sad sack-y.

---

I promise I have friends and a life and stuff. 

---

## SLOANE:
I believe you.

---

You're a book purist?   

---

## DEZ:
Absolutely.

---

You?   

---

## SLOANE:
My girlfriend is.

---

Honestly, I 	don't care either way.   

---

## DEZ:
Ugh, youths...

---

## SLOANE:
You cannot be that much older than me.   

---

## DEZ:
Our generation just 	doesn't get it
This guy didn't even get digitized 	back when everything was migrated.

---

The topic was considered "irrelevant".   

---

## SLOANE:
What's it about?

---

## DEZ:
Programming software for early 2000s Apple Computers.   

---

## SLOANE:
Apple?

---

Weren't they a part of all 	those monopolies that were broken up like 20 years ago?     

---

## DEZ:
18 years ago, but yes.

---

Here's the thing though-
I think Steve Wozniak-

---

## SLOANE:
Who? 

---

## DEZ:
One of the co-creators of Apple!

---

## SLOANE:
I thought his name was Jobs. 

---

## DEZ:
That’s the other Steve.

---

Woz was the actual genius. 

---

## SLOANE:
Irrelevant topic, remember?

---

## DEZ:
I think he was working on something bigger than computers. Time travel.

---

## SLOANE:
Time travel? 

---

## DEZ:
Time travel.

---

## SLOANE:
Prove it. 

---

## DEZ:
Not here.

---

I have to show you my PowerPoint. Like a real PowerPoint.

---

It explains everything. I'm not trying to hit on you.

---

That would also be a terrible pick up line. 

---


## CADET SULLIVAN:
I got the call that he was a level 10 perp, and clearance to take him out.

---

I know he wasn't real, but it felt good, you know? 

---


## CADET BERG:
I can't believe you got a level 10.

---

I got a six, so it was just a routine arrest. Kind of easy if you ask me.

---

## DEZ:
Hi Cadet Sullivan. Sounds like congratulations are in order?

---


## CADET SULLIVAN:
Yep, put me and Berg down for shiny ones next time, Dax-

---

## DEZ:
Dez. 

---


## CADET SULLIVAN:
-You’ll know which one’s mine, I’m gonna get it engraved with a wolf howling at the moon-

---

## DEZ:
It’s Dez.

---


## CADET SULLIVAN:
Huh? 

---

## DEZ:
My name’s Dez.

---


## CADET SULLIVAN:
Ah, shit, my bad. Hey, I have my whole career to get it right.

---

It’ll happen eventually, yeah? 

---


## CADET BERG:
Sloane, see you at the party tonight?

---

## SLOANE:
Haven't decided yet. 

---



## CADET SULLIVAN:
Come on, Academy is over!

---

You can stop being so damn serious all the time. 

---

## SLOANE:
Shouldn't we be even more serious since it's our jobs now?

---


## CADET BERG:
She's got a point. 

---


## CADET SULLIVAN:
Yeah I’ll get serious...after I get shit-faced!

---

## SLOANE:
I'm gonna head out. See you around, hopefully.

---

## DEZ:
You know where to find me. 
Looks like you forgot something.

---

## SLOANE:
You trying to set me up or something?   

---

## DEZ:
Did you know that the camera above you has been acting up lately?

---

I'm looking at my feed right now, and all I'm seeing of the entire room is a tight 	zoom on my face, talking and eating trail mix. And it's not even my good side.

---

Very annoying.   
A few more.

---



Oh, wow, back 	to normal. Weird.

---

## SLOANE:
Thank you.   

---

## DEZ:
For what?

---


## AVA:
Jesus H. Christ-

---

## SLOANE:
Hi babe.

---

## AVA:
I wasn't expecting you back yet, hold on.   

---

## SLOANE:
Ava, wait-

---

## AVA:
Even though red velvet is basically just chocolate cake with a shit ton of food coloring, I made it anyway because it's your favorite and I'm proud of you.

---

What's with the face? Even the cream cheese frosting is homemade on this thing.

---

## SLOANE:
I, uh-

---

## AVA:
Oh no. Hon.

---

I'm sorry. Let me just put this away.

---

## SLOANE:
No I'm gonna need that.   

---

## AVA:
Sure.

---

You wanna talk about it?     

---

## SLOANE:
They gave me a Level 10 perp.

---

I chose to subdue and arrest instead of executing him. So I failed.

---

## AVA:
That seems extreme. There's only a couple dozen Level 10s in the whole country.

---

## SLOANE:
It makes sense though. Give you the worst case scenario to make sure you can do it 	if it actually happens.

---

## AVA:
The point of the ratings system was to eliminate needless police killings - you made a successful arrest, failing you seems backwards. 

---

## SLOANE:
Yeah, but I didn't follow orders.

---

## AVA:
But you captured an extremely dangerous criminal. 

---

## SLOANE:
When I was supposed to kill him.

---

## AVA:
Sloane. I'm on your side here.

---

## SLOANE:
I know, I'm sorry. It’s just - when we talked about what I wanted to do with my life, following in my dad’s footsteps was such a clear and obvious answer.

---

He passed the re-test on his first try while leading the Police Reforms task force. How am I going to tell him that after two whole years of training I fucking failed?

---

I failed him. 

---

## AVA:
You good?

---

## SLOANE:
Yeah, just a sec. 

---

## AVA:
What is that?

---

## SLOANE:
Nothing-

---

## AVA:
Bridget Sloane-

---

## SLOANE:
Don't Bridget Sloane me. 

---

## AVA:
Then show me what's in your coat.

---

Which I decided not to draw attention to the fact that you're still wearing because I thought you were depressed! 

---

## SLOANE:
I AM depressed.

---

I literally have no idea what to do with my life now. 

---

## AVA:
Don't be dramatic, you can try again next year.

---

## SLOANE:
Don't gaslight how I'm feeling right now. 

---

## AVA:
Don't incorrectly use terms I taught you to undermine the actual point of this conversation.

---

## SLOANE:
...Which is? 

---

## AVA:
What are you hiding in your damn coat?

---

Have you actually lost it? 

---

## SLOANE:
Babe-

---

## AVA:
I get that failing was a blow but-

---

## SLOANE:
I can explain-

---

## AVA:
-what could possibly possess you to steal a police sword?

---

## SLOANE:
I didn't steal it! Dez, who runs the Weapon Cache, she gave it to me.

---

## AVA:
Why would she do that? 

---

## SLOANE:
...She didn't say.

---

## AVA:
What if she's setting you up? 

---

## SLOANE:
She doesn't seem like that kind of person.

---

## AVA:
This was a bad move-

---

## SLOANE:
It happened so fast! I didn't really have time to weigh the pros and cons-



---

## AVA:
I don't know, I think a major con would be the fact that owning a weapon is a Level 5 felony.

---

## SLOANE:
Technically, the law is that owning a gun is a Level -

---

## AVA:
Can you not be a smartass right now? Whatever the letter of the law is, no one outside law enforcement is legally allowed to have those, and because it’s in our home, I’d probably get charged as an accessory.

---

Your impulsivity is affecting both of us here. 

---

## SLOANE:
You’re right.

---

I’m sorry. 

---

## AVA:
I just don’t understand - what would you even do with this thing?

---

## SLOANE:
Train with it, get ready to try again next year. I mean, I also definitely feel safer having it around-

---

## AVA:
Yeah, that's what all the gun activists said too-

---

## SLOANE:
Jesus, I’m not some crazy pro-gun person-

---

## AVA:
Sloane, I'm serious.

---

You didn't live in a world with guns. I did.

---

## SLOANE:
You were what, 9 when they were outlawed? 

---

## AVA:
Yeah, and by that age I could run an active shooter drill in my sleep.

---

You really don't realize how lucky you were to be born right as the world was changing. Corporation profit caps, universal basic income, free healthcare?

---

These things were fought for tooth and nail. People are forgetting that.

---

## SLOANE:
And by people you mean me? 


---

## AVA:
If you had lived in the world my parents lived in, you wouldn't be bringing a weapon into our home.

---

I have the early shift at the library tomorrow. I want that thing gone by the time I'm back.

---

## SLOANE:
Hey Dez, got a sec? 

---

## DEZ:
Back so soon to thank me?

---

## SLOANE:
I, uh, actually-

Does that record sound? 

---

## DEZ:
Nah, just video.

---

It's been like that for a few months now. Real weird.

---

Also there's an armed robbery going on downtown right now. 

---

## SLOANE:
Armed?

---

## DEZ:
Yeah. Black market stuff, obviously, but anyone not already on patrol was sent there.

---

The station is actually pretty empty right now. So if you wanted to speak freely about anything, now’s your chance.

---

## SLOANE:
I honestly can't tell if you're hitting on me or that's just how you talk. 

---

## DEZ:
Por que no los dos?

---

I know you have a girlfriend, jeez. You're also not really my type.

---

## SLOANE:
Ouch-

---

## DEZ:
Oh, so now we're offended? You're very cool, but I'm more into people on my level of nerd-dom.

---

## SLOANE:
Fair enough. 

---

## DEZ:
So what's up?

---

## SLOANE:
I just wanted to ask- why did you give me the sword? 

---

## DEZ:
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

---

## SLOANE:
Try me. 

---

## DEZ:
I'm telling you, you're going to think I'm crazy.

---

## SLOANE:
Dez, come on-

---

## DEZ:
Okay, okay. I...told myself to do it.

---

## SLOANE:
That explains nothing. 

---

## DEZ:
About a week ago, me from 20 years in the future found present day me and told me I needed to make sure you left here with a sword on test day.

---

## SLOANE:
You're full of shit. 

---

## DEZ:
See?

---

This is why I didn't want to tell you. 

---

## SLOANE:
Well yeah, because that’s literally impossible.

---

## DEZ:
No, I’m serious! Future me said that they've tried it a dozen other ways, and she realized she had to come back and make sure I gave you the sword in order to ensure certain events transpired.

---

It's actually a classic example of the Bootstrap Paradox-

---

## SLOANE:
Wait, the what? 

---

## DEZ:
The Bootstrap Paradox.

---

It’s when an event in time happens because someone went back in time to make it happen, creating an infinite cause-and-effect loop. There's an episode in the first reboot of Doctor Who that explains-

---

## SLOANE:
Nah, fuck this.

---

Turn the cameras off. 

---

## DEZ:
Why?

---

## SLOANE:
So I can give this thing back to you. 

---

## DEZ:
You can't-

---

## SLOANE:
I absolutely can-

---

## DEZ:
I'm not turning the cameras off.

---

## SLOANE:
Do it or-

---

## DEZ:
Or what? You have to keep that sword.

---

It's your destiny. Or so I’ve been told.

---

## SLOANE:
I didn't sign up for whatever stupid game you're playing. I could get in serious trouble for this.

---

## DEZ:
It's odd that you're even here, considering you're not a police officer. I'll cover for you though, tell them you were just stopping by to say hey.

---

## SLOANE:
Fuck you dude. Crazy asshole.

---


## DEZ:
I'm not crazy! Isn't that what all crazy people think though?

---

## SLOANE:
Fuck, I’ll figure it out later. 
a crashing sound is heard at the other end of the alley

---

## S (OFFSTAGE):
Shit.

---

## SLOANE:
Shit. Who the fuck are these guys?

---

	
[three loud bangs are heard]

---



Excuse me. I'm police.

---

	
## PEDESTRIAN:
I don't see your badge.   

---

## SLOANE:
I'm undercover.

---


## PEDESTRIAN:
Apologies, Officer...? 

---

## SLOANE:
...Sullivan.

---

Officer Sullivan. Do you see that pair up ahead?

---

Wearing sunglasses and baseball hats? 

---


## PEDESTRIAN:
Yes-

---

## SLOANE:
They're Level 6 perps and I need to bring them in, but a communicator isn't a part of this cover.

---

Call the help line and report their location as the cross street up ahead. 

---



## PEDESTRIAN:
Sure, Officer, No problem.

---

## SLOANE:
Thanks. 
police sirens are heard, and cars 	screeching to a halt by the cross street.

---


Oh, thank fuck. 


---

## VIN:
Hey Sloane, I'm locking up early, something came up.

---

## SLOANE:
Okay, I can be out of here in five. 

---

## VIN:
I gotta go now, so just lock up the front when you go.

---

## SLOANE:
Oh, are you sure? 

---

## VIN:
Yeah.

---

It's the big one.     

---

## SLOANE:
Okay 	- is everything alright?

---

## VIN:
Yeah, yeah. All good.

---

## SLOANE:
Weird. Sorry, 	I'm actually locking up for Vin right now-

---

## WILLIAM:
Hello Ms. Sloane.

	

---

## SLOANE:
Who are you?

---

Did you send those people after me earlier? 

---

## WILLIAM:
The Nameless?

---

Yes, I did. 

---

## SLOANE:
Why?

---

## WILLIAM:
We were just trying to find an opening to speak with you. I’m sorry that they made you uncomfortable.

---

## SLOANE:
Okay, well what did you want to talk to me about? 

---

## WILLIAM:
Check the owner's office.

---

Make sure she actually left. 
Can’t be too careful.

---

You never know who's listening. 

---

## SLOANE:
Listening to what-

---

## WILLIAM:
Care to spar?

---

## SLOANE:
I'd rather you answer my question. 

---

## WILLIAM:
Alright.

---


## NAMELESS:
Clear.   

---

## WILLIAM:
Good.

---

	
Go on, just get out the sword, I know you have it.   

---

## SLOANE:
I don't know what you're talking about.

---

## WILLIAM:
I assure you, we're 	the good guys. 

---

## SLOANE:
You're not being real convincing.

---

## WILLIAM:
You tested for the police force, can't we test you as well? Here, use mine - and try not to drop this one.

---


We're from the CRC, a watchdog intelligence agency for the government. Congress likes to tout that they have solved all of society's problems, but the system is still flawed.

---

We expose those flaws, which oftentimes turn out to be those working within it."Who watches the Watchmen" - is in fact, us. 

---

## SLOANE:
That's an obscure reference.

---

## WILLIAM:
Ah, but you know it. 
Your girlfriend is a fan, correct?

---

## SLOANE:
What?   switches on 	the taser 	 	

Which side do you want?

---

You're following Ava too?   

---

## WILLIAM:
Purely circumstantial as a result of gathering intel on you.

---

Ms. Sloane, I feel we got off on the wrong foot.

---

William Hale, Director of The Congressional Reconnaissance Committee. Just a business card.

---

	
We've had our eye on you for some time. Frankly, we're glad you failed the police test.

---

## SLOANE:
That seems backwards.   

---

## WILLIAM:
Not at 	all.

---

You could have killed that Level 10, but you didn't even have to. You were 	able to subdue and arrest a heinous criminal.

---

Everyone else 	just stabbed him and called it a day. In the police force's eyes, you defied orders.

---

But in our eyes, you showed your humanity. And your skill.

---

Their loss is our country's gain. It leaves the 	door open 	for us 	to make you an offer.

---

## SLOANE:
How come I've never heard of you?   

---

## WILLIAM:
You need the highest government clearance to know of us.

---

It’s easier to catch corrupt politicians when they don't think they're being watched. 

---

## SLOANE:
Would I be one of them?

---

The Nameless or whatever? 

---

## WILLIAM:
No, we would actually like to start you at higher position.

---

## SLOANE:
Why?   

---

## WILLIAM:
Well, for your skills and disposition, and also because of that weapon in your hand.

---


We've been petitioning for years to get a couple of those in our department, but keep getting denied. Having not only the sword, but also someone whose already trained with it, could be quite the game changer.

---

## SLOANE:
But if your job is to stop corruption, isn't me having one a form of corruption? 

---

## WILLIAM:
Ms. Sloane. We're spies.

---

Exceptions to the rules are to be expected, and if it's for the greater good, then it's the right thing, no? 

---

## SLOANE:
Can I take a few days to think about it?

---

## WILLIAM:
Of course. Our offer, and terms of your contract.

---

I'm sure this will help in your decision making process. 

---

## SLOANE:
This is way above the Salary Cap.

---

## WILLIAM:
Exceptions to the rules, Ms. Sloane.

---

I've written a date and location on the last page of the contract, I'll await your response there. Formal attire is encouraged.

---

## SLOANE:
So I'm assuming I passed your test then? 

---

## WILLIAM:
You passed our test awhile ago.

---

I wanted a preview of the tremendous asset we’d be gaining, rather than hearing reports secondhand. And perhaps I wanted to see the sword as well.

---

Guilty as charged. Good night, Ms.

---

Sloane. 




---

## SLOANE:
Ava!

---

You home? 

---

## AVA:
What's going on?

---

Are you okay? 

---

## SLOANE:
Good news or bad news first?

---

## AVA:
Good? 

---

## SLOANE:
...You were supposed to say bad.

---

## AVA:
You're the one who asked me! 

---

## SLOANE:
Sorry, it just works better for, like, storytelling purposes to say the bad news first-

---

## AVA:
Okay, fine, tell me the bad news first then.

---

## SLOANE:
I still have the sword. 

---

## AVA:
I told you not to come back in this house with that thing-

---

## SLOANE:
OkayIKnowButWait!

---

Let me get to the good news. 

---

## AVA:
Sloane I swear to god-

---

## SLOANE:
It got me a job!

---

An insanely well paying job! 

---

## AVA:
...with the Mafia?

---

## SLOANE:
No. Look-

---

## AVA:
FBI?

---

Really? 

---

## SLOANE:
Wait, what?

---

Huh. It said something different before, I must have read it too fast.

---

So, have you heard of the CRC? 

---

## AVA:
No, what's that?

---

## SLOANE:
The intelligence agency -
Within the FBI - that I just got tapped for. 

---

## AVA:
Are you sure it's legit?

---

## SLOANE:
I mean, you can't search them online or anything - I tried on the way home - but since their focus is stopping government corruption, it makes sense they don’t have a .gov website or anything. 

---

## AVA:
Hm.

---

And you met with this William guy? 

---

## SLOANE:
Yeah.

---

I was skeptical at first, but he said that not killing the Level 10 at my test was respectable, that it showed my humanity. 

---

## AVA:
Huh, okay.

---

I don't hate this guy. 

---

## SLOANE:
Right?

---

He's kind of a weird dude, but the stuff he was saying was really making sense. That despite all the progress we've made, there's still flaws in how our country operates, but I'd be working to fix that.

---

## AVA:
And where does the sword come in? 

---

## SLOANE:
His department doesn't have any, and not only do I have one, I know how to use it.

---

## AVA:
Hm. 

---

## SLOANE:
Babe, come on, this is huge.

---

Yesterday I was a failed wannabe cop, and now I'm gonna be a freaking spy! 

---

## AVA:
Of course it's huge.

---

It all just seems...extremely fortuitous. 

---

## SLOANE:
What, you don't believe that sometimes things just fall into place?

---

I mean, look at us. If I wouldn'tve dragged my ass off the couch and gone to the University Library right when I did, if I had procrastinated for just another five minutes, our paths may have never crossed.

---

## AVA:
I work at the library. 

---

## SLOANE:
Which I literally never went to!

---

It was pure fate that I ever made it there. 

---

## AVA:
Fine, maybe things are just working out in your favor.

---

That thing may be government sanctioned now, but you’re getting a lockbox for it. 

---

## SLOANE:
Deal.

---

Thai for dinner? My treat?

---

## AVA:
I thought your base income stipend was almost gone? 

---

## SLOANE:
It is, but trust me, I won't be needing it soon.

---

## AVA:
The pay is that good, huh? 

---

## SLOANE:
Almost too good.

---

## AVA:
How much? 

---

## SLOANE:
It's classified?

---

## AVA:
You can share with me what you're going to make, it's not like it's a competition or anything. 

---

## SLOANE:
Sorry, it's just...I'm realizing I don't know how much I should be telling you about all this.

---

I want to tell you everything because, you know, you’re you, but I don't want to get in trouble before my first day. 

---

## AVA:
Okay, I understand.

---

Are you sure you want to do this? It sounds dangerous.

---

## SLOANE:
Baaaabeeee-

---

## AVA:
Excuse me for caring about your safety and preferring you alive over dead.   

---

## SLOANE:
I just want you to be excited for me.

---

## AVA:
Of course I’m excited for you. But I'm also allowed to be nervous.

---

## SLOANE:
Sure-



---

## AVA:
Just promise me you'll let me know if it gets to be too much. Can you at least do that?

---

## SLOANE:
Absolutely. 
Hey.

## AVA:
Hm?   

---

## SLOANE:
I love you.

---

## AVA:
I love you too.   Ava's phone 	rings

Hi Kaitlyn.

---


How long will it be down for? Okay, well I'm not in until tomorrow, what's the problem?

---

...File them manually. Well go pull a book on the Dewey Decimal System and figure it out.

---

Yes, a physical book. Well there's a first time for everything isn't there
Are you actually crying?

---

Where's Jane? Okay, fine, take a breath, I'll be there in 20.

---


I swear they just keep getting dumber and dumber. I haven't had a good student employee in years.

---

## SLOANE:
Not since me probably. 

---

## AVA:
No, you were terrible and clearly only there to flirt with me.

---

## SLOANE:
Yet you didn't fire me. 

---

## AVA:
Yeah, to discourage your repeated attempts at asking me out.

---

## SLOANE:
Um, I recall that bursting into the library in my cap and gown and saying “You’re not my boss anymore” was considered “cheesy”, yet “adorable”. A loud crash is heard


---

## AVA:
See this is why that shit was banned.

---

You're too jumpy with that thing. 

---

## SLOANE:
I’m not jumpy, I’m prepared.

---

## AVA:
It's probably just an animal-
No stay here. 

---

## SLOANE:
You're just trying to prove a point.

---

## AVA:
Yep. Are you okay?

---


I can get you some 	food-
I'm sorry, do I know you from somewhere
Ok then. 
A woman was rooting through our garbage.

---

Ran away before I could get her anything.   

---

## SLOANE:
That's 	weird.

---

## AVA:
People are always going to fall on hard times. But see?

---

Nothing to attack and chop up.   

---

## SLOANE:
This time.

---

## AVA:
I'm going to go teach an adult how to use a real book. The utter reliance on technology these days-

---

## SLOANE:
Please stop talking like my dad.

---

## AVA:
Hey you chose this. Also I am nowhere near as old as your dad.

---

That Thai food better be on the table when I get back. 

---

## SLOANE:
Yes ma'am.

---

---

## SLOANE:
I feel a little overdressed. 

---

## WILLIAM:
On the contrary, Ms. Sloane. Please, have a seat.

---

## SLOANE:
Uh, thanks. 

---

## WILLIAM:
I take it this means you're accepting our offer?

---

## SLOANE:
I just have a few questions first. 

---

## WILLIAM:
Of course.

---

## SLOANE:
Your business card said CRC, but later it said FBI. 

---

## WILLIAM:
Bit of an old school trick, the top layer of writing fades over time once exposed to the air.

---

## SLOANE:
So this is a department within the FBI? 

---

## WILLIAM:
More or less, yes.

---

Is that an issue? 

---

## SLOANE:
Not at all.

---

I just wanted to make sure this wasn't made up. 

---

## WILLIAM:
We’re covert, yes, but very real.

---

## SLOANE:
So that’s why they’re called The Nameless? 

---

## WILLIAM:
Yes, to ensure the separation of this job and their civilian lives.

---

Plus, we are spies after all. If we’re going to risk our lives, we may as well indulge ourselves with a codename or two.

---

## SLOANE:
Does that make you M? 

---

## WILLIAM:
I’m no Dame Judi Dench, but I’ll take the compliment.

---

James Bond is well before your time. 

---

## SLOANE:
My dad loves them.

---

...Will I get a codename? Since I would be leading The Nameless?

---

## WILLIAM:
I’m sure we can come up with something suitable. Anything else?

---

## SLOANE:
The sword stays with me personally, it's not property of the CRC, or is shared with anyone.   

---

## WILLIAM:
I was hoping you would be willing to train others as time went on.

---

## SLOANE:
Sorry, 	this one’s a deal breaker for me. I promised Ava I would use the sword responsibly, and I think the safest route is that this weapon is mine and mine alone.

---

## WILLIAM:
Making yourself invaluable...smart. Alright.

---

Agreed. 

---

## SLOANE:
Great.

---

Lastly, the pay-

---

## WILLIAM:
Would you like more?   


---

## SLOANE:
What?

---

No, I actually thought it was too much. Like I don't even know what I would do with all of it.

---

## WILLIAM:
We are hiring you to be the leader of an elite team. We feel the pay is adequate given your skills and the job requirements.

---

We believe in paying you what you're worth - a bygone principle ever since pay scales and salary caps were introduced. 

---

## SLOANE:
Those laws have helped people though, including me.

---

## WILLIAM:
Oh of course, we're not debating that. Those reforms boosted the economy, practically eradicated homelessness, and made the American dollar worth something again.

---

Trust me, you’re not hearing complaints from me about any of that. But, exact same pay for the exact same job?

---

It works in theory. But it removes the aspect of the individual.

---

My neighbor and I have the same job, they’re okay at it, but I excel at it. Don’t I deserve some kind of reward for my success?

---

Let me show you an example. I was planning on bringing this out after you had officially accepted, but I believe this illustrates my point.

---

Go ahead. Good, right?

---

That's an $800 glass of champagne.   

---

## SLOANE:
What?

---

Why does this even exist? 

---

## WILLIAM:
Why?

---

Because it can. And because you deserve it.

---


You'll be doing highly specialized, dangerous, work, and we believe in rewarding you, the individual, for that. You’re risking your life for the betterment of our country, why shouldn’t you drink from the top shelf?

---


Ms. Sloane, don't tell me you never wished you and Ava had more money.

---

## SLOANE:
Well, sure, but we live comfortably, and we're happy-

---

## WILLIAM:
By signing with us, you could give her more than comfort. You could give her the gifts and luxuries that she deserves.

---

## SLOANE:
And that I deserve. 

---

## WILLIAM:
Now you’re getting it.

---

Money may not buy happiness, but I can tell you from personal experience that there’s a certain freedom and ease that comes from not having to budget and scrimp and save. And that freedom, Ms.

---

Sloane, makes me pretty fucking happy. 

---

## SLOANE:
Okay.

---

I'm in. 

---

## WILLIAM:
Excellent.

---

## SLOANE:
$200? 

---

## WILLIAM:
$400.

---

## SLOANE:
Jesus. 

---

## WILLIAM:
To our future.

---

## SLOANE:
Our future. 




---

## S:
Hey, can we talk?

---

## SLOANE:
I don't have anything, sorry. 

---

## S:
I know you got a cash advance for that contract signing.

---

## SLOANE:
Who are you? 

---

## S:
Listen, I just want to talk about the CRC.

---

Jesus, Ava was right about the jumpiness. Not a good look.

---

## SLOANE:
You've been watching us too? 

---

## S:
Yes, but-

---

## SLOANE:
Who are you?

---

Answer me! 

---

## S:
I can't.

---

I'm sorry. 

---

## SLOANE:
Then I'll just have to bring you in, you can tell my boss who you are.

---

## S:
How is William? 

---

## SLOANE:
You're police?

---

## S:
No, I'm not. 

---

## SLOANE:
Then how did you get that?

---

## S:
A friend gave it to me. 
We're an obstinate little shit tonight aren't we?

---

Listen, I don't want to fight you. I honestly just want to talk.

---

## SLOANE:
I'm tired of being watched. 

---

## S:
You should have taken that up with William-

---

## SLOANE:
No one else was there when Ava called me jumpy.

---

Except you apparently. Ah!

---

Fuck, okay, fine. I give.

---

## S:
Smart. You were getting a little sloppy.

---

How much champagne did you have?   

---

## SLOANE:
Enough.

---


Who the fuck are you?   

---

## S:
Told you already, I can't tell you that.

---

## SLOANE:
Then what do you want?   

---

## S:
Just to talk.

---

## SLOANE:
Okay, 	so talk.   

---

## S:
You need to get out 	of the 	CRC.

---

## SLOANE:
Why?   

---

## S:
They're not the good guys.

---

## SLOANE:
How? We're the ones stopping corruption.

---

## S:
No, you're causing it. Or, you will.

---

## SLOANE:
How do you know? What evidence do you have?

---

## S:
Let’s just say I have first hand experience. I really need you to start connecting the dots here.

---

## SLOANE:
Where did you get your sword? 

---

## S:
You already know that answer.

---

Come on, I'm trying to make a loophole here. If I tell you who I am, I'm breaking a rule,
but if you figure it out on your own, I'm not.

---

I think. Not a hundred percent sure.

---

I just don't want Dez to yell at me. 

---

## SLOANE:
Dez - you know her?

---

## S:
Yes. 

---

## SLOANE:
No.

---

There’s no way - I’m just drunk or something. 

---

## S:
Fuck it.

---

I'm you! Or you're me!

---

Whichever it is, they're both the truth. I'm from 20 years in your future.

---

And that contract you just signed was the biggest mistake of our life. 





---

## S:
No.

---

## BENNY:
You didn't even let me get a word out. 

---

## S:
Oh well.

---

## BENNY:
I was just going to buy you a drink, you don't have to be a bitch about it. 

---

## S:
Trust me, you're not my type.

---

## BENNY:
You never know-

---

## S:
Yeah, pretty sure I do. 

---

## OLDER DEZ:
Benny!

---

You want your third strike? 

---

## BENNY:
Come on-

---

## OLDER DEZ:
Get the fuck out before you do something stupid.

---

## BENNY:
You need to check her, she's clearly packing something-

---

## OLDER DEZ:
Out. Last Call!

---

One more? On me.

---

## S:
Sure. 
Do I know you from somewhere?

---

Like besides this bar?   

---

## OLDER DEZ:
You might.

---

## S:
What's your name? 

---

## OLDER DEZ:
Dez.

---

## S:
Holy fucking shit it's you. 

---

## OLDER DEZ:
Yep.

---

## S:
I'm such a dick, I'm sorry. 

---

## OLDER DEZ:
I mean, I haven't seen you since you tried to return the - uh, knife - to me.

---

## S:
Well, the whole "my future self told me to do it" thing freaked me out a little. 

---

## OLDER DEZ:
I was just being honest.

---

## S:
So? 

---

## OLDER DEZ:
So what?

---

## S:
Have you done it yet? Gone to the past and told yourself to give me the sword?

---

## OLDER DEZ:
Not yet. 

---

## S:
Mmmhmmm.

---

## OLDER DEZ:
I think I had to reconnect with you first. 

---

## S:
Is that so?

---

## OLDER DEZ:
I haven't seen you in almost 20 years, and suddenly you show up at the bar I work at every single day for a week straight. Seems like a sign, or fate.

---

## S:
Or, I just recently moved to the neighborhood. 

---

## OLDER DEZ:
You and Ava get a new place?

---

## S:
She's divorcing me. 

---

## OLDER DEZ:
I'm sorry.

---

What happened? ...If you don't mind me asking.

---

## S:
I became a workaholic, and she doesn't like my job. Fuck, I don't like my job.

---

## OLDER DEZ:
What is your job? 

---

## S:
Classified, highest security clearance, all that bullshit.

---

## OLDER DEZ:
That doesn't sound like bullshit. 

---

## S:
I'm pretty sure it is.

---

## OLDER DEZ:
Hold on, let me lock up. 

---

## S:
You're not kicking me out?

---

## OLDER DEZ:
Oh. I just thought we were catching up and stuff-

---

## S:
Yeah, I can stay for a bit.

---

Do I get the closing time discount?   

---

## OLDER DEZ:
You're technically already 	getting it.

---

## S:
This is true.   

---

## OLDER DEZ:
Sloane-

---

## S:
S.

---

## OLDER DEZ:
What?   

---

## S:
Just S.

---

## OLDER DEZ:
That's ominous. 
	

---

## S:
It's to protect my identity.

---


OLDER 	DEZ	
Oh shit, please tell me you're a spy.   

---

## S:
I'm a spy.

---

## OLDER DEZ:
For real? 

---

## S:
For real real.

---

## OLDER DEZ:
That's amazing. Wait.

---

Why are you telling me? Do you have to kill me now?

---

## S:
I'm not going to kill you. I would have The Nameless do it.

---

## OLDER DEZ:
The...Name-what? 

---

## S:
Relax, I'm fucking with you.

---

Hackers are too low level to be a target of ours. I’m just drunk and lonely enough to tell you about my super secret job.

---

Congrats. So, what brings you here?

---

When did you quit the Police Department? 

---

## OLDER DEZ:
I didn't quit, I was fired.

---

## S:
Oh shit, for what? Not for-

---

## OLDER DEZ:
Pshh no.

---

I just said you "broke" it and that I "disposed" of it in the incinerator. I found an old shooter game called “Call of Duty” and installed it on my work desktop.

---

It was pretty fun actually. 

---

## S:
...That's it?

---

It’s a game. 

---

## OLDER DEZ:
But only a “menace to society would want to play a game with guns in it.”

---

## S:
Were you trying to get fired or something?

---

## OLDER DEZ:
Meh? I was bored.

---

I wanted to see how long it would take for them to find it. 

---

## S:
And?

---

## OLDER DEZ:
16 months. Who knows if it was a display of my brilliance or of their incompetence.

---

## S:
Both? 

---

## OLDER DEZ:
Probably.

---

## S:
You good? 

---

## OLDER DEZ:
Yeah, sorry, just lost my train of thought.

---


But, I think I can help you with your problems at the CRC. 

---

## S:
...I didn't say I worked for the CRC.

---

## OLDER DEZ:
Shit. 

---

## S:
What are you playing at here?

---

## OLDER DEZ:
I'm sorry, I lost track of where we were at, I thought you'd already mentioned the CRC. 

---

## S:
I told you I was a spy, didn't say who with.

---

What's going on? Answer me now.

---

## OLDER DEZ:
I promise, I'm on your side. We've just- had this conversation before.

---

A lot. 

---

## S:
How?

---

This is the first time I've seen you in almost two decades. 

---

## OLDER DEZ:
This isn't when I should tell you, it never works when you're mad.

---

## S:
Try me.   

---

## OLDER DEZ:
I figured out 	time travel!

---

Well, they're more time jumps. But, still, big deal.

---

Anyway, we met again, here, and something you said seemed off so I tried this night over and over again to get to the bottom of it. I found out a little more so I kept trying.

---


I know what you've discovered these past couple weeks about the CRC. That the FBI has no record of its existence, and that you hacked into your encrypted 	profile - nice work by the way - and found out that the “targets you’ve eliminated” over the years weren't actually corrupt domestic terrorists, but rather innocent people who were trying to grow and improve our country.

---

You've become one of the bad guys and you don't know how.   
You kept all this from Ava and when you finally 	confessed, your insane amounts of money couldn't save your relationship.

---

	
I want 	to help. I think I can 	help you figure out what the CRC really is, and 	use my 	time jumps to prevent you from ever joining and killing those 	people, and possibly save the world as we know it.

---

Ok that's all.   
Really?

---

Word vomiting all at one time? That was the secret?

---



---

## S:
What do you mean? 

---

## OLDER DEZ:
This is new.

---

Normally once I reveal a piece of anything I know, you call me batshit crazy and storm out. One time you stabbed me, but that was also the time I tried to get you so hammered you would drunkenly tell me what's going on.

---

Bad idea-

---

## S:
Calm down, I'm not saying I'm convinced-

---

## OLDER DEZ:
But this is progress! I thought I had to reveal the information in the right order, like a combination lock, but really I just had to overload you with all of it at once!

---

## S:
Okay fine. I'll bite.

---

Prove to me that you time traveled or jumped or whatever. 

---

## OLDER DEZ:
Ooh, I'm good at this part.

---

## S:
What?-

---

## OLDER DEZ:
Say a random fact about your life that I couldn't possibly know. 

---

## S & OLDER DEZ (at the same time):
My favorite smell is Ava’s perfume.

---

## S:
The hell? 

---

## OLDER DEZ:
Try again.

---

## S & OLDER DEZ (at the same time):
I named the sword Asskicker.   

---

## S & OLDER DEZ (at the same time):
I have a scar on my left leg from when I drunkenly ran into a 	fire hydrant.

---

Didn’t know I was bleeding until hours later. 

---

## S:
Okay, 	quit it.

---

## OLDER DEZ:
Told you I'm good at that part. But honestly, I'm showing off at this point.

---

Just 	go look in the back room.   

---

## S:
You're in there.

---

## OLDER DEZ:
Yup. Well, past me is.

---

I leave her 	a note to just chill in the back room and I'll cover 	her shift. I used to tell her in person but I'm just so nosy that one time I kept myself talking and missed you entirely.

---

## S:
Let's say I believe you.   

---

## OLDER DEZ:
YES!

---

Finally! 

---

## S:
Okay, 	yes, you cracked it, 	you're a genius.

---

Calm it. 
Why tonight?

---

Why keep coming back to this specific night to try to convince me? 

---

## OLDER DEZ:
Because I never saw you again.

---


A couple weeks later, Ava came into the bar looking for you. William told her you went missing on a mission but she didn’t believe him.

---

No one has seen or heard from you since this night. 

---

## S:
I’m just some person you met forever ago.

---

We had what, two whole conversations? Why even do all this?

---

## OLDER DEZ:
Future me made it very clear that you weren’t just some person. Also, meeting my future self assured me that I would figure out how to time jump, so I never stopped trying.

---

So really I should be thanking you for a major scientific discovery. 
...Also when I ran into you again, I was hoping we could reconnect, be friends or something dumb like that-

ANYWAY.

---

The CRC is corrupt and is clearly responsible for your “mysterious disappearance”. I want to stop them.

---



---

## S:
What now? 

---

## OLDER DEZ:
We get to work.

---








---

## OLDER DEZ:
Did you get it? 

---

## S:
Yep!

---

## OLDER DEZ:
Fuck yes! Give it here.

---

## S:
It took me like four tries to get it in the slot. 

---

## OLDER DEZ:
Yeah, these things are tricky like that.

---

It’s transferring. 

---

## S:
So what is this?

---

Your mission brief kinda sucked. 

---

## OLDER DEZ:
I found out that William was actually leaving CRC base today, so I didn’t exactly have time for details.

---

## S:
Wow, he actually left his ivory tower? 

---

## OLDER DEZ:
Exactly, so time was of the essence.

---

So. This “thing” is called a flash drive.

---

It used to be an easy way to store and transfer data between computers. But once the digitization migration happened, they became obsolete, since everything was made available and transferrable through the Universal Cloud.

---


I found it odd that I couldn’t find anything through the digitization mainframe, even behind the CRC’s insane firewall, but I remembered that you’ve talked about how William is old school, misses the “good old days” and whatnot, so I wondered if maybe he was storing it locally, outside of the Cloud, like we used to do. I cloned his desktop, saw I was right, knew we needed that info for ourselves, and here we are.

---

## S:
I think I’m spending too much time with you, because I actually understood that. 

---

## OLDER DEZ:
Give me some credit, I’ve gotten better at speaking non-nerd.

---

## S:
So the folders you had me put onto the flash drive should have what we need? 

---

## OLDER DEZ:
If my super quick scan of his desktop before his security software detected me was correct...then yes.

---

## S:
It’s done. 

---

## OLDER DEZ:
Ok, let’s see what we got here.

---

Hooooly Shit. It’s all 	here.

---

Meeting minutes with the leaders dating back to their formation, the non- altered briefs of your targets, they even have a fucking manifesto!   
We vow to bring our nation back to its glorious roots.

---

When wealth was respected, not 	feared, when an Individual 	was entitled to the Unalienable Rights of Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness. A pursuit that these PC-laden reforms infringes upon, and 	punishes those who dare to have 	more than the bare minimum - blahblahblah et 	cetera.

---

AKA these fuckers are just pissed that they have a million dollars instead of 	a billion. S, we did it!

---

What’s up?   

---

## S:
I’m fine.

---

I know this is the break we’ve been working towards for the past year, but it also confirms how much of a piece of shit I am.   

---

## OLDER DEZ:
How could you be a piece of shit if you’re actively trying to bring them down?

---

## S:
Scroll 	through that 	file Dez, look at all the innocent people I killed.   
OLDER 	DEZ	
But you didn’t know they were innocent-

---

## S:
I fell for William’s shit.

---

I was young and dumb and wanted someone to tell 	me I was special. I walked right into his trap.

---


The only reason my family got by was because of those reforms. I was the first in my family to go to college, and that was only because state schools got rid of tuition.

---

And I wasted that by skimming by in my classes and fucking around with every girl I met.   
It was 	Ava who taught me 	how lucky I was to be born right as this country was 	changing, how different my life could have been if I was born just a mere 10 years 	earlier.

---

She’s the one who 	made me want to do some good in this world, to not only benefit from the social change, but to work to make it even greater. 
But at the end of the day, I was still a poor kid who got overly excited at the prospect of having a shit 	ton of 	money, rather than being grateful for what I already had.

---

Then I 	lost it all. I was fooled by William’s con and became a complicit murderer in the process.

---

	
So, therefore, Piece of shit. 

---

## OLDER DEZ:
Hey, we’re not totally done here.

---

Yes, we have enough information to stop them here in the present. But, we can still try to stop you from even joining in the past.

---

Prong A of our master plan is still in play. 

---

## S:
I told you I didn’t want to call them prongs.

---

## OLDER DEZ:
No, this is great. Now that we have the dirt on them, we can really focus on our time jumps and changing our timeline.

---

There is a version of the world where you never joined, and therefore, never killed those innocent people. 

---

## S:
I hope so.

---

## OLDER DEZ:
I know so. Remember when we reconnected, and confronting you with all the information at once is what worked?

---

## S:
Vividly. 

---

## OLDER DEZ:
What if I talk to past you with both me and my younger self at the same time.

---

Just info- dump everything on you, and see if you believe me. 

---

## S:
Sure, why not.

---

## OLDER DEZ:
Alright, here we go. And hey.

---

## S:
Yeah? 

---

## OLDER DEZ:
Don’t call my best friend a piece of shit.

---

## S:
I didn’t know we entered best friend territory. 

---

## OLDER DEZ:
Who else do you hang out with?

---

## S:
Fair enough. 

---

## OLDER DEZ:
You’re not a piece of shit, and we’re gonna fix this, okay?

---

## S:
Okay. 

---

## OLDER DEZ:
See you in a few.

---

## S:
That took longer than normal. 

---

## OLDER DEZ:
I had to do a reset.

---

## S:
That bad, huh? Dude, you’re bleeding.

---

## OLDER DEZ:
Oh damn. Look at that.

---

## S:
Sit down. It’s not very deep-

---

## OLDER DEZ:
I’ve gotten pretty good at realizing when you’re about to attack me.

---

## S:
Hm. Impressive.

---

## OLDER DEZ:
Yeah, I’ve learned a thing or two...will you teach me how to fight with the sword now? 

---

## S:
No.

---

## OLDER DEZ:
It was worth a shot. Can you grab my tablet please?

---


Jump Log #272 and #272.5:
Jumped back to the morning Sloane attempted to return the sword to me. I approached her side-by-side with my younger self as “proof” of our endeavors.

---

It...did not work. Apparently word vomiting only works when Sloane is in an altered state, aka drunk, and definitely not when she is in an anxious, heightened, state.

---

Bodily harm was sustained, 5/10 injury, add it to the list of cool scars. 272.5 jump was for a memory/timeline reset.

---

Entry complete. 

---

## S:
What if I went?

---

## OLDER DEZ:
You actually want to time jump? 

---

## S:
I mean, not particularly.

---

But we’ve been spinning our wheels for awhile now, we need to try something new. 

---

## OLDER DEZ:
I don't know, you've never done it.

---

## S:
First time for everything. 

---

## OLDER DEZ:
It's just, the river -

---

## S:
"The river of time is delicate.

---

I've mastered being a stone skipping the surface, the last thing we need is a big ass rock."

---

## OLDER DEZ:
That's not exactly what I say. 

---

## S:
Close enough.

---

Look, Dez. I wouldn't have gotten this far without you.

---

And I get the whole treading lightly, "ripples not waves" thing, but we're running out of time. 

---

## OLDER DEZ:
How so?

---

## S:
William is investigating a mole within the CRC. He wanted the Nameless to tail me 24/7 for my "protection".

---

## OLDER DEZ:
I don't buy it. 

---

## S:
No shit.

---

Knowing him, he already knows it’s me and is just fucking with me. I turned it down, but that probably looked suspicious.

---


So, it's not that I don't appreciate the 272 attempts, I just think we don't have time to fully apply the scientific method right now. 

---

## OLDER DEZ:
Okay, yeah I see the merits of trying a drastically different approach...

---

I'm also running out of ideas. Here.

---

It might take a few jumps to get used to the feeling. Symptoms include raging headache, nausea, black spots in eyes, disorientation-

---

## S:
Cool, great, thanks.

---

Listen. I’d rather reverse dozens of needless deaths, but if I don't come back-

---

## OLDER DEZ:
If I've come back hundreds of times, you will.

---

Albeit with some scars, but still-

---

## S:
Dez. 

---

## OLDER DEZ:
If you don't come back, the flash drive goes to the FBI and every single media outlet.

---

## S:
Thank you. 

---

## OLDER DEZ:
So when would you like to jump to?

---

We've narrowed down the optimal time frame from when you get the sword to when you sign the contract so-



---

## S:
You narrowed it down, but what if I went back and somehow stopped myself from owning the sword? 

---

## OLDER DEZ:
You owning that sword has some sort of butterfly effect.

---

When I tried not giving it to you, the world I came back to was...dark. 

---

## S:
Darker than this shitshow?

---

What?     

---

## OLDER DEZ:
You were head of the CRC.

---

Your weapons of choice were guns, your kill list was extensive, and 	Ava was dead. And you implied that you were the one that did it.

---

That she was one of your targets. 

---

## S:
There’s no fucking way-

---

## OLDER DEZ:
I think having the sword kept Ava 	in your life longer, kept you honorable, in a way.

---

That’s why I’ve been so careful, why I’ve gone back and reset jumps that went even 	the tiniest bit 	awry. We’re trying to tweak our current reality, not create an entirely new one.

---

## S:
You never told me about that. The other reality.

---

## OLDER DEZ:
Didn’t really want to tell you that I met the worst possible version of you, or how bad it could’ve been. 

---

## S:
Sure...Thanks, I guess.

---

## OLDER DEZ:
Are you sure you still want to do this? 

---

## S:
Yeah, I do.

---

## OLDER DEZ:
Okay, great, where do you want to jump to? 

---

## S:
Let’s try right after you give me the sword.

---

I can stop myself before I get home. 

---

## OLDER DEZ:
Can do.

---

Don't forget to watch for the SOS light-

---

## S:
I know, it means something is fucked, come back ASAP. 

---

## OLDER DEZ:
Perhaps not the terms I would use, but sure.

---

Oh, and don't try revealing who you actually are. It never worked for me, and saying you're her from the future will just mindfuck her and make her more angry.

---

## S:
Don't you think it's a little weird that you know my past self better than I do? 

---

## OLDER DEZ:
Absolutely.

---

Coordinates set. Ready?

---







---

## S:
Fuck, he wasn't kidding. 

---

## SLOANE:
Fuck, I’ll figure it out later.

---

S crashes into some trash cans.   

---

## S:
Shit.

---



---

## SLOANE:
Shit.   

---

## S:
Come on, where's the distraction.

---

Bootstraps Thing! bangs trash van lids together
Yes!

---

In the doorway, Nameless gone... See?!

---

I can do ripples! This isn't that hard.

---

police sirens
Dammit, missed her.   







---

## OLDER DEZ:
Well?

---

		

---

## S:
Missed my chance.     

---

## OLDER DEZ:
Wanna go back and try again?

---

## S:
I think 	what I 	just did was how it was supposed to go. It was the Bootstraps Thing-

---

## OLDER DEZ:
Bootstrap Paradox.

---

## S:
Right, that. I'm the one that made the distraction so younger me could get away from 	the Nameless.

---

## OLDER DEZ:
My program isn't reporting any major anomalies, timeline is still intact. Not bad for your first jump.

---

What if we try the gym next? I've always been able to at least start to talk to you once William and The Nameless leave.

---

## S:
Sounds good. You have to convince Vin to cooperate and leave first, right?

---

## OLDER DEZ:
Yep, if not he ends up knocked out or worse. Once he's gone I hide in the office until the fight is over.

---

## S:
Alright. 

---

## OLDER DEZ:
You're good to go.

---








---

## VIN:
Jesus fuck! 

---

## S:
Hey, hi.

---

I'm sorry for the intrusion-

---

## VIN:
Who the fuck are you? 

---

## S:
Police.

---

Some people will be coming in here shortly asking to speak to Sloane, and it's in your best interest to cooperate. 

---

## VIN:
What did Sloane do?

---

## S:
Absolutely nothing, they just want to talk. I assure you that she won't be harmed.

---

## VIN:
Why do they want to talk to her? 

---

## S:
It's classified.

---

## VIN:
So, I just leave her here? 

---

## S:
Just ask her to lock up and go have a drink next door, alright?

---

I'll be here the whole time, and everything will be just fine. Voices are heard
That'll be them.

---

Best not to mention I was here. 

---

## WILLIAM:
Good evening Ms.

---

James. 

---

## VIN:
What can I do for you?

---

## WILLIAM:
One of your members is a Ms.Bridget Sloane, correct? 

---

## VIN:
Yeah, I think she's in the weight room.

---

## WILLIAM:
May we speak with her? 

---

## VIN:
Everything alright?

---

## WILLIAM:
Yes, quite alright, I assure you. But the matter is still quite urgent.

---

## VIN:
Sure I'll take you to her. 

---

## WILLIAM:
No need, we know the way.

---

And it would be best if we spoke with her in private. 

---

## VIN:
No problem.

---

I'll be next door if you all need anything. We're the last ones here, so let me just give her the keys.

---

## WILLIAM:
Thank you Ms. James.

---


What are the specs on this place?     
NAMELESS	
Family owned for four generations, small but loyal membership.

---

## WILLIAM:
Hm. This location is too good for a shithole like this.

---


NAMELESS	
He was approved for a Rent Cap back when the Small Business Survival Act was passed. 

---

## WILLIAM:
Of course she was.

---

It would be much more profitable in our hands. Add it to the list of businesses to solicit.

---

We'll find her price. 
NAMELESS
Yes sir.

---

## WILLIAM:
I believe that is our cue. 

---

## SLOANE (OFFSTAGE):
Sorry, I'm actually locking up for Vin right now-

WILLIAM (OFFSTAGE)
Hello Ms.

---

Sloane. 

---

## SLOANE (OFFSTAGE):
Who are you?

---

Did you send those people after me earlier? 
WILLIAM (OFFSTAGE)
The Nameless?

---

Yes, I did. 

---

## SLOANE (OFFSTAGE):
Why?

---


WILLIAM (OFFSTAGE)
We were just trying to find an opening to speak with you. I’m sorry that they made you uncomfortable.

---

## SLOANE (OFFSTAGE):
Okay, well what did you want to talk to me about? 
WILLIAM (OFFSTAGE)
Check the owner's office.

---

Make sure he actually left. 

---

## S:
Your name is Inez Grant.

---

Your spoiled brats are named Morgan and Samantha. You live on Magnolia out in the burbs, but you tell people you live in the city.

---


You're going to go out there and tell William that this room is clear. Got it?

---


## NAMELESS (OFFSTAGE):
Clear. 

---


## WILLIAM (OFFSTAGE):
Good.

---

## S:
Fuck. 


---

## OLDER DEZ:
What's wrong?

---

## S:
What’s wrong?   

---

## OLDER DEZ:
I got a major anomaly spike - what happened?

---

## S:
I was just standing in the office waiting for William to leave. 

---

## OLDER DEZ:
Something different happened.

---

It may have been small, but it was enough to register way outside our timeline spike limit. 

---

## S:
...Look up Inez Grant in the CRC database.

---

## OLDER DEZ:
Nothing. I’m not seeing record of a person by that name, not even in normal county records, anyone who's alive anyway-

---

## S:
Fuck!

---

## OLDER DEZ:
Wait, what happened? 

---

## S:
She’s a Nameless.

---

She came into the office but all I did was subdue her and tell her I knew her real identity. It was just to make sure no one else bothered me in there.

---

## OLDER DEZ:
We don’t know she’s dead. She could have quit and changed her name.

---

## S:
Let me go back and fix it, reset it. I’ll just hide this time.

---

## OLDER DEZ:
I don't know...I'm worried another trip will irrevocably alter the timeline. The spike leveled out, but we've used this window so much it's really tenuous-

---

## S:
You mean you've used this window-

---

## OLDER DEZ:
Well, technically, yes, but it was the closest I've gotten to succeeding-

---

## S:
Well maybe if I had jumped back before today, I would have actually succeeded-

---

## OLDER DEZ:
Look, every time we go back to that window the anomaly spikes have gotten bigger and bigger, no matter how tiny the ripple.

---

## S:
Why? 

---

## OLDER DEZ:
I don’t know -

---

## S:
How could you not know, you invented this-

---

## OLDER DEZ:
No I didn’t.

---

All I did was figure out how to tap into something that is much bigger than you or I. For all I know there’s some omniscient being watching over all of this whose mad we’re fucking around with reality, and They’re making our spikes grow!

---

## S:
...Comic book? TV show?

---

## OLDER DEZ:
Probably both. I consume a lot of media.

---


My point is, I don’t know all the rules here, at least not yet. We’re trying to change reality, but not too much.

---

It’s a hard line to walk. So, I think it's too dangerous to try that window again.

---


## S:
Okay, fine, I hear you. 

---

## OLDER DEZ:
What about right after this?

---

When you tell Ava about the job but she has to go into work? I've gotten a few solid chances there.

---

## S:
Yeah, let’s try it. 

---

## OLDER DEZ:
The jump point is the backyard.

---

Just wait until Ava goes to the library and then make your move. I've had the most success pretending to be a fellow spy.

---

## S:
...I am a spy. 

---

## OLDER DEZ:
Yes, right, but maybe leave out that you're her future self as a spy.

---

## S:
Just punch in the numbers please. 

---

## OLDER DEZ:
You're good to jump.

---








---

## SLOANE (OFFSTAGE):
Yet you didn't fire me. 

---


## AVA (OFFSTAGE):
Yeah, to discourage your repeated attempts at asking me out.

---

## SLOANE (OFFSTAGE):
Um, I recall that bursting into the library in my cap and gown and saying “You’re not my boss anymore” was considered “cheesy”, yet “adorable”. 

---

## S:
What the-
crashing into the garbage cans

---


## AVA (OFFSTAGE):
See this is why this shit was banned.

---

You're too jumpy with that thing. 

---

## SLOANE (OFFSTAGE):
I’m not jumpy, I’m prepared.

---

	
## AVA (OFFSTAGE):
It's probably just an 	animal- No stay here. 

---

## SLOANE (OFFSTAGE):
You're just trying to prove a point.

---

## AVA:
Yep. 
Are you okay?

---

## S:
Yes, I'm sorry, I just 	seem to have fell-

---

## AVA:
I can get you some food-

---

## S:
No, no, don't I'm fine I promise. 

---

## AVA:
I'm sorry, do I know 	you from somewhere?

---

## S:
No. Again, so sorry to bother you, I'm just going to go-

---

## AVA:
Ok then.

---

## S:
Shit, shit, shit. 


---

## OLDER DEZ:
What happened?

---

## S:
Check the screen-

---

## OLDER DEZ:
Are you okay-

---

## S:
Check the screen! 

---

## OLDER DEZ:
There’s one spike, but it’s not very big.

---

What caused it? 

---

## S:
I landed hard, fell into some trash cans.

---

Ava came out and asked if I was okay. 

---

## OLDER DEZ:
Okay, hold on.

---


Zooming in on the window	Ava left, you ordered the Thai. The rest of the night went
normally.

---

So, just a momentary ripple. 

---

## S:
Thank fuck.

---

## OLDER DEZ:
How are you feeling? 

---

## S:
Like shit.

---

## OLDER DEZ:
Here-

---

## S:
You know I hate raisins. 

---

## OLDER DEZ:
You've done multiple jumps in a row and all I've seen you consume today is coffee.

---

## S:
I ate a bagel at like 9 or something. 

---

## OLDER DEZ:
Eat it.

---

## S:
Okay mom. 

---

## OLDER DEZ:
We'll take a break for a bit, and then we can try that window again.

---


[S's phone buzzes]

---

## S:
Toss me that.

---

Shit. William, I'm listed as "do not contact" today.

---


Of course I'm off grid, I'm doing recon. Do you want my cover blown?

---

I've been checking in as much as I deem appropriate. Well I've been doing this for 20 years, you don't need to micro-manage me.

---

Yes, I'm aware she's top priority. I told you I'm on it.

---

Fine, I'll stop by headquarters in the morning. 
We're fucked.

---


## OLDER DEZ:
What? Why?

---

## S:
My next target is something new. I've only ever taken out government employees, but this woman is a civilian, a civil rights lawyer.

---

## OLDER DEZ:
What does the CRC want with her? 

---

## S:
She got vetted to jump into politics, is running for the first time and is showing a lot of promise.

---

They’re calling her the future of the Progressive Party. 
The intel the CRC is giving me is even thinner than usual, it's like they're barely even trying to lie to me anymore.

---

I've been stalling, hoping we could crack this, but I'm running out of time and excuses. 

---

## OLDER DEZ:
So that's why you wanted to try it yourself.

---

## S:
Yeah. 

---

## OLDER DEZ:
Okay.

---

How much time did you buy with the last phone call? 

---

## S:
Tonight.

---

## OLDER DEZ:
Oof. 

---

## S:
I want to end this before anyone else gets hurt.

---

## OLDER DEZ:
How are you feeling? I can send you back to the last jump point.

---

## S:
I want to try something different. 

---

## OLDER DEZ:
...How different?

---

## S:
So our window is from getting the sword to signing the contract-

---

## OLDER DEZ:
Correct. Trying the morning after signing the contract was disastrous.

---

## S:
...Like alternate reality disastrous? 

---

## OLDER DEZ:
More like multiple cool scars disastrous.

---

## S:
Okay, but what about right after I sign the contract? Literally moments after, on my way home?

---

## OLDER DEZ:
Maybe? I'd like to go back myself first and establish the window a little bit more.

---

## S:
We don’t have time. Just let me try.

---

## OLDER DEZ:
Okay, you're all set. 

---

## S:
Thank you.

---

## OLDER DEZ:
Jump before I change my mind. 

---

## S:
Hey, can we talk?

---

---

## SLOANE:
You're full of shit. 

---

## S:
I wish I was.

---

The CRC is dangerous, and they're not who you think they are-

---

## SLOANE:
Why should I believe you? 

---

## S:
Because I am you!

---

## SLOANE:
Prove it. Say something I've never told anyone else.

---

## S:
You're going to stop by that jeweler on the way home and use the advance to buy the ring you've been eyeing for the last year. 
And yes, hiding it in the sword's lockbox is a good idea.

---

Ava will literally never open that thing. 

---

## SLOANE:
So Dez wasn't crazy then.

---

## S:
Nope. We’ve actually been working together for over a year, trying to convince you to not join the CRC.

---

## SLOANE:
A little late for that. 

---

## S:
Trust me, we tried other times.

---

I wish I would’ve thought of this sooner, alcohol tends to bring our guard down-

---

## SLOANE:
Okay, fine. Why is the CRC dangerous or whatever?

---

## S:
CRC doesn't stand for Congressional Reconnaissance Committee. It stands for Capitalist Resurrection Committee.

---

They’re not a part of the FBI, or even a part of the government at all. They're actually descendants of the former 1% who are pissed that they don't have as much money as their daddies did.

---

## SLOANE:
William just gave me an $800 glass of champagne though. 

---

## S:
I didn't say they weren't rich, they're just not "as rich" as they believe they should be.

---


They've been working in the shadows, trying to bring the "old ways" back. They don't care that that means millions will be poorer, they just want to be richer.

---


The bottom line is that William sold you - us - a complete lie. You think you're going to help maintain the world we live in, but you end up undermining it with every person you murder-


---

## SLOANE:
Wait, murder?

---

I wouldn't do that. I got picked for this because I didn't want to murder people.

---

## S:
I was fed false evidence and made to believe that those people deserved to die, that the fate of our country depended on it. And the pay rate was higher.

---

## SLOANE:
Who cares about money? 

---

## S:
You will.

---

I’m not saying it happens overnight. William knows how to play the long game.

---

Surveillance becomes arrests which becomes “enhanced interrogations” which eventually become hits. Each escalation of violence comes with a promise that it was a necessary evil to keep our country safe...and a raise.

---


You’ll tell yourself that it’s all for Ava. That each horrible act you do actually keeps her safe.

---

And the money doesn’t hurt. You’ll get a beautiful home.

---

You’ll travel to every place you ever wanted to go. Adoption even gets thrown around.

---


Do you remember promising Ava to tell her when the job got to be too much? 


---

## SLOANE:
I’m guessing you didn’t do that?

---

## S:
No, but only because it never was too much. 
We were watching the news one night, and they reported about a politician’s death, and Ava was really upset about it.

---

She believed it was someone who would’ve achieved great things had they lived longer. I decided to finally tell her what I thought was the truth - that the country was better off and that I was the one responsible - and she kicked me out.

---

Haven’t seen her since. She gave this back too.

---

## SLOANE:
That’s it, that’s the ring-

---

## S:
Yep. Her insistence that I killed an innocent person was what actually made me start questioning the CRC.

---

And, as usual, she was right. I regret who I’ve become, and the horrible crimes I’ve committed, with every fiber of my being.

---


I need to believe that there is a version of my life that didn’t turn out like this. Another reality where Ava and I are still together, sitting on the couch eating cheap takeout, where I’m a good person.

---

## SLOANE:
What do I have to do? 

---

## S:
Just quit.

---

Tell William you changed your mind, give him his money back, and get out while you can. Sloan’s phone rings
Wait-
	

---

## SLOANE:
What?

---

## S:
That's new. 

---

## SLOANE:
What?

---

The call? 

---

## S:
Yeah.

---

All I did this night was stop by the jeweler’s and go home. Who is it?

---

## SLOANE:
Just Ava. She picks it up.

---

Hey babe- What's wrong? Who wants me to come home?

---

Just tell me who it is. Tell them I'm coming, just stay calm, I love you.

---

## S:
What's happening? 

---

## SLOANE:
There are people at our house who won't let her leave.

---

She doesn't know who they are, just that they "don't have names."

---

## S:
Let's go. 




---

## SLOANE:
Ava!

---

## WILLIAM:
Ms. Sloane.

---

And you must be S. Never mastered exchanging pleasantries then?

---

## S:
Didn't find it necessary. 

---

## AVA:
You're the woman from the other day-

---

## S:
I am.

---

Sorry again about that. 

---

## AVA:
What are you doing here?

---

## SLOANE:
Long story-

---

## S:
Hold on-

---

## AVA:
How? 

---

## S:
Dez.

---

## AVA:
The person who gave you the sword? 

---

## S:
Yeah.

---

## AVA:
That still doesn't explain why you're here. 

---

## WILLIAM:
If I may interject, your friend Dez isn't the only person in our future who figured out how to manipulate the past.

---

## SLOANE:
You too? 

---

## WILLIAM:
How do you think we've amassed our capital?

---

Future me simply sends present me a message and I know which businesses and ideas to invest in. It is still a free market, no matter how many bills our wannabe Socialist government passes.

---

## AVA:
If I have to explain actual Social ism one more-

---



## S & SLOANE (at the same time):
Babe, 	just don’t-

---

## S:
A message? How do you manage that?

---

Dez and I can only jump physically.   

---

## WILLIAM:
Yes, I saw your wrist contraption.

---

Quite primitive. I’m sure with the proper funding we could take it to the next level-

---

## SLOANE:
No one here is falling for your shit.

---

What’s going on?   

---

## WILLIAM:
Our team was able to create a window tethered to exactly 20 years in the future, and I just received a message that at this very moment, a manhunt is underway for a mole within the CRC, the elder Ms.

---

Sloane here. They couldn't find you, so it was decided to just nip the issue in the bud and terminate your contract before you ever work a single day.

---


Shame really, I was looking forward to our partnership. 

---

## SLOANE:
You got this?

---

I'll get Ava. 

---

## S:
Yeah, go!

---

## SLOANE:
Are you alright? 

---

## AVA:
I'm great.

---

## SLOANE:
We just have to keep putting pressure on it.   

---

## AVA:
I know how to handle-



---

## SLOANE:
Just because you read about it doesn't mean you know how to take care of a stab wound.

---

## AVA:
When's the last time you encountered an actual stabbed person?     

---

## SLOANE:
There 	was-

---

## AVA:
Police academy doesn't count-
	

---

## SLOANE:
Of course it counts-

---

## AVA:
They're holograms!

---

## WILLIAM:
No wonder your marriage doesn't last.   

---

## AVA:
Our what?

---

## SLOANE:

You piece of shit-
	

---

## S:
Go get the first aid kit out of the kitchen, I'll handle him. 

---

## WILLIAM:
Ms. Carter, did you know that your future wife here has an extensive kill list? 

---

## S:
Shut up.

---

## WILLIAM:
I'm certainly not the first person to be at the end of her sword. 

---

## S:
Don't talk to her, talk to me.

---

## WILLIAM:
Alright. 

---

## S:
Hold it.

---

## WILLIAM:
I always envied those swords. An efficient weapon that takes actual skill to wield.

---

And yet they were put in the hands of cops, and outlawed for everyone else. I tried to buy one off of a few officers, but none of them bit.

---

## S:
Money shouldn't be able to get you everything. 

---

## WILLIAM:
It used to.

---

Luckily, my wealth is respected with other weapons dealers-

You think you've won? That it's over?

---

This doesn't end with me. Someone will step up to take my place tomorrow.

---

## SLOANE:
But I'm out. No one is going to die by my hand.

---

## WILLIAM:
You're replaceable too. We'll find someone else to kill those people.

---

Maybe we won't even have to lie to them. Everyone has a price.

---

## SLOANE:
S, are you okay? 

---

## S:
I don't know, I've never been shot before.

---

Hurts like a bitch.

---


[frantic knocking is heard on the back door]

---



---

## OLDER DEZ (OFFSTAGE):
Hello?! S?

---

Ava? Is someone home?

---

## AVA:
Let me help you. Why am I not surprised you’re still stubborn as hell?

---

## OLDER DEZ (OFFSTAGE):
Oh, hello, sorry to bother you. I'm a friend of Ava's-


---

## SLOANE (OFFSTAGE):
I know who you are, Dez.

---

Get in here. 

---

## OLDER DEZ (OFFSTAGE):
What's wrong?

---


Oh no. What happened?

---

## SLOANE:
Fucker had a gun on him somehow. 

---

## OLDER DEZ:
Shit, how are you doing?

---

## S:
I've been better. 

---

## AVA:
I've been trying to pack it, but the blood just keeps soaking through.

---

I don't see an exit wound, so the bullet is probably lodged in there. 

---

## OLDER DEZ:
I thought you were a librarian?

---

## AVA:
I am. 

---

## OLDER DEZ:
My god, I love a woman who reads-

---

## S:
Dez!

---

What the hell are you doing here? 

---

## OLDER DEZ:
The CRC found my lab.

---

I saw a massive anomaly and was about to hit the SOS light, but I got a shiver up my spine, and everything around me felt different. I was confused about where I was and what I was doing.

---

There was a knock at my door, someone announced they were CRC, and something in my brain clicked. My guess is I became consciously aware of the timeline changing.

---

So, I grabbed the prototype of the jumper, and came here before I lost my memory of everything. 

---

## SLOANE:
Was it me at your door though?

---

Like a different version of S or something? 

---

## OLDER DEZ:
I don’t think so, it didn’t sound like you.

---

## S:
Our replacement then. 

---

## OLDER DEZ:
What do you mean?

---

## S:
Everything that happened in our timeline is still going to happen, it’s just not William and I doing it. 

---

## OLDER DEZ:
Good thing I brought this then.

---

## S:
Do it now. Release all the info.

---

There’s evidence on there that predates my involvement. We'll just whistle blow on them now before anyone gets the chance to murder those people-

---

## SLOANE:
No, we should get you to a hospital first.

---

## S:
I won't make it to a hospital. 

---

## AVA:
We won't know until we try-

---

## S:
Babe, don't.

---

I'm not worth it. 

---

## AVA:
Worth it?

---

That doesn't-

---

## S:
This version of me shouldn't even exist. And trust me, you don't like her.

---

## SLOANE:
But, technically, doesn't this version of you - me - not exist anymore? We changed it.

---

## S:
Yeah, so me dying makes sense, doesn't it? 

---

## SLOANE:
But, you could stay here, in this timeline-

---

## OLDER DEZ:
We can't be here permanently.

---

The anomaly surges with a prolonged presence-

---

## S:
Dez, I love you, but we don't have time for that. Look, the person I became over the last two decades was greedy, and cruel.

---

So. Please let me do this one last good thing.

---

Dez, do it. Don't fuck it up.

---


## OLDER DEZ:
Consider the whistle blown. 

---

## DEZ:
I’m sorry the door was open-
Oh no-

---

## OLDER DEZ:
You really shouldn’t be here-

---

## DEZ:
I know, but the monitoring device you gave me completely flatlined, and I got worried so-

---

## OLDER DEZ:
It’s okay.

---

The device flatlined because that timeline no longer exists. But I think that might be for the best.

---

## DEZ:
So what happens now? 

---

## OLDER DEZ:
...I don’t actually know.

---

I don’t even know how or why I’m still here, why I remember events from my timeline, I’ve somehow created a space-time continuum loophole that I can’t even begin to comprehend, let alone explain-

---

## AVA:
It’s like you now exist outside of time-

---

## DEZ:
Perhaps it was how or when you jumped-


---

## SLOANE:
I love you all, but I’d rather figure out how to move forward rather than try to explain how we got here. We’re here, and that’s not changing...So, what now?

---


A loud knock at the front door. 

---

## S (OFFSTAGE):
Sloane?

---

Sloane, listen, I just want to talk. I’m sure you’re apprehensive about dealing with, well, another you...again.

---

But I promise it’s worth your time.   

---

## SLOANE:
How do I know I can trust you?

---

## S (OFFSTAGE):
Well, I haven’t broken down the door, that should be good for something.   

---

## AVA:
What are you doing??

---

## SLOANE:
Do you trust me?   

---

## AVA:
You, yes.

---

Her, no.   

---

## SLOANE:
But that is me.

---

## DEZ:
But you changed in 	the future-

---

## SLOANE:
So did you! But at your core, you were still the funny nerd with an outdated tech obsession.

---

And yes, I did really terrible things, but at my core, I still wanted to do good. That’s 	why all of this even happened.

---


Right? 

---

## OLDER DEZ:
Right.

---



## SLOANE:
So, who can I trust if not myself? 

---

## S (OFFSTAGE):
You know I can hear you all, right?

---

Come on, just open the door.   

---

## SLOANE:
Just a second!

---


## DEZ:
But, we don’t have time jumping anymore, and she clearly does. We don’t know what she’s like in the new timeline, or maybe she’s from an entirely different universe, there’s just too many unknown variables-

---

## OLDER DEZ:
We’ve been cheating, you’re supposed to live your life with unknown variables.

---

Maybe the way to move forward is simply by not knowing what’s coming next. 

---

## AVA:
Are you sure you know what you’re doing?

---

## SLOANE:
No. Only one way to find out though, right?

---
