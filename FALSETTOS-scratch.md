WELL, THE SITUATION’S THIS I DO NOT WISH TO OFFEND I DIVORCED MY WIFE, I LEFT MY CHILD AND I RAN OFF WITH A FRIEND.

AND I SING OUT AS THEY COOK.

I LOVE MY TIGHT-KNIT FAMILY.

I LOVE THE WAY THEY COOK LINGUINE. ISN’T IT GREAT, WE’RE ALL SO SWELL. SUCH A DEAR CLIENTELE.

THAT’S A QUESTION WITH NO ANSWER.

---



LET’S NOT DISCUSS THE WEATHER; LET’S FACE THE FACTS. MARVIN’S WIFE MUST RELAX.

## TRINA:
LOVE ISN’T SEX.

THAT A THING MY HUSBAND ONCE TOLD ME. MARVIN, MY EX –

---



YOU’VE SEEN HIM FOR YEARS TOLD ME OVER THE PHONE TO TELL YOU MY FEARS. DO YOU ONLY TREAT QUEERS?



---

## MENDEL:
BREATHE DEEP, MY DEAR –

YOU’LL FIND ME UNDERSTANDING. YOUR PAIN IS A PRIORI; UNFOLD YOUR UNTOLD STORY. NOW TO BREAK BREAD… LOOSEN YOUR GLANDS;

---



PUT YOUR HEAD IN MY HANDS.



---

## TRINA:
I’M EVERYTHING HE WANTED. IT’S TIME I PUT IT ALL TOGETHER: THE DATE WAS SET MY FATHER LET ME MARRY.

I MARRIED, I…

---



THEN MARVIN CAME FROM WORK. SAT ME DOWN ON THE BED.

HE TOLD ME HOW HE LOVED ME, HOW HE NEEDED AND/OR VALUED ME. I HAVE…



---

## MENDEL:

---

## MARVIN:

I AM PROBABLY DISEASED.



---

## MENDEL:
YOU’RE A LOVELY GIRL.

---



THEY FAKED DESPAIR; THEY WET THEIR BED. THEY COMBED THEIR HAIR; THEY ACTED DEAD. ONE SAID…



---

## MENDEL:
YES?



---

## JASON:
DADDY IS A PRICK.



---

## MENDEL:

---

## TRINA:

---

## MENDEL:

## JASON:

---

## MENDEL:

---

## TRINA:
HE FILLED MY COATS WITH CANDIES AND NOTES, WITH “WILL YOU BE MY VALENTINE?”

I’VE NEVER MARRIED. WORK…WORK IS MY PASSION. OR PERHAPS THAT’S AN ALIBI.



---

## MARVIN:
PERHAPS IT IS.



---

## MENDEL:
I DON’T CARE TO DISCUSS IT.

I THINK SHE’S CHARMING.

I THINK SHE’S NEEDY.

IN JUST FIVE SESSIONS ON MY COUCH, SHE’LL BE LIKE NEW.

## MARVIN, JASON, and TRINA:

WE’VE BEEN TOGETHER FOR NINE MONTHS.



---

## MARVIN:
TEN MONTHS.



---

## WHIZZER:
NINE MONTHS.



---

## MARVIN:
TEN MONTHS.



---

## WHIZZER:
NINE MONTHS.



---

## MARVIN:
TEN MONTHS.

WE ARE THE SALT OF THE BOURGEOISIE.



---

## WHIZZER:
WHILE I PUT THE STEAK IN…



---

## MARVIN:
I BRING HOME THE BACON.




---

## MARVIN and WHIZZER:
AND WE’RE PROUD TO SAY WE LOVE IT HOW WE…



---

## WHIZZER:
…WON’T… …WON’T… …WON’T…



---

## MARVIN:
…DON’T… …DON’T… …DON’T…


MARVIN and WHIZZER:
…AGREE.



---

## WHIZZER:
EVERYTHING HE OWNS IS VILE.

MARVIN DOESN’T CARE A WHIT.

MARVIN DOESN’T SHARE MY DEVOTION TO STYLE.

MEN FROM FRANCE CAN CANCEL A DEBT. MEN IN CUFFLINKS MAKE ME FORGET MY NAME.

I INTEND TO UPSET THIS REGRETTABLE GAME.



---

## MARVIN:
WHIZZER TAKES ME BY THE NECK.



---

## WHIZZER:
WHAT IS THIS WASH ‘N’ WEAR?



---

## MARVIN:
WHIZZER HAS UNLIMITED KNOWLEDGE OF DRECK.



---

## WHIZZER:

---

## WHIZZER:

---

## MARVIN:

---

## WHIZZER:
SEE HOW QUICKLY HE SOURS.



---

## MARVIN:
WHEN HE PUSHES, I PULL.



---

## WHIZZER:
HANG UP YOUR CLOTHES. MARVIN. BREEDING SHOWS. MARVIN.



---

## MARVIN:
I WAS RICH.

HE WAS HORNY.



---

## WHIZZER:
WE FIT LIKE A GLOVE.



---

## MARVIN:
CLOSE YOUR EYES, WHIZZER.



---

## WHIZZER:
PASSION DIES.

BUT I’D KILL FOR THAT THRILL OF FIRST LOVE.


MARVIN and WHIZZER:
WE ASK FOR PASSION AT ALL TIMES.

WE STAND TO PASSION AND DRINK THIS TOAST.



---

## WHIZZER:
STILL IT’S AWFULLY TRYING…



---

## MARVIN:
AND WE’RE NOT DENYING…




---

## MARVIN and WHIZZER:
THAT OF ALL THE LESSER PASSIONS, WE LIKE FIGHTING MOST.



---

## MARVIN:
WHIZZER SCREWS TOO MUCH TO SEE

WHAT A JOY’S MONOGAMY WHAT A JOY IS SAVING HIS JOYS FOR ONE MAN?



---

## WHIZZER:
LEAVE ME.



---

## MARVIN:
LOVE ME.



---

## WHIZZER:
DON’T BE A FOOL.



---

## MARVIN:
WANT ME.



---

## WHIZZER:
FEED ME.



---

## MARVIN:
NO ONE’S SO CRUEL AND CHEAP.



---

## WHIZZER:
WHAT I LOVE, I DEVOUR.



---

## MARVIN:
WHAT YOU LOVE, YOU DEVOUR. WHAT I COVET, I KEEP.

ISN’T THAT RIGHT, WHIZZER? LET’S BOTH FIGHT, WHIZZER.



---

## WHIZZER:
I WAS TRAINED IN KARATE.



---

## MARVIN:
I’M BEST WHEN I CHEAT.

SO, I’LL CHEAT, WHIZZER, AND I’LL SHOVE, AND I’LL KILL FOR THAT THRILL OF FIRST LOVE.



---

## WHIZZER:
WE’VE BEEN TOGETHER FOR NINE MONTHS.



---

## MARVIN:
TEN MONTHS.



---

## WHIZZER:
NINE MONTHS.



---

## MARVIN:
WE’VE BEEN TOGETHER FOR TEN MONTHS.



---

## WHIZZER:
NINE MONTHS.



---

## MARVIN:
TEN MONTHS.

IN FACT, WE’VE ALMOST SURVIVED A YEAR.



---

## WHIZZER:
TRUE, BUT…


MARVIN and WHIZZER:
WHO IS COUNTING?

WE’RE TOO BUSY MOUNTING A DISPLAY OF OUR AFFECTION THAT IS SO SINCERE.

PASSION DIES. PASSION DIES.



---

## WHIZZER:
I WOULD KILL FOR THAT THRILL OF FIRST LOVE.

I WOULD KILL FOR THAT THRILL OF FIRST LOVE.



---

## MARVIN:
I WOULD KILL FOR THAT THRILL OF FIRST LOVE.

I WOULD KILL FOR THAT THRILL


MARVIN and WHIZZER:
I WOULD KILL FOR THAT THRILL OF FIRST LOVE.

LOVE.

LO-VE.



---

## JASON:
MY FATHER SAYS THAT LOVE IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING IN THE WORLD. I THINK GAMES ARE.

I THINK CHESS IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING.

NOT LOVE.



---

## WHIZZER:
“Marvin at the psychiatrist,” a three-part mini-opera. Part one.



---

## MENDEL:
DO YOU LOVE HIM?



---

## MARVIN:
SORTA KINDA.



---

## MENDEL:
DO YOU NEED HIM?



---

## MARVIN:
SORTA KINDA.

HE MAKES ME SMILE A LOT, ESPECIALLY AT MEALTIME. MAKES ME FEEL I’M SORTA SMART.



---

## MENDEL:
IS HE SPECIAL?



---

## MARVIN:
HE’S DELIGHTFUL.



---

## MENDEL:
AND ROMANTIC?



---

## MARVIN:
YES, AND SPITEFUL.

BUT YET IT SEEMS THAT SO AM I.



---

## MENDEL:
JUST ENJOY WHAT YOU CAN LOVE THE BOY, NOT THE MAN.



---

## MARVIN:
MAN.

SORTA STYLISH.



---

## MENDEL:
KINDA VERY.



---

## MARVIN:
VERY, VERY SORTA.



---

## MENDEL:
AND KINDA HARD TO DESCRIBE.



---

## MARVIN:
Oh, yes. Oh, I think that’s very true.



---

## MENDEL:
WHEN HE’S NAKED…



---

## MARVIN:
YES.



---

## MENDEL:
DOES HE THRILL YOU?



---

## MARVIN:
YES.



---

## MENDEL:
IS HE VICIOUS?



---

## MARVIN:
YES.



---

## MENDEL:
WOULD HE KILL YOU?



---

## MARVIN:
YES.

I THINK HE’S SORTA KINDA MEAN. BUT I LOVE HIM AND I NEED IT.

IF HE LOVED ME, I’D CONCEDE IT.



---

## MENDEL:
DON’T DESPISE WHAT YOU FEEL.

LOVE THE FRIEND, NOT THE HEEL.



---

## MARVIN:
HEEL.



---

## MENDEL:
HE’S SOMETIMES WORTHLESS.



---

## MARVIN:
SOMETIMES EVIL.



---

## MENDEL:
SOMETIMES SMARMY?



---

## WHIZZER:
Part Two.



---

## MENDEL:
EXPLORE MR. MARVIN.

YOUR CORE, MR. MARVIN, HOW YOUR WIFE’S – YOUR EX-WIFE’S – SUBTLE GLORIES, COUPLED WITH HER TRAGIC STORIES, MOVE ME IN UNREPORTED WAYS.

AT HER VERY FIRST SESSION SHE MADE A STRIKING IMPRESSION.

DO YOU MIND THAT…

SHE WAS HERE TO SPEAK OF JASON AND I FIND THAT…

I HOPE JASON ACTS OUT MORE.

‘CAUSE THERE’S A FEW MORE THINGS WE NEED TO EXPLORE.



---

## MARVIN:
Good.



---

## MENDEL:
Going on.

YOU SAID SHE WAS WITHHOLDING.



---

## MARVIN:
RIGHT.



---

## MENDEL:
WELL, THAT’S NOT QUITE TRUE.



---

## MARVIN:
NO?



---

## MENDEL:
PERHAPS SHE HELD BACK LOVE FROM YOU.



---

## MARVIN:
DID SHE REALLY?



---

## MENDEL:
I JUST KNOW WHAT I’M TOLD. ‘CAUSE WHEN I MET YOUR WIFE SHE WAS ANYTHING BUT COLD. IT WASN’T QUITE PRECISE TO SAY THAT SHE WAS ICE.

WHEN I MET YOUR WIFE SHE WAS VERY NICE.

VERY VERY VERY.

WAS SHE FAITHFUL? BE OBJECTIVE.



---

## MARVIN:
YES.



---

## MENDEL:
SHE WAS FAITHFUL.



---

## MARVIN:
YES.



---

## MENDEL:
AND YOU WANTED TO…IMPRESS HER.



---

## MARVIN:
YES, SIR.

YES, SIR.

BUT IMPRESS HER I DID NOT.



---

## MENDEL:
DID SHE SWEAT A LOT?



---

## MARVIN:
What?



---

## MENDEL:
WAS SHE RUTHLESS?



---

## MARVIN:
Huh?



---

## MENDEL:
NARCISSISTIC?



---

## MARVIN:
Who?



---

## MENDEL:
LET ME VARY THE MOOD…



---

## MARVIN:
Yes please.



---

## MENDEL:
DOES SHE SLEEP IN THE NUDE?



---

## MARVIN:
No.



---

## MENDEL:
Does not sleep nude.

Okay, going on.

I HAVE QUESTIONS THAT SHOULD PROB’LY GO UNANSWERED BUT THEY ARE QUESTIONS LIKE

DOES SHE WEAR A NEGLIGEE?

COULD YOU BLOW AND IT WOULD BLOW AWAY?

SINCE THE SESSION’S NEARLY THROUGH, TELL ME WHAT IS GOING ON WITH YOU?



---

## MARVIN:
So now you’re interested in me?



---

## MENDEL:
Of course.



---

## WHIZZER:
Part three.



---

## MARVIN:
MY SON’S DISTRESSING.



---

## JASON:
MY FATHER’S SNIDE.



---

## MARVIN:
I’M CONVALESCING.



---

## JASON:
HE’S MORBID AND DISSATISFIED.



---

## MARVIN:
WHAT SHOULD I DO NOW?



---

## JASON:
HE LOVES ANOTHER.



---

## MARVIN:
I AGREE.



---

## JASON:
I LOVE MY MOTHER.



---

## MARVIN:
WHY NOT ME?

WE GO TO BALL GAMES.



---

## JASON:
THE BALL IS TOSSED.



---

## MARVIN:
THE PITCHER’S HANDSOME.



---

## JASON:
YEAH, AND OUR TEAM LOST.



---

## MARVIN:
IS THAT MY FAULT, THOUGH? SHOULD I BE BLAMED FOR THAT?



---

## JASON:
EXPLORE MUSEUMS.



---

## MARVIN:
ADMIRE ART.



---

## JASON:
WE STAND TOGETHER.



---

## MARVIN:
BUT WE STAND THERE LOOKING MILES APART. HOW DO I REACH HIM?

WHAT WORDS OF WISDOM?

WHAT SHOULD I DO NOW?



---

## JASON:
MY FATHER SAYS THAT LOVE IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING IN THE WORLD. I THINK GAMES ARE.

I THINK CHESS IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING.

NOT LOVE.



---

## WHIZZER:
“Marvin at the psychiatrist,” a three-part mini-opera.



---

## MENDEL:
The end.



---

## JASON:
MY FATHER’S A HOMO.

MY MOTHER’S NOT THRILLED AT ALL. FATHER HOMO…

WHAT ABOUT CHROMO – – SOMES? DO THEY CARRY?

WILL THEY CARRY?

WHO’S THE HOMO NOW?

MY FATHER SAID THAT ONE DAY I’LL GROW UP TO BE PRESIDENT.

AND THAT IDEA’S NOT SO WILD.

I DON’T LEAD THE LIFE OF A NORMAL CHILD… ‘CAUSE I’M TOO SMART FOR MY OWN GOOD, AND I’M TOO GOOD FOR MY SORRY LITTLE LIFE.

MY MOTHER’S NO WIFE. AND MY FATHER’S NO MAN, NO MAN AT ALL.



---

## TRINA:
Honey, why don’t you go out and play?



---

## JASON:
No.



---

## TRINA:
SWEETHEART, I WORRY. SWEETHEART, I DO.

I WORRY A LOT.

I WORRY A LOT.

I WORRY A LOT.

I could take you to the Jewish center.

I THINK YOU LIKE PLAYING CHESS ALONE. THAT’S NOT NORMAL.



---

## JASON:
WHAT IS NORMAL?



---

## TRINA:
I wouldn’t know.

WHY DON’T YOU SPEAK ON THE TELEPHONE WITH ANYONE?

JUST GET A FRIEND – ANYONE.

DARLING, PLEASE SEE A PSYCHIATRIST. HE’S QUITE A GUY AND I ADMIRE HOW HE ACTS.

NO ONE IS SAYING YOU’RE A SICK NEUROTIC, BUT YOU COULD FIND SOME HELP.

HEAR ME OUT, PLEASE.

YES, YOU COULD FIND SOME HELP.

HE COULD HELP YOU RE-A-LIZE HOW CONFUSED YOU ARE .

IT’S VERY CLEAR:

DADDY’S SINCERE, BUT A SCHMO.

YOU AND I MUST TRUST OUR EMOTIONS,

MAKE NO COMMOTIONS. WILL YOU GO?



---

## JASON:
No.



---

## MARVIN:
JASON, PLEASE SEE A PSYCHIATRIST. HE’S JUST A PSYCHIATRIST.

I’LL PAY THE BILL UNTIL YOU’RE OLD.



---

## MARVIN:
JASON, PLEASE

SEE A PSYCHIATRIST.

HE’S JUST A PSYCHIATRIST. I’LL PAY THE BILL UNTIL YOU’RE

OLD.



---

## TRINA:
DARLING, PLEASE. LISTEN TO YOUR FATHER HERE

HE’S NOT A GENIUS TYPE,

LORD KNOWS. BUT HE KNOWS

WHAT’S TRUE.

HE CHOSE A MAN WHO I THINK KNOWS THE ANSWERS TO ALL YOUR PROBLEMS. MENDEL UNDERSTANDS WHAT’S BOTHERING YOU.



---

## JASON:
NO, I WON’T GO.

I WILL NOT GO.

NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER

NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER.



---

## JASON:
FORGET IT.

MARVIN, TRINA, and JASON:

WHAT A MESS THIS IS, THIS FAMILY. EXPERTS CAN SEE THIS IS SO.

PHOTOGRAPHS CAN’T CAPTURE OUR MAGIC, WE’RE SIMPLY TRAGIC.



---

## MARVIN and TRINA:
WILL YOU GO?



---

## JASON:
No.



---

## MARVIN and TRINA:
JASON, PLEASE SEE A PSYCHIATRIST. HE’S NOT –



---

## JASON:
I WON’T SAY BOO.



---

## MARVIN and TRINA:
– EXORBITANT, AND HE’S VERY SMART.



---

## JASON:
IF INTELLIGENCE WERE THE ONLY CRITERION, THEN I REALLY WOULDN’T NEED A PSYCHIATRIST,

WOULD I?



---

## TRINA:
NO.



---

## JASON:
WOULD I?



---

## MARVIN:
NO.



---

## JASON:
JUST BECAUSE YOU’VE FAILED AS PARENTS.



---

## TRINA:
GET THEE TO A PSYCHIATRIST.



---

## MARVIN:
HEY, KID, LISTEN.



---

## JASON:
I DON’T NEED…



---

## MARVIN and TRINA:
HE NEEDS A PSYCHIATRIST.



---

## JASON:
I WANT…



---

## MARVIN and TRINA:
A PSYCHIATRIST.



---

## JASON:

WHIZZER. WHIZZER.

WHIZZER. WHIZZER.

## JASON:
WHIZZER, DO YOU THINK I SHOULD SEE A PSYCHIATRIST?

## WHIZZER:
I’M NOT SURE, JASON.

OH - JASON, MAYBE SO.

ABSOLUTELY, JASON.



---

## JASON:
OKAY, I’LL GO.

## WHIZZER:
HE’LL GO.



---

## JASON:
I’LL GO.



---

## TRINA:
HE’LL GO.



---

## JASON:
IF HE COMES HERE.



---

## MARVIN:
IF HE COMES HERE?



---

## TRINA:
HE MIGHT COME HERE.

## MARVIN:
THEY DON’T MAKE HOUSE CALLS.

## WHIZZER:
UH-OH.

LATE FOR DINNER, LATE AGAIN.


## WHIZZER, MARVIN, and TRINA:

LATE FOR DINNER, LATE AGAIN.

## JASON, MARVIN and TRINA:

LATE FOR DINNER, LATE AGAIN.

LATE FOR DINNER – LATE, LATE, LATE, LATE.

LATE FOR DINNER, LATE AGAIN.

LATE FOR DINNER, LATE AGAIN.

LATE FOR DINNER, LATE AGAIN.

LATE FOR DINNER – LATE, LATE, LATE, LATE.



---

## MARVIN:
WHIZZER’S SUPPOSED TO ALWAYS BE HERE, MAKING DINNER, SET TO SCREW.

THAT’S WHAT PRETTY BOYS SHOULD DO.

CHECK THEIR HAIRLINES, MAKE THE DINNER, AND LOVE ME.

THIS IS GOING NOWHERE AND FAST, WHIZZER. THIS LITTLE THING THAT WE HAVE WILL NOT LAST. DON’T FEEL RESPONSIBLE.

AFTER ALL, IT’S THROUGH.



---

## WHIZZER:
I’M NOT RESPONSIBLE.



---

## MARVIN:
LIFE CAN BE WONDERFUL ISN’T THIS WONDERFUL? – AND THIS HAD BETTER COME TO A STOP, WHIZZER. NOW, WHIZZER…

CIAO, WHIZZER.

BEND.

THIS HAD BETTER COME TO AN END.



---

## TRINA:
I WAS SUPPOSED TO MAKE THE DINNER, MAKE IT PRETTY ON HIS PLATE.

EV’RY WIFE SHOULD PULL HER WEIGHT. HAVE IT READY, MAKE IT TASTY AND LOVE HIM.

THIS HAD BETTER COME TO A STOP, DOCTOR. THIS HAS BEEN A TRAGIC AND HORRIBLE FLOP.



---

## MENDEL:
DON’T FEEL RESPONSIBLE. AFTER ALL, IT’S THROUGH.



---

## TRINA:
WHO IS RESPONSIBLE?



---

## MENDEL:
DON’T ASK ME QUESTIONS.

I’M FRIGHTENED OF QUESTIONS BUT GRATEFUL THAT ITS COME TO A STOP, TRINA. SMILE, TRINA.

I’LL HELP YOU MEND.



---

## TRINA and WHIZZER:

I MET THIS MAN TODAY.

HE WASN’T VERY SMART. BUT HE WAS RICH, MARVIN. WHICH, MARVIN, DO YOU PREFER I LUST FOR BRAINS OR MONEY?



---

## MARVIN:
BRAINS, I’M NOT SO RICH, BUT HELL, I’M SMART. LOVE ME.



---

## MENDEL, TRINA and WHIZZER:
BRAINS OR MONEY?


---

## TRINA, WHIZZER, JASON and MENDEL:
NO.



---

## MARVIN:
LOVE ME, PLEASE OR BREAK MY HEART.



---

## TRINA and WHIZZER:

THIS IS ALL VERY NEAT. THIS IS ALL VERY SMART.



---

## MARVIN:
THIS IS ALL VERY NEAT. THIS IS ALL VERY NEAT. THIS IS ALL VERY SMART.



---

## MARVIN:
THIS HAD BETTER COME TO A STOP, MENDEL DON’T TOUCH ME.

DON’T CONDESCEND.

THIS HAD BETTER COME THIS HAD BETTER COME TO A THIS, THIS, THIS, THIS, THIS HAD BETTER COME TO AN END.

THIS HAD BETTER COME TO AN END.



---

## TRINA:
CHOP, CHOP, CHOP, CHOP, CHOP. I CHOPPED IT AND SERVED HIS FOOD.

THE ASSHOLE FORCED ME.



---

## WHIZZER, MENDEL and JASON:
CHOP CHOP CHOP CHOP CHOP CHOP CHOP CHOP.



---

## TRINA:
AND STILL THE BASTARD DIVORCED ME.



---

## TRINA:
IT ISN’T LIKE HE SAYS.

YOU PROBABLY

HURT HIS PRIDE. HE'S GOTTA HAVE

HE'S LIKE A BABY WHO’S DENIED.

## WHIZZER, MENDEL, and JASON:
THIS HAD BETTER COME TO A STOP, MARVIN.



---

## TRINA, WHIZZER, MENDEL, and JASON:
THIS HAS BEEN A LOUSY BUT FABULOUS FLOP.



---

## WHIZZER:
WHY IS IT ALWAYS OURSELVES WHO HAVE TO CHANGE?



---

## MARVIN:
THIS IS INCREDIBLY BORING.




---

## WHIZZER and TRINA:
YOU’VE GOT A TEMPER THAT REDEFINES TEMPER AND –



---

## TRINNA, WHIZZER, MENDEL, and JASON:

THIS HAD BETTER COME TO A STOP, MARVIN.

WHY, MARVIN…

TRY, MARVIN.

BEND.

THIS HAD BETTER COME THIS HAD BETTER COME TO A THIS, THIS, THIS, THIS, THIS HAD BETTER COME TO AN END.



---

## MARVIN:
THIS HAD BETTER COME TO AN END



---

## ALL:
THIS HAD BETTER COME TO AN END.



---

## TRINA:
I’D LIKE TO BE A PRINCESS ON A THRONE, AND HAVE A COUNTRY I CAN CALL MY OWN. AND A KING WHO’S LUSTY AND REQUIRES A FLING WITH A FEMALE THING.

GREAT… …MEN WILL BE MEN.

I CAUGHT THEM IN THE DEN WITH MARVIN GRABBING WHIZZER’S ASS.

OH SURE, I’M SURE HE’S SURE HE DID HIS BEST.

I MEAN, HE MEANT TO BE WHAT HE WAS NOT.

THE THINGS HE WAS ARE THINGS WHICH I’VE FORGOT. HE’S A QUEEN.

I’M A QUEEN.

WHERE IS OUR CROWN?

I’M BREAKING DOWN.

I’M BREAKING DOWN.

MY LIFE IS SHITTY AND MY KID SEEMS LIKE AN IDIOT TO ME.

I MEAN, THAT’S SICK.

I MEAN, HE’S GREAT.

IT’S ME WHO IS THE MATTER, TALKING MADDER THAN THE MADDEST HATTER.

IF I REPEAT ONE MORE WORD, I SWEAR I’LL LOSE MY BRAIN.

WHAT ELSE SHOULD I EXPLAIN?

OH YES, IT’S TRUE, I CAN CRY ON CUE BUT SO CAN YOU.

I’M BREAKING DOWN.

I’M BREAKING DOWN.

DOWN. DOWN.

YOU ASK ME, “IS IT FUN TO CRY OVER NOTHING?” IT IS.

I’M BREAKING DOWN.

Oh darn, don’t have time for a breakdown now. Have to get back to my chicken marengo.

Oh, that really hurt.

NOW LET’S CONSIDER WHAT I MIGHT DO NEXT.

I HATE ADMITTING I’VE BECOME PERPLEXED.

I’M BEREAVED.

I’VE CRIED, I’VE SHOOK, I’VE YELLED, I’VE HEAVED. I HAVE BEEN DECEIVED.

AS ENEMIES GO WHIZZER IS NOT THAT BAD.

IT’S JUST HE’S SO DAMN HAPPY THAT HE MAKES ME SO DAMN SAD.

I WANT TO HATE HIM, BUT I REALLY CAN’T.

IT’S LIKE A NIGHTMARE HOW THIS ALL PROCEEDS.

I HOPE THAT WHIZZER DON’T FULFILL HIS NEEDS. “DON’T” IS WRONG.

SING ALONG.

WHAT WAS THAT NOUN?

I’M BREAKING DOWN.

I’M BREAKING DOWN.

I’LL SOON REDECORATE THESE STALLS.

I’D LIKE SOME PADDING ON THE WALLS.

AND ALSO PILLS.

I WANNA SLEEP.

SURE, THINGS WILL PROB’LY WORSEN, BUT IT’S NOT LIKE I’M SOME HEALTHY PERSON.

I’VE RETHOUGHT MY TALKS WITH MARV AND ONE FACT DOES EMERGE:

I THINK I LIKE HIS SHRINK.

SO THAT IS WHY I SHOULD TURN TO DRINK I’M ON THE BRINK OF BREAKING DOWN.

I’M BREAKING DOWN.

DOWN. DOWN.

I ONLY WANT TO LOVE A MAN WHO CAN LOVE ME OR LIKE ME OR HELP ME.

MARVIN WAS NEVER MINE.

HE TOOK HIS MEETINGS IN THE BOYS’ LATRINE.

I USED TO CRY.

HE'D MAKE A SCENE.

I’D RATHER DIE THAN DRY CLEAN MARVIN’S WEDDING GOWN.

I’M BREAKING DOWN.

I’M BREAKING DOWN.

IT'S SO UPSETTING WHEN I FOUND THAT WHAT’S RECTANGULAR IS ROUND.

I MEAN, IT STINKS.

I MEAN, HE’S QUEER.

AND ME, I’M JUST A FREAK WHO NEEDS IT MAYBE EVERY OTHER WEEK.

I’VE RETHOUGHT THE FUN WE HAD AND ONE FACT DOES EMERGE:

I’VE PLAYED A FOOLISH CLOWN.

THE ALMOST-VIRGIN WHO SINGS THIS DIRGE IS ON THE VERGE OF BREAKING DOWN.

I’M BREAKING DOWN.

DOWN. DOWN.

THE ONLY THING THAT’S BREAKING UP IS MY FAMILY.

THE ONLY THING THAT’S BREAKING UP IS MY FAMILY.

BUT ME, I’M BREAKING DOWN. DOWN.

## TRINA:
DR. MENDEL, PLEASE.



---

## MENDEL:
This is Mendel Weisenbachfeld.



---

## TRINA:
DR. MENDEL, VIS À VIS WHAT MARVIN DID, OR RATHER, HASN’T DONE.



---

## MENDEL:
Trina, how are you?



---

## TRINA:
YOU MUST EXORCISE A DEVIL ‘CAUSE IT INHABITS MARVIN’S SON.

PLEASE COME TO OUR HOUSE AND TALK A BIT TO JASON.

IT’S A SLIGHT EXAGGERATION, BUT HE’S SICK IN THE HEAD.

OH, SURE, SOMETIMES YOU’LL THINK HE’S WONDERFUL, BUT HE’S WILD. I’M SURE HE’S MARVIN’S CHILD.



---

## JASON:
WHAT SHOULD I SAY TO THE MAN? SHOULD I BE MEAN TO THE MAN?



---

## TRINA:
JUST BE YOURSELF.



---

## JASON:
I’LL BE MYSELF.



---

## TRINA:
STOP ASKING QUESTIONS. BE YOURSELF.



---

## JASON:
I’LL BE MYSELF.



---

## TRINA:
DON’T BE DISGUSTING. BE YOURSELF.



---

## JASON:
HELLO TO MY HOUSE SO GOOD OF YOU TO TRAVEL.

ON ACCOUNT OF MY UNRAVELING. NOW LET’S EAT SOME FOOD.



---

## MENDEL:
LET’S TALK.



---

## TRINA:
I THINK BEFORE THE FOOD GETS COLD…



---

## MENDEL:
TIME TO JAW.

FIRST I’LL EXTEND MY PAW.

I THINK SHE’S HOLDING IT SO TENDERLY I’LL PROB’LY FAINT.

IF SO, I’D RATHER DIE IN THIS POSITION THAN REMAIN THE SAINT YOU THINK YOU KNOW.

I’M NOT, ALTHOUGH I MUST BE SHOWING BETTER THAN THE NORM RESTRAINT.




---

## JASON, TRINA, and MENDEL:
OH, WHAT A LOVELY TABLE.

SUCH A ROMANTIC TABLE.

KNIVES IN PLACE, LOTSA SPACE TO SPREAD OUT AND EAT.

NOTICE HOW OUR EYES DISCREETLY…

PLEASE COME TO OUR HOUSE. THE DINNER’S ON THE TABLE.

WE WILL TALK IF WE ARE ABLE TO, BUT PROB’LY WE WON’T.

WE SIT.



---

## MENDEL:
THE KID LOOKS PRETTY MIS’RABLE.



---

## JASON:
UNINSPIRED.



---

## MENDEL:
AIN’T THAT THE TRUTH?




---

## JASON, TRINA, and MENDEL:
WE’RE TIRED.



---

## MENDEL:
I THINK THE ROOM LOOKS JUST A WEE BIT SMALL.



---

## TRINA:
THIS GIRL AGREES.




---

## MENDEL and JASON:
ADIEU.



---

## TRINA:
I’LL WAIT OUTSIDE AND HOLD THE FOOD.



---

## MENDEL:
I DO NOT EAT AT ALL IN TIMES LIKE THESE.



---

## TRINA:
THE WORST IS THROUGH.



---

## MENDEL:
THERE’S WORK TO DO.



---

## TRINA:
I’LL WAIT.



---

## MENDEL:
SHE’LL WAIT.



---

## JASON:
THEY’LL WAIT.



---

## TRINA:
I’LL WAIT FOR YOU.



---

## JASON:
MR. MENDEL, I GET APOPLEXY THINKING OF MY FATHER. I RESEMBLE HIM IN FAR TOO MANY WAYS.

HIS SAD DEMEANOR, THE WAY HE ACTS THE SWINE; AT LEAST HIS ROOM IS CLEANER THAN MINE. IS IT FATAL?

DO YOU SEE REAL SIMILARITIES BETWEEN US? HE AND WHIZZER LIVE LIKE…

WELL, I THINK IT’S CLEAR.

WHADDO I DO?

WHADDO I SAY?

HOW DO I ASK?

WHADDO I HOPE FOR?

IS IT IN MY MIND?

LOVE ISN’T FREE.

LOVE ISN’T BLIND.

WHADDO I SEE?



---

## MENDEL:
STOP.

LOOK AROUND YOU.

NO ONE’S SCREAMING AT YOU, SO YOU FEEL ALL RIGHT FOR ABOUT TEN MINUTES. IF YOU FEEL ALL RIGHT FOR ABOUT TEN MINUTES, FEEL ALL RIGHT FOR TWENTY MINUTES?

FEEL ALL RIGHT FOR FORTY MINUTES?

DROP IT AND SMILE.

WHY DON’T YOU FEEL ALL RIGHT FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE?

WHY DON’T YOU FEEL ALL RIGHT FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE?

WHY DON’T YOU FEEL ALL RIGHT FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE?



---

## JASON:
Is this therapy?



---

## TRINA:
CHOP CHOP CHOP CHOP CHOP I CHOPPED IT.

IT’S A GOURMET VERSION OF CHICKEN MARENGO. TOOK ME ALL DAY.

I’LL SAY ‘TWAS WORTH THE TIME.

I LIE.



---

## MARVIN:
WHY IS HE ALWAYS HERE?



---

## WHIZZER:
THE PSYCHIATRIST RETURNING, RETURNING.

FIVE SESSIONS LATER.



---

## MENDEL:
TRY TO FORGET ALL THINGS HOMELY. TRY TO FORGET ALL THINGS SNIDE. NOTHING’S AS GOOD AS YOU RECALL. COUNT WHAT’S GOOD. THEN DIVIDE. IF YOU COUNT, IT’S ALL RIGHT.

YOU CAN FIGURE OUT THE WORLD. YOU CAN ADD AND SUBTRACT AT WILL. YOU CAN COVER UP THE PAST.

YOU CAN KILL THE PAIN VERY EASILY.



---

## JASON:
IS THIS THERAPY?




---

## MARVIN, WHIZZER, MENDEL, and TRINA:
RIGHT, THIS IS THERAPY.



---

## JASON:
So, scram.

MR. MENDEL, AS REGARDING YOUR INTENTIONS TO MY MOTHER. ARE THEY EVERYTHING A WOMAN WOULD DESIRE? HER HAND IS READY.

IT ONLY NEEDS A RING.

I’LL BUY CONFETTI AND SING.

I’M EMBARRASSED.

IT’S NOT MY RESPONSIBILITY TO ASK YOU, BUT I WONDER IF IT’S EVER CROSSED YOUR MIND.



---

## MENDEL:
WHADDO I SAY? WHERE DO I LOOK? WHY DO I LAUGH? HOW DO I ANSWER? IS IT MY MIND? LOVE ISN’T FREE. LOVE ISN’T BLIND. WHADDO I SEE?



---

## JASON:
STOP.

LOOK AROUND YOU.

A LOTTA NICE FURNITURE.

SOMEONE’S BRINGING YOU DINNER. SOMEONE BROUGHT YOU YOUR LUNCH. SOMEONE’S WASHING YOUR LAUNDRY. WASHING YOUR SOCKS.

JESUS CHRIST!

WHY DON’T YOU FEEL ALL RIGHT FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE?

WHY DON’T YOU FEEL ALL RIGHT FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE?



---

## JASON and MENDEL:
WHY DON’CHA [DON’T I] FEEL ALL RIGHT FOR THE REST OF YOUR [MY] LIFE?



---

## ALL:
WHY DON’CHA FEEL ALL RIGHT FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE?

WHY DON’CHA FEEL ALL RIGHT FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE?

WHY DON’CHA FEEL ALL RIGHT FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE?



---

## JASON and MENDEL:
FEEL ALL RIGHT FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE FEEL ALL RIGHT FOR THE

REST OF YOUR LIFE FEEL ALL RIGHT FOR THE

REST OF YOUR LIFE FEEL ALL RIGHT FOR THE

REST OF YOUR LIFE FEEL ALL RIGHT FOR THE

REST OF YOUR REST OF YOUR LI-I-IFE!


MARVIN, WHIZZER and TRINA:
FEEL FEEL FEEL

FEEL FEEL FEEL

FEEL FEEL FEEL

---

## JASON:
This is how you make a marriage proposal.



---

## MENDEL:
I LOVE YOU, DEAR.

I THINK YOU’RE SWELL.

YOU’RE NEVER NEAR ME CLOSE ENOUGH TO TELL IF I’M DELIGHTFUL OR NOT.

I CRAVE YOUR WRIST.

I PRAISE YOUR THIGH.

THERE’S NOT A GUY, THERE’S NOT A PIECE OF PAPER, THERE’S NOT A MAN IN PANTS WHO COULD LOVE YOU THE SAME AS I. OFTENTIMES LOVERS ARE CRAZY PEOPLE.

SOMETIMES THEY KILL EACH OTHER. JUST LIKE A BIBLICAL BROTHER DID TO HIS BIBLICAL BROTHER BACK IN BIBLICAL TIMES.




---

## TRINA, MARVIN, and MENDEL:
Biblical times…



---

## MENDEL:
OH, THOSE BIBLICAL TIMES! I LOVE YOUR EYES.

I LOVE YOUR FACE.

I WANT YOU BY MY SIDE TO TAKE MY PLACE IF I GET SICK OR DETAINED.

DON’T TOUCH YOUR HAIR. YOU’RE PERFECT.



---

## TRINA:
Right.



---

## MENDEL:
DON’T START TO CRY.

THERE’S NOT A GUY, THERE’S NOT A HORSE OR ZEBRA, THERE’S NOT A GIANT MAN, WHO COULD LOVE YOU THE SAME AS I. FORGET THAT GIANT MAN.

HE CAN’T LOVE YOU THE SAME AS I. I’M NOT A GIANT MAN –



---

## TRINA:
Good.



---

## MENDEL:
– BUT I’LL LOVE YOU UNTIL LOVE YOU UNTIL

I DIE.



---

## MARVIN:
WELL, THE SITUATION’S THIS:

DON’T WANT TO CAUSE A STINK.

I DIVORCED MY WIFE, SHE DRIED HER EYES, THEN SHE RAN OFF WITH MY SHRINK.

BUT I WANT A TIGHT-KNIT FAMILY.

I WANT A WIFE WHO KNOWS WHAT LOVE IS. MAYBE SHE DOES.

I’M TOO DAMNED PEEVED, SELF-ABSORBED, SELF-DECEIVED.

WHO KNOWS?



---

## MENDEL:
I SHOULD WORRY WHAT HE SAYS, LIKE HIS WORDS COULD HURT ME WORSE. MARVIN ACTS BEREFT.

MY ACTS OF THEFT ARE INCREDIBLY PERVERSE.



---

## MARVIN:
You said it.



---

## MENDEL:
It’s embarrassing, but

I’VE GOT A NICE TIGHT FAMILY:

SON WITH A BRAIN AND A NICE BRIGHT MOTHER. YES, I FEEL GUILT.

YES, I’M ANNOYED.

SO WAS JUNG.

SO WAS FREUD.



---

## MENDEL:
BUT I, I KNOW YOU’LL COME THROUGH IT IF SO, YOU’LL END LOOKING

RICH.



---

## MARVIN:
I…I CAN’T BELIEVE SHE LOVES YOU. WHY,

I’M SURE SHE CANNOT LOVE YOU.



---

## MARVIN:
BUT NOTHING’S IMPOSSIBLE.



---

## MENDEL:
LOOK WHO’S GOT POW’R.



---

## MARVIN:
KING OF THE LOSERS.



---

## MENDEL:
AT EIGHTY AN HOUR HE CAN BITCH, I CAN STALL.



---

## MARVIN:
I WANT…



---

## MENDEL:
I GOT…



---

## MARVIN:
I WANT…




---

## MARVIN and MENDEL:
…IT ALL.

I’M SURE WE’RE GONNA COME THROUGH IT. NO DOUBT THE BASTARD PREPARES. WE’RE NEEDY AND WANTING.

WE’RE GREEDY AS SWINE.



---

## MENDEL:
I JUST GOT A FAM’LY.



---

## MARVIN:
THE FAM'LY WAS MINE.




---

## MARVIN and MENDEL:
BUT WHO DARES DARES TO BRAWL.



---

## MENDEL:
I GOT IT ALL I GOT IT ALL I GOT IT ALL.



---

## MARVIN:
I WANT IT ALL I WANT IT ALL I WANT IT ALL.



---

## TRINA:

I’M TIRED OF ALL THE HAPPY MEN WHO RULE THE WORLD.

THEY GROW…OF THAT I’M SURE.

THEY GROW…BUT DON’T MATURE.

I’D LIKE THE CHANCE TO HIDE IN THEIR WORLD.

I’M LIST’NING AS THESE MEN WHO AREN’T QUITE MEN YET, BUT AREN’T

BOYS, MAKE NOISE, AND THROW THEIR KNIVES; THEIR TOYS ARE PEOPLE’S LIVES.

THEY FIGHT TOO HARD AND PLAY TOO ROUGH; THEY SOMETIMES LOVE, BUT NOT ENOUGH. MY HEART WILL BEAT AT WILL, BUT STILL…

IT'S CRAZY HOW THEY’RE ACTING AND IT’S CRAZY MY RESPONSE.

AND IT’S STUPID HOW I LOVE THEM, SO DUMB HOW I ANTICIPATE THEIR WANTS.

BUT AS LONG AS THEY AMUSE ME, THAT ALONE IS WHAT’S REQUIRED.

SO I’LL ROAR LIKE I’M WIRED, I’LL EXPLORE WHAT I’M FEELING, EXCEPT WHAT I’M FEELING IS TIRED.

I’M TIRED, SO TIRED OF ALL THE HAPPY MEN WHO RULE THE

WORLD.

HAPPY MEN WHO RULE THE WORLD.

HAPPY, FRIGHTENED MEN WHO RULE THE WORLD. STUPID, CHARMING MEN.

SILLY, CHILDISH JERKS.

THAT SAID, I’LL BE HIS WIFE.

I’LL WED AND CHANGE MY LIFE.

I’LL LAUGH, I’LL SMILE, I’LL WELCOME CHEER; THE TIME IS RIGHT, THE MEN ARE NEAR.

NOW HAPPINESS AND LOVE APPEAR.



---

## FOUR MEN:
MARCH. MARCH.

MARCH OF THE FALSETTOS MARCH OF THE FALSETTOS. WHEE!

WHO IS MAN ENOUGH TO MARCH TO MARCH OF THE FALSETTOS? COME HERE.

ONE FOOT FOLLOWING THE OTHER. TEACH IT TO YOUR BROTHER. MAKE HIM MARCH MARCH MARCH OF THE FALSETTOS MARCH OF THE FALSETTOS.

MARCH A LITTLE BIT MARCH A LITTLE BIT MARCH A LITTLE BIT ON.

FOUR MEN SWAYING IN PHOSPHORESCENCE. KEEP REPLAYING THEIR ADOLESCENCE. FOUR MEN MARCHING BUT NEVER MINCING.

FOUR MEN MARCHING IS SO CONVINCING.

It’s a goddamn surety we’re lacking in maturity.

## MARVIN:

WHO IS MAN ENOUGH TO MARCH TO MARCH OF THE FALSETTOS?




---

## MARVIN and JASON:
ONE FOOT FOLLOWING THE OTHER! PRACTICE IT ON ONE ANOTHER. MARCH. MARCH.

## MENDEL and WHIZZER:
ONE FOOT, OOOH! FOLLOWING THE OTHER! PRACTICE IT ON ONE ANOTHER. MARCH. MARCH.

## WHIZZER and JASON:

## MARVIN AND MENDEL:
MARCH OF THE FALSETTOS

MARCH OF THE FALSETTOS



---

## FOUR MEN:
MARCHING HOME. UH-OH.



---

## TRINA:
PLEASE FORGIVE MY FORMER SPIELING IT DOES NOT CONCERN THE MAN.

AS FOR DOUBTS THAT I’VE BEEN FEELING, I’LL IGNORE THEM WHEN I CAN.

AND THE THINGS THAT I MUST DO.

I’LL DO TO MAKE THIS ALL SUCCEED.

I’LL COMMIT, THAT’S AGREED.

AND WITH WIT AND PRECISION I’VE MADE A DECISION TO GET THE THINGS I NEED, GOD, I’LL TRY, TRY, I’LL CRY.

NO I’LL LAUGH – AND UNAFRAID, I’LL LAUGH – THEN HIRE A MAID.

I’LL FIGHT THE GODS, I’LL FIGHT MY EX, I’LL BEAT THE ODDS AND HAVE GOOD SEX. MY FUTURE’S NOW ON TRIAL.

I SMILE.

## MARVIN:
THAT’S THE KING. TREAT HIM NICE. USE SOME BRAINS; NOW PROTECT HIM.

## WHIZZER:
YES, I KNOW. HERE I GO.

## WHIZZER:
PLEASE DON’T WATCH ME. I CAN DO IT.

## MARVIN:

## WHIZZER:
SHIT. I BLEW IT.

MAYBE YOU COULD SHOW ME WHERE… I FEAR I LOST MY HEAD.



---

## MARVIN:
DO YOU WANT MY HELP?



---

## WHIZZER:
NO, I DON’T.

I CAN THINK IT THROUGH MYSELF.



---

## MARVIN:
START AGAIN. WE’VE SEEN THE WORST.

## WHIZZER:
I’LL GO FIRST.

ROUSLY.

ALL MY RECREATION SEEMS TO SUIT ME OKAY. THESE ARE THE GAMES I PLAY.

IT'S TOUGH WITH LOVE, LOVE’S TOUGH TO SHOW. LET ME FACE THE MUSIC. IT’S A SONG THAT I WAS WAITING TO HEAR SO LONG, SO LONG AGO.

I BET ON THE HORSES.

I DIE BY DEGREE.

I AM SURE HIS DIVORCE IS A TRIBUTE TO ME.

ASK ME IF I LOVE HIM, IT DEPENDS ON THE DAY. THESE ARE THE GAMES I PLAY.

IT'S TOUGH, MY FRIEND, LOVE’S LOOKING STRONG.

PLAY AGAIN THE MUSIC.

IT’S A SONG THAT I’VE BEEN WAITING TO HEAR FOR MUCH TOO LONG.

YEARS, YEARS TOO LONG.

IT HURTS NOT TO LOVE HIM.

IT HURTS WHEN LOVE FADES.

IT’S HARD WHEN PART OF HIM IS OFF PLAYING FAM’LY CHARADES. ASK ME IF I NEED HIM.

GET HIM OUT OF MY WAY:

THESE ARE THESE ARE THE GAMES THESE ARE THE GAMES THESE ARE THE ONLY GAMES I PLAY.

I ONLY WANTED TO SEE

MY FACE IN YOURS.

MY FATHER SAYS THAT LOVE IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING IN THE WORLD. I THINK GIRLS ARE.

I THINK GIRLS ARE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING, NOT LOVE.



---

## MARVIN:
KID, BE MY SON.

WHAT I’VE DONE TO YOU IS ROTTEN.

SAY, I WAS SCARED.

I KEPT MARCHING IN ONE PLACE.

MARCHING IN TIME TO A TUNE I’D FORGOTTEN. I LOVED YOU. I LOVE YOU.

I MEANT NO DISGRACE.

THIS HERE IS LOVE WHEN WE’RE TALKING FACE TO FACE.

FATHER TO SON, I FOR ONE WOULD TAKE LOVE SLOWER. I’VE MADE MY CHOICE.

YOU CAN SING A DIFFERENT SONG. WATCH, AS YOU SING, HOW YOUR VOICE GETS MUCH LOWER. YOU’LL BE, KID, A MAN, KID IF NOTHING GOES WRONG.

## MARVIN:
WHEN HE BATS HE LOOKS GOOD. 


---

## WHIZZER:

JUST REMEMBER HE’S PSYCHOTIC. 


---

## MARVIN:

HE LOOKS DAMN GOOD BUT HE’S CHEAP AS DIRT.



---

## WHIZZER:
EVEN MANIACS CAN CHARM WHICH HE DOES, SO BEWARE.



---

## MARVIN:
AND JUST BE CAREFUL.



---

## WHIZZER:
WHEN HE SMILES THAT SMILE, AVOID HIM, OR ELSE SOUND THE ALERT.

## MARVIN:
So you think there’s hope for the kid?

## JASON:
JUST LOOK AT ME:

I’M A WORLD-CLASS TRAVELER. EACH FRIDAY NIGHT TRAVEL, TRAVEL, TRAVEL FROM HER HOUSE TO HIS HOUSE.

FIRST TAKE THE 104 WITH MY COMPUTER.

I’M JUST A LITTLE KID, NOT A COMMUTER.

AND EACH SUNDAY NIGHT MOTHER COMES TO GET ME AND I HEAR THEM FIGHT.

EV’RYBODY’S YELLING ABOUT THE BAR MITZVAH IT'S NOT A WRESTLING MATCH.

WHY ARE THEY SWEATING?

IT'S NOT A FUNERAL.

WHAT’S SO UPSETTING?

IT'S A CELEBRATION WHERE I GET PRESENTS.

BUT EV’RYBODY’S YELLING AND EV’RYBODY’S RUINING IT.

IT'S A CELEBRATION WHERE I GET RICHER.

BUT EV’RYBODY’S YELLING AND EV’RYBODY’S RUINING IT.

EV’RYBODY’S RUINING IT.

WHY, OH WHY?

WHAT HAVE I DONE THAT THEY’D RUIN MY BAR MITZVAH?



---

## JASON:

## TRINA:
YOU’RE GONNA BLAME ME YOU’VE GOT PAINTING OF DICKS? DON’T TALK TO ME ABOUT TASTE.



---

## JASON:
Stop! I don’t want a bar mitzvah! Okay? I don’t want a bar mitzvah!

## JASON:

I DON’T WANT A BAR MITZVAH,

STUPID BAR MITZVAH, ANY BAR MITZVAH, WOULD YOU?



---

## MENDEL:
EVERYONE HATES HIS PARENTS, THAT’S IN THE TORAH.

IT’S WHAT HISTORY SHOWS.

IN FACT, GOD SAID TO MOSES:

“MOSES, EVERYONE HATES HIS PARENTS. THAT’S HOW IT IS.”

AND GOD KNEW BECAUSE GOD HATED HIS.



---

## MARVIN:
YOU ARE GONNA KILL YOUR MOTHER.

DON’T FEEL GUILTY, KILL YOUR MOTHER.

RATHER THAN HUMILIATE HER, KILLING YOUR MOTHER IS THE MERCIFUL THING TO DO.



---

## TRINA:
JASON, DARLING, DON’T GET NERVOUS. I’M RIGHT HERE AND AT YOUR SERVICE. LOOK, I’M CALM AND SELF-DELUDED. GRATEFUL ‘CAUSE I HOPE YOU’LL DO WHAT I PRAY YOU’LL DO.

RATHER THAN HUMILIATE HER, KILLING YOUR MOTHER IS THE MERCIFUL THING TO DO.



---

## MENDEL:
EV’RYONE HATES HIS PARENTS.

NOW I SEE WHY.

BUT IN TIME THEY’LL COOL OUT, AND YOU’LL THINK THEY WERE ONLY FOOLING.

IT'S A STRANGE THING ‘BOUT PARENTS. PUSH TURNS TO SHOVE WHAT WAS HATE BECOMES MORE OR LESS LOVE.



---

## MARVIN and TRINA:
JASON, PLEASE SEE A PSYCHIATRIST.



---

## MENDEL:
I’M A PSYCHIATRIST. GET LOST.

## MARVIN:
IT’S BEEN HOT, ALSO VERY SWEET.

AND I’M NOT USUALLY DISCREET. BUT WHEN HE SPARKLES, THE EARTH BEGINS TO SWAY. WHAT MORE CAN I SAY?

HOW CAN I EXPRESS HOW CONFUSED AM I BY OUR HAPPINESS? I CAN’T EAT BREAKFAST, I CANNOT TIE MY SHOE.

WHAT MORE CAN I DO?

IF I SAY I LOVE HIM, YOU MIGHT THINK MY WORDS COME CHEAP. LET’S JUST SAY I’M GLAD HE’S MINE AWAKE, ASLEEP.

IT'S BEEN HOT ALSO IT’S BEEN SWELL MORE THAN NOT, IT’S BEEN MORE THAN WORDS CAN TELL. I HALT.

I STAMMER.

I SING A ROUNDELAY. WHAT MORE CAN I SAY?

I’LL STAY CALM. UNTIE MY TONGUE.

AND TRY TO STAY BOTH KIND AND YOUNG.

I WAS TAUGHT NEVER BRAG OR SHOUT.

STILL IT’S HOT, JUST LIKE HOW YOU READ ABOUT.

AND ALSO CARING, AND NEVER TOO UNCOUTH. THAT’S THE SIMPLE TRUTH. THAT’S THE SIMPLE TRUTH.

IF I’M A BITCH WELL, I AM WHAT I AM.

JUST CALL ME DOC.

DON’T CALL ME LADY.

I DON’T LIKE TO TALK WHEN I’M LOSING THE GAME.

BACHELORS ARRIVE SICK AND FRIGHTENED. THEY LEAVE WEEKS LATER, UNENLIGHTENED. WE SEE A TREND, BUT THE TREND HAS NO NAME.

SOMETHING BAD IS HAPPENING. SOMETHING VERY BAD IS HAPPENING. SOMETHING STINKS, SOMETHING IMMORAL, SOMETHING SO BAD THAT WORDS HAVE LOST THEIR MEANING.

RUMORS FLY AND TALES ABOUND. STORIES ECHO UNDERGROUND. SOMETHING BAD IS SPREADING SPREADING SPREADING ROUND.

## WHIZZER:
I CAN’T GO ON ANYMORE.

## MARVIN:
BE A JERK, MY SWEET BRUISER.

TRY TO BE A DECENT LOSER.

AT LEAST YOU COULD GIVE ME THAT.



---

## WHIZZER:
EXCUSE ME, I’M READY TO GO. I’M READY…



---

## MARVIN:
DO YOU KNOW ALL I WANT IS YOU? ANYTHING YOU DO IS ALL RIGHT.

## MENDEL, JASON and WOMEN:

EVERYTHING WILL BE ALL RIGHT. EVERYTHING WILL BE ALL RIGHT. EVERYTHING WILL BE ALL RIGHT

## TRINA:
I WAS SURE GROWING UP I WOULD LIVE THE LIFE MY MOTHER ASSUMED I’D LIVE.

VERY JEWISH, VERY MIDDLE CLASS.

AND VERY STRAIGHT.

WHERE HEALTHY MEN STAYED HEALTHY MEN.

AND MARRIAGES WERE LONG AND GREAT.

I SMILE.

I DON’T COMPLAIN.

I’M TRYING TO KEEP SANE AS THE RULES KEEP CHANGING.

FAMILIES AREN’T WHAT THEY WERE.

THANK GOD THERE’S A HUSBAND AND A CHILD WHOM I ADORE.

BUT THEN THERE’S MORE.

SO MANY MORE.

THERE’S ALWAYS MORE.

LIFE IS NEVER WHAT YOU PLANNED.

LIFE IS MOMENTS YOU CAN’T UNDERSTAND.

AND THAT IS LIFE.

I’M PLAIN.

I DON’T ASTOUND.

I HOLD TO THE GROUND AS THE GROUND KEEPS SHIFTING, KEEPING MY BALANCE SQUARE.

TRYING NOT TO CARE ABOUT THIS MAN WHO MARVIN LOVES.

BUT THAT’S MY LIFE.

HE SHARED MY LIFE.

YES, THAT’S MY LIFE.

LIFE IS NEVER WHAT YOU PLANNED.

LIFE IS MOMENTS YOU CAN’T UNDERSTAND.

AND THAT IS LIFE.

HOLDING TO THE GROUND AS THE GROUND KEEPS SHIFTING.

TRYING TO KEEP SANE AS THE RULES KEEP CHANGING. KEEPING UP MY HEAD AS MY HEART FALLS OUT OF SIGHT.

EVERYTHING WILL BE ALL RIGHT. EVERYTHING WILL BE ALL…

AND WE VOW THAT WE WILL BUY THE FARM ARM IN ARM.

FOUR UNLIKELY LOVERS. WITH HEART.

LET’S BE SCARED TOGETHER. LET’S PRETEND THAT NOTHING


---

## WHIZZER, DR. CHARLOTTE, and CORDELIA:

IS AWFUL. THERE’S NOTHING TO FEAR.

JUST STAY RIGHT HERE. I LOVE YOU.

I LOVE YOU.



---

## MARVIN:
THERE’S NOTHING TO FEAR.

I LOVE YOU.

I LOVE YOU.



---

## MARVIN, WHIZZER, DR. CHARLOTTE, and CORDELIA:
WHO’D HAVE THOUGHT THAT WE FOUR WOULD END UP AS LOVERS?



---

## JASON:
HELLO, GOD.

I DON’T THINK WE’VE EVER REALLY SPOKEN. IF YOU’D KINDLY ALLOW, HOW ABOUT A MIRACLE NOW?

I DON’T KNOW IF YOU EXIST.

I CAN’T HEAR YOUR FINGERS SNAPPIN’. ARE YOU JUST A BIG PSYCHIATRIST?

OR CAN YOU MAKE THINGS NOT HAPPEN? DO THIS FOR ME AND I’LL GET BAR MITZVAHED.

IN EXCHANGE FOR:

COULD YOU PLEASE MAKE MY FRIEND STOP DYING? I AM NOT NIAVE.

IT WON’T BE EASY, BUT IF YOU COULD MAKE MY FRIEND STOP DYING, GOD, THAT’D BE THE MIRACLE OF JUDAISM.

THAT’D BE THE MIRACLE OF JUDAISM.



---

## DR. CHARLOTTE:
SOMETHING BAD IS HAPPENING. SOMETHING VERY BAD IS HAPPENING. SOMETHING THAT KILLS.

SOMETHING INFECTIOUS. SOMETHING THAT SPREADS FROM ONE MAN TO ANOTHER



---

## WHIZZER:
OKAY WHEN THE DOCTOR STARTED USING PHRASES LIKE “YOU’LL PASS AWAY,” WHAT COULD I SAY?

I SAID, DOCTOR, IN PLAIN ENGLISH, TELL ME WHY I WAS CHOSEN, WHY ME OF ALL MEN?

DOCTOR, HERE'S THE GOOD PART:

AT LEAST DEATH MEANS I’LL NEVER BE SCARED ABOUT DYING AGAIN.

LET’S GET ON WITH LIVING WHILE WE CAN AND NOT PLAY DUMB.

DEATH’S GONNA COME.

WHEN IT DOES, SCREW THE NERVES, I’LL BE EATING HORS D’OEUVRES, IT'S THE ROLL OF THE DICE AND NO CRIME, YOU GOTTA DIE SOMETIME.

DEATH IS NOT A FRIEND BUT I HOPE IN THE END, HE TAKES ME IN HIS ARMS AND LETS ME HOLD HIS FACE.

HE HOLDS ME IN HIS ARMS AND WHISPERS SOMETHING FUNNY.

HE LIFTS ME IN HIS ARMS AND TELLS ME TO EMBRACE HIS ATTACK.

THEN THE SCENE TURNS TO BLACK.

LIFE SUCKS.

PEOPLE ALWAYS HATE A LOSER AND THEY HATE LAME DUCKS.

SCREW ME AND SHUCKS.

THAT’S IT.

THAT’S THE BALLGAME.

I DON’T SMOKE, DON’T’ DO DRUGS.

AND THEN COMES THE BAD NEWS.

I QUIT.

THAT’S THE BALLGAME IT'S THE CHINK IN THE ARMOR, THE SHIT IN THE KARMA, THE BLUES.

CAN I KEEP MY COOL DESPITE THE URGE TO FALL APART?

HOW SHOULD I START?

I WOULD CRY IF I COULD.

BUT IT DOES NO DAMN GOOD TO EXPLAIN I’M A MAN IN MY PRIME.

YOU GOTTA DIE SOMETIME.

DEATH’S A FUNNY PAL WITH A WEIRD SORT OF TALENT.

HE PUTS HIS ARMS AROUND MY NECK AND WALKS ME TO THE BED.

HE PINS ME UP AGAINST THE WALL AND KISSES ME LIKE CRAZY.

THE MANY STUPID THINGS I THOUGH ABOUT WITH

DREAD NOW DELIGHT THEN THE SCENE TURNS TO WHITE.

GIVE ME THE BALLS TO ORCHESTRATE A GRACEFUL LEAVE.

THAT’S MY REPRIEVE:

TO GO OUT WITHOUT CARE, MY HEAD HIGH IN THE AIR, IT’S THE LAST LITTLE MOUNTAIN I’LL CLIMB, I’LL CLIMB.

YOU GOTTA DIE SOMETIME.

YOU GOTTA DIE SOMETIME.

YOU GOTTA DIE SOMETIME.

YOU GOTTA DIE SOMETIME, SOMETIME, SOMETIME, SOMETIME, SOMETIME, SOMETIME, SOMETIME, SOMETIME.

WHAT WOULD I DO IF I HAD NOT MET YOU?

WHO WOULD I BLAME MY LIFE ON?

ONCE I WAS TOLD THAT ALL MEN GET WHAT THEY DESERVE. WHO THE HELL THEN THREW THIS CURVE? THERE ARE NO ANSWERS.

BUT WHO WOULD I BE IF YOU HAD NOT BEEN MY FRIEND?

WHERE ARE YOU NOW?

WHO WOULD I BE IF I HAD NOT LOVED YOU?

HOW WOULD I KNOW WHAT LOVE IS?
