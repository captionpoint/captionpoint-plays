## P1: 
Good evening everyone. We are gathered here today to honor the memory of a  wonderful woman. A badass woman! And although this woman’s time on earth was  tragically cut short, we’re here to celebrate her life. Are y’all with me? If y’all are here  for this celebration of life let me hear you say “Hell yeah!” 
Thank you so much. I believe if the dearly departed was here today, she would appreciate all the love that’s in the room right now. Lord rest her soul...

## NIKKI: 
Hi.
That’s me. I’m intelligent, I’m attractive, and my booty is medium-sized but I make up  for it by having big titties. Because balance is important. People like me. Growing up a  nerd sucked as a kid, but as an adult my inability to fit in makes me stand out. People  like me, and they often make the mistake of believing that I’m “cool.” That’s a damn  lie, but I let them run with it. Like all “cool” people, I have lots of followers on social  media and I post pictures of my awesome life doing awesome things all the time. I’m  sexy. I’m confident. I’m well-connected. People like me. Nobody knows how often I  wish I was dead. 
Now, when I say “I wish I was dead” I don’t mean I have some kind of badass self destructive streak that makes me wanna do all the drugs and sex all the penises and go  out in a blaze of glory. 
ADD ECHOES 
Hell naw.

---

## NIKKI: 
What I mean by “I wish I was dead” is I’m living with chronic depression and I literally  want to disappear from the face of earth so that seeing everyone I know be happy  while I act tough and sit at home lonely because I’m too afraid to open up and get hurt  again will be some shit I no longer have to do. 
I have been through some shiiiit... And that shit led to me being among the 1 in 5  Americans who are living with mental health issues right now. Yeah, there are millions  of people walking around pretending that they’re ok when they’re not. And I’m one of  them. 

---

## VIDEO: MONTAGE: PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT DEPRESSION 
You can’t just look at someone and know they have depression. You can’t see  depression, or hear depression, or smell depression… well… I mean there was that one  time when I didn’t shower for a week and after the fact my best friend told me I “smelt  how I felt.” But you know what I mean. Depression and anxiety ain’t no joke. Most  days, I don’t wanna do things, or experience stuff. I don’t wanna wash my ass, I don’t  wanna go to work, I don’t wanna have sex, I don’t wanna see my friends. I don’t even  wanna be here right now. Damn near every day I wake up is a struggle. But that’s all  about to change.

## NIKKI: 
My battle with depression has been drama, man. That’s why I never took the option of  suicide off the table. Has anybody here ever played the game Monopoly? Suicide is  like life’s Get Outta Jail Free card. And to be honest, I think that people who think suicide is selfish are selfish as fuck. 

---

## ECHO 1:
How dare you attempt to end your suffering!

---

## ECHO 2:
Did you even stop to consider how it would affect ME? 

---

## NIKKI: 
Damn. I didn’t mean to hurt you. I guess I’ll just keep waking up to a living hell everyday so that YOU won’t feel sad. 

---

## ECHO 1:
Thank you! 

---

## ECHO 2:
I’m glad I could talk some sense into you. 

---

## NIKKI: 
Personally, the option to kill myself has given me a sense of security, because when I  first started confronting my depression, I did not have an awesome support system. I  had ONE friend who understood, a toxic boyfriend, and a family who was more likely  to cuss me out and try to fight me than to give me a hug.  
I’m not kidding. I have an aunt who is a nurse who almost got into a fistfight in the  hospital twice while my mom was battling cancer-- 

---

## ECHO 1:
Wait… excuse me… Are you serious? 

---

## NIKKI: 
I’m serious. 

---

## ECHO 1:
Really? 

---

## NIKKI: 
Yup. 

---

## ECHO 1:
Really?!?

---

## NIKKI: 
Yup. 

---

## ECHO 1:
Girl! 

---

## NIKKI: 
I know. Like, if ANYBODY should understand why that’s not appropriate, it would  probably be the medical professional, right? Yeah... You see why I don’t really fuck with  my family right? 

---

## VIDEO: 
Now let’s be honest. You can’t tell me that you have never experienced depression.  Even if you are lucky enough to have never been through it yourself, you had to have  encountered somebody dealing with it in your life. 

---

## NIKKI: 
Hey, I’m telling this story here! When I recall my earliest memories of depression, it’s  not the thought of my father staggering through the door late at night and my mom  accusing him of being drunk or high. And it’s not the thought of my mom crying alone  on the living room floor listening to the radio when after she finally left my dad and had  to raise 3 kids on her own. Nah. My earliest memory of depression was when I kinda  sorta dropped outta high school and ran away from home and crossed-dressed for like  3 months so that I could live with my friends and not get caught… I know that sounds  like I was a little asshole but hear me out. 
In order for you to understand why I dropped outta high school, I have to first explain  my relationship with my mother. My momma and I are just alike, we are damn near the  same person. So naturally, that means… 

---

## NIKKI AND ECHOES: 
She ain’t trust me.

---

## NIKKI: 
My mom got pregnant at 15 and married at 16 and was married to my dad for about  20 years. My mother was pretty her entire life. Unlike my mom, when I hit my preteens,  I stopped being cute. And boys made sure I knew it, too. 
I was about 10 years old when my parents split and my mother had to go into hiding to  get away from my dad. Cuz when he was on drugs he would do shit like slash her tires.  So she couldn’t go to work. To provide for his children. Hashtag relationship goals! My  
mom and my siblings and I actually lived in battered women’s shelters for maybe 6  months. Then we moved into an apartment in the… 

---

## NIKKI AND ECHOES: 
HOOD-hood-- 

---

## NIKKI: 
in Chicago. And that was like culture shock for me, cuz I went from having a bougie  two parent home with a swing-set in the backyard to a one parent home where it was  NEVER safe to play outside. My only social life was the afterschool program at my little  brother’s daycare. Several other girls my age were there, and we used to make up  games to entertain ourselves. One of our favorite games at the daycare was one where  we each wrote a love letter to ourselves from whatever famous boy we liked. 
Then we would put the love letters in a pile and read them one by one, and we all had  to guess who wrote the letter. Yes, it was a dumb ass game but we were poor and  there wasn’t no Internet so what the hell else were we gonna do, duh? 
So anyway… I would always lose this game because of my terrible penmanship. But  ONE DAY, I got smart and disguised my handwriting… And I finally won the game.  Yeah… It was a pretty big deal around the daycare. 
After that epic win, I took my love letter home and tucked it into the pocket of my  Talking Mickey Mouse toy, and then completely forgot about it… until the day my  mom found it. 


I remember seeing my mom walk in the house that day to pick me up after a visit with  my granny. Her perfume was breezing throughout the entire kitchen and wearing her  high heels and looking so pretty. She was dealing with a lot of stress and a lot of  pain… but damn it, she hid it well. At that time my mom had never gone to therapy or  read self-help books to heal the trauma she was facing. Nahhh… She did what a lot of  single moms do. She just kept going. 
After my mom settled in and got a big plate of the cabbage and neckbones that my granny had made, she sat beside me and told me she’d cleaned up my room and  found a love letter from a boy. Now, I was legit confused, because boys didn’t like me.  Boys didn’t even wanna sit next to me on the school bus, just in case somebody might  think they liked me. Then my mom told me where she’d found the love letter, and I  laughed. I was like “Nah momma, I wrote that. It was part of a game.” She looked me  in my eyes and said “Nikki, I know you didn’t write it because your handwriting is  atrocious! So tell me the truth or I’m gonna take you outside and whoop your ass.” 

---

## NIKKI: 
“Momma! I’m not popular, boys don’t like me.” 
ADD ECHOS
“Momma! I’m not popular, boys don’t like me. Momma! I’m not popular, boys don’t like me! Momma! I’m not popular, boys don’t  like me! Momma! I’m not popular, boys don’t like me.” 

---

## NIKKI: 
My explanation was interrupted with a smack to the face. 
A punch to the stomach. 
And a push to the ground. 

---

That day, my mom had no intentions of putting me over her knee and spanking me.  This was a beating. My mom didn’t know that by teaching me that its ok for people you  love to hurt you, she was setting me up have fucked up relationships in the future. 
I understand now that my mom thought that by disciplining me this way, she was  preventing me from walking in her shoes of being a young mother stuck in a  bad situation. Of her 3 children, I was the one who reminded her the most of herself.  So my mom didn’t trust me. And with every slap, kick, choke, and pull of my hair that  day, the feeling became mutual. I lied to my mother that night and told her a boy  wrote the love letter just to get her to stop. And it worked. So at 11 years old, I lost all  trust in my mom. 

---

## ECHO 2:
She ain’t trust me. 

---

## NIKKI: 
That lack of trust kept me from telling her the truth when I got raped a year later, she  found out from my school’s principal. 

---

## ECHO 1:
She ain’t trust me. 

---

## NIKKI: 
It kept me from explaining why I stopped wanting to go to church, she beat me one  time because of my choice and that was that.

---

## ECHO 2:
She ain’t trust me. 

---

## NIKKI: 
And ultimately, the lack of trust culminated in me running away from home and  dropping out of high school.

## NIKKI: 
My first experience with “mental health” was nottttt pleasant.  

---

## NIKKI & ECHO 1:
I was 16 years old and was completely anti everything.  

---

## ECHO 1:
I was vegetarian cuz I was anti meat. I was atheist cuz I was anti religion. I cut my  straightened hair off and started growing my dreads cuz I was anti conformity. And I  had recently learned about the atrocities committed during slavery… 

---

## ECHO 1 AND ECHO 2:
So I wasn’t particularly pro-white folks.  

---

## ECHO 2:
We lived in a nice house in the suburbs because my mom was hardworking and  amazing and was able to provide that for us by her damned self. And my dad was back  in my life because he had completely turned his whole life around and was clean and  sober. I was going to a school in the burbs and I hated it. It was white as hell.  

---

## ECHO 1 AND ECHO 2:
And lowkey racisssst! 

---

## ECHO 1:
People used to do passive aggressive shit like put chewed up gum in my textbooks or  start every sentence they said to me with the word “yo.” One semester I got the  highest scores in science class of any kid in my grade and several students approached  me and asked how I was cheating so they could get in on it, too. I was like  

---

## NIKKI AND ECHO 1:
“… Study, bitch.”  

---

## NIKKI: 
And when I told my parents how unhappy I was they didn’t listen. 
So one day, I was in the kitchen making myself some food, thinking random thoughts,  heading into the living room to eat in front of the TV despite the fact that my mom  hated when we did that shit but I didn’t care cuz I was anti mom. And I suddenly had a  revelation. I remembered that I had been molested. By a family member. More than  once. Suddenly a flood of memories came back. 

---

## ANNOUNCER:
Good afternoon, sports fans. This is Iman Denial, bringing you Game 1 of Nikki versus Suppressed Childhood Memories. What a great rivalry. Both teams are coming in with 
great records, can’t wait to see who goes all the way this year. First up to bat we got  Teenage Nikki. And the first pitch of the ball game is the memory of Kindergarten Nikki  getting fondled and then being told to go wash up afterward. Nikki takes a swing,  trying to forget… strike one! Oh, no dice. Suppressed Childhood memories is off to a  hot start. Next up we have the memory of 5-Year-Old Nikki trying to tell her mom but  not knowing how to explain. Oh, that’s the reason Nikki’s parents transferred her to a  new kindergarten. Nikki takes a swing, trying to forget… strike 2! Here comes the last  pitch, the memory of Nikki’s mom finding her doing something inappropriate with one  of her toys…. Ohhh strike 3! The feeling of embarrassment comes back! The shame!  Teenage Nikki remembers! Teenage Nikki remembers! And that’s the ballgame, folks! Suppressed Childhood Memories wins. 

---

## NIKKI: 
I was 16 when I remembered that shit. 
I probably needed therapy. I probably should have told an adult immediately. But  there were none around that I could trust. So the next morning, while my mom and  siblings were sleeping, I packed a garbage bag with clothes, shoes, and art supplies  and I ran away. 
See, at this point I’d become a pro at running away. The first time I’d done it was after  my mom beat me for being friends with a girl who had a baby. I ran to my aunt’s house, but my mom made my father bring me home immediately. The second time I  ran to my friend’s house, but my uncle found me a week later. The third time, though, I  was ready. I lived between several friend’s houses, so nobody could track me down. I  was growing dreads at a time when girls were not rocking that hairstyle, so when I wore  my boyfriend’s clothes I could pass as a boy. That way, cops looking for a missing girl  would look right past me. I lived like that for over 2 months until one of my friends  snitched. And I knowww that going home was best for me… but why am I still mad that  my homey snitched? I’m not kidding. I’m still plotting my revenge on Marvin. 
But anyway… My last day as a runway high school dropout was wild. One moment I  was chilling with my friends, the next moment my family showed up, my dad was there  with a gun, the police came, it was dramaaaa!


The cops arrested me and put me in the back of the car and I was screaming “Don’t  make me go back home! I’ll die if you make me go back!” Yeah… I shouldn’t have said  that. That’s how you end up hospitalized in the psychiatric ward against your will. The  whole next couple months of my life involved me faking like I was taking Zoloft just so I  could get out, just so people would stop analyzing me and just listen.  
See, when it comes to “mental health issues” 


It’s not just our families that have us feeling unheard, it’s the doctors and therapists,  too. After I got discharged, I was legitimately surprised that my mom asked me to  sleep in her bed with her for a few nights. I was surprised that she missed me. Because  I really thought she didn’t like me. I went back to high school, worked my ass off to  graduate on time with an academic scholarship to college not because I wanted to… I  did it because my mom wanted it. And that was when I changed. 
What had being nice and sweet ever got me? Nothing! Being soft wasn’t safe. So... I developed a tough side. I needed to be protected.  
When I tried being nice it left me hurt and disrespected. 
I became a badass to hide the sweet big-hearted chick  
Yeah I’m sensitive. But fuck you nigga, suck my dick.

## NIKKI: 
And the thing that sparked all of this, that memory I was carrying of me being molested  by a loved one just got buried and didn’t come up again until I fell in love, got cheated  on, lost my baby, and lost my damn mind. 
Now would be an excellent time for me to talk to y’all about a little thing called-- 

---

## NIKKI AND ECHOES: 
“Triggers.” 

---

## NIKKI: 
For many of us who have been through awful terrible really bad things, we sometimes  have moments after the fact that remind us of the awful terrible really bad thing we  endured. That psychological reaction to some problematic bullshit is called a trauma  trigger. They can make life hard. I would say they are about 75% of the reason I’ve  always held onto my suicidal Get Outta Jail Free card.


And the thing is, I didn’t used to be this sensitive when it came to guys! After growing  up being… ya know… “funny looking” I kinda came into my own as an adult. I was  living my best life. I was being featured in Billboard, my music was on tv shows and I  was starring in commercials…  

---

## ECHO 1:& 
---

## ECHO 2:
I was finally a big deal OUTSIDE of the day care. 

---

## NIKKI: 
I kinda had my way with the fellas. I remember one dude tried to publicly shame me  because I’d slept with him before. 
Mannn… first of all how is your self-esteem so low that YOU look down on ME for  sexing YOU? And second, if I smashed you hella years ago, you don’t even count. Have  you ever heard of cellular turnover? Every 7 years, every single cell in your body is  replaced. That means I got a whole new vag since we hooked up, bruh. You don’t  count. I fucked you a whole pussy ago. 
Anyway… I was never one to be out here loving these hoes until the day I fell  for my ex. To protect his identity, and keep me from being sued, we’ll just call him  Lucifer the Lord of Fuckboys and Sorrows. Or Luci, for short. 
I THOUGHT THAT YOU WERE SPECIAL.  
THOUGHT YOU WERE SOMETHING GOOD. 
YOU SHOWED ME THAT I MISJUDGED YOU HONEY. 
GUESS I MISUNDERSTOOD. 
YOU TELL ME THAT YOU’VE CHANGED, 
SAYING HOW MUCH YOU’VE GROWN. 
I DON’T BELIEVE IT BABY. HELL NAW. 
DON’T ASK ME WHY I DON’T WANT YOU NIGGA...
GO AND ASK YOUR HOE. WHAT ABOUT YOUR HOE? 
YOU LOVE THEM HOES, YOU LOVE THEM HOES.  
GO AND ASK YOUR HOE. WHAT ABOUT YOUR HOE? 
YOU LOVE THEM HOES, YOU LOVE THEM HOES. 

---

## NIKKI: 
Now, please excuse my candor. I’d hate to give the impression that my sentiments are  rooted in ill-will... ha ha ha! Perish the thought. I was quite taken aback by the behavior  of my partner. Shocked and appalled! At the risk of sounding inelegant... He got me fucked up. 
I COULDN’T SAVE YOU FROM YOU. IF ONLY I HAD KNOWN.  
NOW I DON’T WANT YOU NIGGA. WHY CAN’T YOU LET ME GO?  CAUGHT YOU IN SO MANY LIES NOW I DON’T CARE TO KNOW. I CAN’T BELIEVE YOU BOY. DON’T ASK ME WHY I DON’T WANT YOU NIGGA... 
GO AND ASK YOUR HOE. WHAT ABOUT YOUR HOE? 
YOU LOVE THEM HOES, YOU LOVE THEM HOES. 
GO AND ASK YOUR HOE. WHAT ABOUT YOUR HOE? 
YOU LOVE THEM HOES, YOU LOVE THEM HOES. 

---

## NIKKI: 
Now, I would be remiss if I did not emphasize the extent to which I invested in my  relationship with this gentleman. Imagine my horror upon the realization that my lover  had been untrue. And with women of ill-repute, nonetheless. Ohhh... my beloved. You  must not know bout me. 
YOU THINK I’M COMING BACK. I DON’T KNOW WHAT TO TELL YA. YO MOMMA RAISED A MISTAKE, I CAN’T EXCUSE HER FAILURE. MY MOMMA WARNED ME NOT TO SPOIL YA, IT’S TRUE. 
YOU BOOST A NIGGA EGO NOW HE THINK HE BETTER THAN YOU. AIN’T NOTHING LEFT FOR YOU TO PROVE, STOP TRYING TO HOLD ME NIGGA.  CUZ I WENT THROUGH TOO MUCH SHIT TRYING TO GROW YOU NIGGA. YOU THINK I CAN’T LIVE WITHOUT YOU, I’MA SHOW YOU NIGGA. NOW I’M BACK ON TOP AND YOU WHERE YOU BELONG... BELOW ME NIGGA.
WHAT ABOUT YOUR HOE? 
YOU LOVE THEM HOES, YOU LOVE THEM HOES. 
GO AND ASK YOUR HOE. WHAT ABOUT YOUR HOE? 
YOU LOVE THEM HOES, YOU LOVE THEM HOES.

VIDEO MONTAGE: PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH 

---

## NIKKI: 
When I first met Luci, I didn’t take him seriously. But there’s something about an  unexpected pregnancy that’ll just suck the fun right out of a relationship huh? 

---

## P1: 
Yup! 

---

## NIKKI: 
Now keep in mind, I didn’t trust my mom. So I didn’t tell her. 

---

## ECHOES: 
She ain’t trust me. 

---

## NIKKI: 
I was a whole ass adult with a successful career but still couldn’t trust her enough  to tell her I was pregnant. If I’d told her, she would have told me I didn’t need to rely  on him, because she would be there for me and my baby. She would have pointed out  the fact that the red flags Luci was showing me were actually deal breakers. She would  have told me it wasn’t my fault he kept cheating. She would have came to California to  get me when his ex showed up trying to fight me while I was 6 months pregnant. And  his other side chick showed up crying the next day. She would have told me that it’s  not ok for people you love to hurt you. My mom woulda told me that stress isn’t good  for my baby. But she never got the chance. She didn’t find out about my baby until  after I’d already lost him and attempted suicide. 
I stayed with his dad for 2 years after that, stuck in a codependent emotionally  abusive downward spiral. Abuse thrives in silence. That was when suicide became my  Get Outta Jail Free Card. At that time, every bad thing that had ever happened to me,  I relived it! Every flaw I had, I saw it! Every mistake I ever made, I mourned it! I was a  passenger in my own body, crying in public, screaming barefoot in the street,  financially and emotionally dependent, watching my sanity slip between my fingers like  grains of sand. I was the little girl who was abused by a trusted loved one and was  made to feel responsible for the shame of it! I was the woman, like my mother, who  had forgiven a man for cheating just to have him turn around and do it again! 
I was checking myself into the psyche ward thinking I was the problem while he  was on the phone screaming into my ear that HE had been the one taking care of me,  not no doctors, refusing to say he loved me, and demanding that when I get outta the  psyche ward I show him my credit report. I was the one who kept running back. I was  the one Luci found unconscious after I hung myself, and a few days later he left me  home alone for 6 hours while he took another chick on a date. I was the one who’s man  was taking half naked pictures of women IN MY CLOTHES, in our home, while my  mother was battling cancer. I was the one who was unstable and fragile. I yelled. I  threw shit. I begged him to stop hurting me instead of just leaving. I was reliving my  mother’s relationship with my father! 
I was reliving my mother’s relationship with my father. I was just like her. Every mistake  she ever made with me was an effort to save me from THIS. And now I couldn’t judge  her. Because now I understood her. I was her. The difference is the man I loved only  had to beat my ass once to get me to leave-- 
YOU CHASED ME DOWN TO LET ME DOWN.

---

## NIKKI: 
The klonopin was for my anxiety. The doxepin was for my back pain and to help me  sleep. And the Paxil was for my depression. The fact that I’d attempted suicide meant  they could keep me until they felt I was no longer a threat to myself. And if you refuse  your meds, it takes longer to get out. And trust me, once you were in,  

---

## ECHO 1 AND ECHO 2:
You WANTED to get out. 

---

## NIKKI: 
I wasn’t making no money, I couldn’t afford a fancy ass mental health resort like the  facility my homey who works in finance went to when he needed treatment for  alcoholism. Nah. The state was paying for my broke ass to get help. This hospital was  more like psychiatric jail… but with graham crackers. 
They put me on meds the second day I was in there. In fact, the only time I saw my  psychiatrist was when he was prescribing me meds. There wasn’t no one-on-one  therapy sessions. If we didn’t feel comfortable opening up in group therapy then we  wouldn’t get no help at all. Except for meds. EVERYBODY got meds.

---

## NIKKI AND ECHOES: 
“With a meds meds here and a meds meds there, here a med, there a meds,  everywhere a meds meds…” 

---

## NIKKI: 
And I didn’t wanna take them. But I needed to get better so I could be there for my  momma. So unlike the FIRST time I got hospitalized, this time I was willing to try  anything. Now, I’ve never even smoked weed before so these psychiatric drugs put me  on my ass. I didn’t even know how bad I was reacting to them until my girl Erica told  me I’d been sitting in group therapy moaning out loud, rocking back and forth with a  blanket over my head. 


The doctors told me I needed a “meds adjustment.” And they gave me more days. So  you mean to tell me I’ve been here a week trying to get better so I can take care of my  mom and y’all are giving me meds that are gonna keep me away from her longer? 

---

## NIKKI AND ECHOES: 
Awww hell naw! 

---

## NIKKI: 
So the plan was simple. Everyday after nasty ass lunch, we would be given our medication. When I took mine I  would hide the pills via a process called “cheeking,” which involves depositing the  meds between your gums and your cheek. I would convene with my friends Erica and Megan at the coloring book table after nasty ass lunch. Megan would hand me the  napkin she smuggled upstairs from nasty ass lunch and I would deposit the pills into  the napkin. Then pass the napkin under the coloring book table to Erica, who would  take the pills into her room, flush them down the toilet, and be back in time for group  therapy… And we did the same thing after nasty ass dinner. After organizing all of my fellow psyche ward inmates to write a list of grievances and  formally submit them to the administrator who was the boss of our floor manager, I got  released the next day. 
Now don’t get me wrong, I still wanted to die. But my mom needed me. So I decided I  would be there for my momma til she got better, and THEN I would finally be able to  use my Get Outta Jail Free card. 
That way everybody wins! 
Y’all… My momma wasn’t doing too good. I mean, of course I knew she was a fighter  so she was gonna beat cancer. Of course. But still… I was worried. She’d lost a lot of  weight. Chemo had taken her hair. And she didn’t have the energy to dress up and be  stylish anymore. She was in constant pain and the meds they had her on were so strong  that sometimes they made her feel even worse than her cancer did. My lil brother had  given up his apartment to move back home with her. My big sister had given up her  job to help run my mom’s company. The only one who hadn’t made a real difference  was me. So as my mom started being hospitalized more and more, I realized the one  thing I could do was make sure she was never alone. I spent about 3 months living in  the hospital with my mom.  
It’s funny… my mom wanted so badly to live. And I wanted soooo badly to die. Life is  cruel like that. I found myself wishing I could trade places with her. So she could make  the most out of the life I didn’t want.

## NIKKI: 
Living in the hospital with my mom wasn’t easy. I was so broke that I was scraping  together coins to eat food from the cafeteria. After my ex beat me up, not only was I  hiding my injuries from my family, but hell… when my dead baby’s father beat my ass, I  never went back for my stuff. I couldn’t do it. I left everything behind. Including my  computer. And I couldn’t earn money from a hospital room without it. After my aunt  lied about buying me a new computer it was my best friend Keisha who stepped up  and got one for me. And that was another thing… I hated having to spend so much  time around my family. Now my siblings, my nephews, and half of my hundreds of my  cousins, they’re cool as hell, I love them. But like… my mom is the oldest of 13 kids  and about a half dozen of them fucking suuuck. 

---

## NIKKI AND ECHOES: 
They didn’t give a fuck-- 

---

## NIKKI: 
That I was depressed and suicidal. Instead of being there for my siblings and me, my  aunts and uncles were spreading rumors that I changed my mom’s will and that’s how I  ended up being power of attorney. They tried to turn my big sister against me saying I coerced my mom even though she’d had her will notarized 2 years before she even got  sick. They even said I forged documents and hid the real will all because they thought I  was trying to keep them from getting my mom’s fur coats. Yeah. Fur coats. Did I  mention I’ve been vegan for 20 years? Ain’t no vegans wearing fur, bruh. 
AIN’T NO VEGANS WEARING FUR 
I SAID AIN’T NO VEGANS WEARING FUR 
I MAKE SMOOTHIES MADE OF KALE 
IF I WORE A RABBIT, I’D BURN IN HELL 
OH AIN’T NO VEGANS WEARING FUR 

---

## NIKKI: 
Clap along if you can do it on beat! 
AIN’T NO VEGANS WEARING FUR 
AIN’T NO VEGANS WEARING FUR 
I EAT VEGGIES, FRUITS, AND NUTS 
ALL THE OTHER VEGANS WOULD KICK MY BUTT 
NO AIN’T NO VEGANS WEARING FUR 

---

## NIKKI: 
Despite the stressful ass drama going on, my mom actually made the hospital stay fun  at times. She asked to hear every song I ever made and watched every video I  recorded, telling the nurses  

---

## P1: 
“This is MY baby’s music!” 

---

## NIKKI: 
Had me feeling myself so much that I sent like 15 songs to Spike Lee just in case he  wanted to make me famous. And my mom would watch CSI for hours. At first, I hated  it. Within a week it became my favorite show on television. And my momma would love  telling the same jokes over and over, not to be funny but specifically to embarrass me.  You shoulda heard her lil ass in the hospital talking to my friends Jahmilah and Chris: 

---

## ECHO 2:
“Honeyyy, I knew Nikki was gon be an entertainer. I knew it since she was potty  training. When she was a toddler, whenever we had company she would come into the  living room with her potty, and she would use the pot in front of everybody and she  would stay on that little potty until we clapped. Yesss lawd, I knew my baby was an  entertainer. Nothing she does surprises me.” 

---

## NIKKI: 
But my mom’s favorite thing to bring up in the hospital was this one time when I was a  teenager and we got into an argument, the one time I actually had the balls to talk  back. My mom would look  across the room at me, smile sweetly, and say  

---

## ECHO 1:
"Remember when u were a teenager and u said u didn't wanna be anything like me?  How’s that working out for ya?” 

---

## NIKKI: 
It’s crazy that it took me living with my mom in a hospital for me to realize how much  we have in common. I found out we’d both attempted suicide after losing a baby. Hers  happened before I was born. 

---

## NIKKI AND ECHOES: 
How come we’d never talked about it? 

---

## NIKKI: 
We’d both forgiven a man for cheating only for them to turn around and do it  again. My grandma had done it too.

---

## NIKKI AND ECHOES: 
How come we’d never talked about it? 

---

## NIKKI: 
We’d both been molested by a family member as kids. When she spoke up nobody  believed her either, and that’s why she absolutely believed me. 

---

## NIKKI AND ECHOES: 
How come we’d never talked about it? 

---

## NIKKI: 
When I wear high heels I carry my body weight just like my mom. 

---

## NIKKI: 
When I laugh, I throw my head back just like my mom. 


And in spite of how rocky my childhood had been, she had successfully managed to  instill in me the best parts of herself, the parts that helped me survive the same  hardships she’d endured. And what’s crazy is even in that moment, in constant pain,  fighting for her life she was giving her suicidal daughter a reason to live. She wanted to  live. So I needed to live. Because she needed me to live. So I was gonna live so I could  help her live… and then one day my mom decided she no longer wanted to live. 


That morning the doctors came in early. Hospice. That’s what they call it when you’re  waiting to die. They said it was time. My mom asked if there was anything  more they could do. They said no. I argued with them. She told me to stop. She said  she wanted to die. I told her no. It’s not fair. How come she could just decide to die?


She said no. She was in too much pain. It was time. She asked me to play her favorite  song, this gospel tune called “The Storm is Over.” 
She said she wanted to hug all her loved ones one last time. She said she just  wanted to go home and be with the lord. 
She said she wanted to go home and be with the lord. She said she wanted to go  home and be with the lord. For my last talk with my momma, I hit record.

## NIKKI: 
I had no parents. I had no baby. I had no boyfriend. I had no family. I had no money.  All I had was a world full of no. But I was calm. Because this was it. I just had to make it  til the funeral. After that…. 
I locked myself in my apartment and didn’t eat or drink. I typed the passwords for all of  my accounts in an email and saved it to my drafts to send to my best friend Keisha  when it was time. Keisha had been my rock, a constant source of unconditional love  through the past several years of hell I’d been through. I was glad I would no longer be  her burden. I just laid in bed, counting down the days until my mom’s funeral.  
Day 1 passed. Day 2 passed. Day 3 passed. Day 4 passed. 

---

## NIKKI AND ECHOES: 
On the morning of day 5, my phone rang 

---

## NIKKI: 
“Hello. Can I speak to Nikki Lynette?” This is me. 
“Hello Nikki. This is Spike Lee.” 
….what? 
“This is Spike Lee.” Are you serious? 
He laughed. He was serious. He was calling because he’d listened to the songs I’d sent  that day when I was in the hospital with my mom and he liked one of them so much  that he wanted to put it in his Netflix show. I wanted to be excited. I wanted to speak  myself up and mention that I can act and sell myself... 
But I couldn’t. Instead, I talked to Spike about losing my mom, and how mean my  family had been, and how bad I was feeling. And he listened, and asked questions.  And had compassion. And he told me the same thing my mom told me, that I needed  to get back to my music. I had a song that was gonna be featured in his show and he  wanted me to know he thought the song was awesome.


After that phone call, well…I decided to rethink this whole suicide thing. I mean, why  not just live long enough to see my song on a Spike Lee joint and then go out with a  bang? And in the meantime, maybe I could just make some crazy ass music, have some  unprotected sex, just really live it the fuck up and then go out in a blaze of glory! This  was gonna be the most rational and well thought out suicide ever. 

---

## ECHOES: 
Totally. So rational. So well thought out. 

---

## NIKKI: 
My mom’s funeral was a couple days after that talk with Spike Lee. But the phone call  that actually saved my life came a couple months later when Spike just happened to  call to update me about the song right in the midst of me having a depressive episode.  When he heard the state I was in, he said 

---

## NIKKI: 
“Nikki. The storm is over. Your mom’s not in pain anymore. The storm is over now. You  gotta get back to your music. You have to stop grieving. It’s time for you to put it in  your art.” 

---

## NIKKI AND ECHOES: 
Get back to your music. Put it in your art. 

---

## NIKKI: 
That’s what my mom had said. She played that song called “The Storm is Over.” 

---

## ECHOES: 
The Storm is Over. 

---

## NIKKI: 
--and she told me to get back to my art. And in that moment I felt like my mom was  trying to speak to me through folks in my life. And I realized I couldn’t go on living as two  people, one who was fighting to live in anticipation of good things in the future, and  one who wanted to die because of all I’d lost in the past. I couldn’t be both people  anymore. It was time to use my Get Outta Jail free card. That day I made a decision to  kill the part of myself that was stuck in the past so that the rest of me could live.

---

## NIKKI: ON 
---

## VIDEO: 
You can’t kill me. You need me. You have no identity outside of being sad and  depressed. What, you just gon start acting happy now? 

---

## NIKKI: 
I gotta stop mourning my parents, my baby, my cats, my lost relationship, my lost time.  You won’t let me live so you gotta go. 

---

## NIKKI: ON 
---

## VIDEO: 
You blaming me? You were the one dumb enough to get pregnant and trade your  career in for a nigga who abused you. If you woulda been making money you could  have afforded better care that could have saved your mom’s life. YOU gotta go. 

---

## NIKKI: 
I can’t get that time back but I can make a life worth living and I can’t take you with me.  You gotta go. 

---

## NIKKI: ON 
---

## VIDEO: 
The old you made a life worth living and how did that work out? Be realistic, YOU gotta  go. 

---

## NIKKI: 
That’s what you do. You constantly make me compare myself to how I used to be. No I  can’t get my momma back. I can’t get my child back, I can’t get my time back but I’m  done being stuck in the past. You make me hate myself. You make me feel like I’m not  good enough. You gotta go. I been this way for too long, I can’t go on like this and u  can fight me if u want but you better bring it the fuck on cuz only one of us is gonna  make it out alive!

## NIKKI: 
I have a black cat named Sable now. I got her when she was a kitten. She was the  daughter I always wanted until I came home one day and she had balls and I realized  she was a boy. My romantic life is pretty good, too. I’m getting food, sex, and money  pretty consistently so… you know. I'm living the dream. And I’m looking pretty good  these days, because I follow my mom’s 3 most important beauty tips:

---

## NIKKI AND ECHOES: 
“Drink lots of water, moisturize twice a day, and don’t let no nigga dog you out.” 

---

## NIKKI: 
I’ll never be a role model, u know? I’m a suicide survivor, an abuse survivor, I don’t  wear underwear, I speak openly about sex which women ain’t supposed to do despite  the fact that that’s dumb as hell cuz if women didn’t like sex wouldn’t none of y’all be  here… I’m not a role model. But what I am is a damned good possibility model. I’m  standing here right now because I’m living proof that it’s possible for you or you or you  or YOU to go to the deepest darkest lowest pits of despair and pain and loss and  hopelessness and still get out alive. 
RIGHT…RIGHT…RIGHT…………RIGHT 
THE ONE YOU LOVE MIGHT BE THE ONE TO LET YOU DOWN EVERY TIME. DRY YOUR EYES, YOU DRY YOUR EYES. 
SO JUST BE SURE YOU CAN SURVIVE WITHOUT NO ONE BY YOUR SIDE. 'CAUSE IN LIFE, THE STRONG SURVIVE. 
THE STRONG SURVIVE, THE STRONG SURVIVE, 
THE STRONG SURVIVE, THE STRONG SURVIVE
