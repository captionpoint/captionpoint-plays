CHARACTERS

FREDERICK (m): A productive dreamer, Frederick is youthful in spirit and appearance. He revels in life’s small pleasures, sees possibilities everywhere and is constantly observing. Insatiably imaginative, he takes time for solitude to simply allow his mind to wander. Constantly curious, he looks around the world and wants to know why, and how, it is the way it is.

ERNEST (m): Kindly, wise and a bit of an eccentric with a penchant for gadgets and systems, Ernest is older than the others, and he’s never afraid to share his wisdom.

NELLIE (w): Sweet and sensitive, our “nervous Nellie” is preoccupied with the coming winter and tends to overreact to the smallest of wintry signs. Despite her nervousness, she’s a grounding force within the mouse commune, and she works hard to gently keep her mouse friends on task. Beneath the surface, she’s envious of Frederick.

SUNNY (w): Warm, cooperative and considerate, with seemingly infinite patience, Sunny is eternally optimistic and accepting. She is always on the lookout for fun and adventure.

BABY (m or w, ideally a diminutive female or Baby Huey-like male): The object of the mouse commune’s affection, Baby is completely in tune with the moment. He/she is also really cute and funny, with a healthy dose of moxie. Note: For simplicity’s sake, Baby is referred to as a female throughout the script.

PRODUCTION NOTES

Sets, lighting and sound should be used to help mark the passage of time.

Summer: trees and flowers are in full bloom, warm tones, chirping birds, babbling brooks.

Fall: trees begin to lose their leaves, flowers their bloom.

The lighting turns moodier and cooler, and the sounds a bit more ominous, e.g. a hooting owl, a howling wolf. Winter: the trees are bare, the lighting turns cold, and a winter wind blows.

Spring: the return of spring brings a return of life and color to the stage.

Costumes and makeup should be suggestive.

The size of the sets and props reflects the fact that we are in a mouse’s world: leaves, flowers, ears of corn, etc., are all quite large.

Late Summer (#1: “Opening / It’s a Beautiful Sunny Day”)

AT RISE: A meadow. Happy, summery music.

(It’s early morning. Beautiful light takes the stage along with the sounds of a waking meadow—chirping birds, croaking frogs, crickets, etc.

FREDERICK enters the stage alone, carrying a red poppy flower [like the flower on the original book cover] and taking in the sunrise. He’s the first of his mouse commune to wake.

FREDERICK notices the smell of honeysuckle in the air and the passing of giant, fluffy clouds.

He inhales deeply and exhales with a big smile. He is content. ERNEST enters scribbling furiously on a slate.) FREDERICK. Morning, Ernest!

(ERNEST puts down his slate, picks up his instrument and begins to play, starting off the early morning jam session [a ritual in the mouse community].)

ERNEST. Hiya, Frederick, you’re up early!

FREDERICK. I wanted to capture the first light of this beautiful day!

ERNEST. Come join in!

7 8

Frederick

FREDERICK (his attention caught by a flower or a perfect blade of grass). Oh, I will! In just a moment …

(SUNNY enters skipping, the music having attracted her.)

SUNNY. Morning, Ernest! (Seeing FREDERICK.) Morning, Frederick!

FREDERICK. Hi, Sunny!

ERNEST. Grab your fiddle and join in!

SUNNY. Happy to! (Starting to play.) Frederick, don’t you

want to play with us?

FREDERICK (distracted). Sure I do, Sunny. (Concentrating

on the flower in his hands.) I’ll be there soon …

(NELLIE pops her head up from behind a rock, sniffing the air.)

SUNNY. Nellie! Hurry up and join us! (Pausing to take in the beauty of the day.) Isn’t it a perfect morning?

NELLIE (cautiously). Yes. Quite fine.

(NELLIE enters, picks up her instrument and plays evenly.)

SUNNY (taking issue with NELLIE’s word choice). Quite fine?!

It’s … (Drawing out the word dramatically.) G O R G E O U S. FREDERICK (finally ready to join the group). Yes, gorgeous!

(FREDERICK picks up his instrument and starts to warm up with the band.

BABY enters dragging a burlap blankie. Clearly not a morning mouse, BABY stretches, yawns and does a big bottom scratch. In doing so, the drop seat of BABY’s PJs comes undone.) Frederick

9

FREDERICK (cont’d). Morning, Baby! BABY (stifling another yawn). Morning …

(BABY goes over to the band and grabs a tambourine. But instead of joining in on the jam session, BABY nestles into FREDERICK and falls asleep, using the tambourine as a pillow.)

SUNNY. C’mon, Baby! We need you! Let’s go!

(BABY produces a half-hearted jingle on the tambourine and then falls asleep again.

A bee buzzes by, and a butterfly circles around the mice.)

SUNNY (cont’d). It’s music time!

ALL (ad-libs). Whoo hoo! Let’s go! etc. SUNNY (counting them in). A 1, 2, 3!

(The group starts to play. BABY startles awake.

The group really gets into a groove, with all of the mice playing intensely, until NELLIE puts up her hand and stops the music abruptly.)

NELLIE. Stop! Did you feel that?!

SUNNY. What?

NELLIE. A little breeze, slightly cooler than normal. Coming in from the northeast.

SUNNY. Oh Nellie! Everything’s fine! It’s still summer, don’tcha see?!

(Again SUNNY goes into a fiddle reverie, shorter this time.) 10

Frederick

NELLIE (shaking off her doubts and trying to convince herself).

Yes … summer … late summer … but … still summer.

IT’S A BEAUTIFUL SUNNY DAY …

ERNEST & FREDERICK.

SUNNY DAY!

SUNNY & BABY.

SUNNY DAY!

(The group begins to jam once again.

And once again, NELLIE stops them cold.)

NELLIE. Wait! (Sniffing aggressively.) I smell it! A hint of rosemary and sage!

SUNNY. Nellie, no! The sky is wide-open! A blue canvas!

IT’S A BEAUTIFUL SUNNY DAY!

ERNEST & FREDERICK.

SUNNY DAY!

BABY.

SUNNY DAY!

SUNNY.

NOT A CARE IN THE WORLD NOT A CLOUD IN THE SKY IT’S

ALL.

SUMMER TIME

(They pick up and start jamming again, very briefly.)

NELLIE. Stop! Frederick

11

(The music stops.)

NELLIE (cont’d, shivering). I’m sorry to say it, but I feel a chill in the air. Summer is disappearing, friends. Fall is … (She sniffs again.) nearly here.

SUNNY (attempting to distract NELLIE). No, Nellie. Summer is everywhere! Just look at that bee!

(BABY follows SUNNY. The jam session starts to break down.)

BABY. And look at that flower!

(BABY stoops to smell the flower.)

BABY (cont’d). And … look at that bee on that flower! Uh oh!

(BABY runs from the bee that she’s gotten too close to.)

FREDERICK. A butterfly! Oh, wow!

(Now FREDERICK leaves his instrument to follow the butterfly.

Only ERNEST is left playing, and slightly off-key at that.

FREDERICK follows the butterfly as it flutters around the stage.

BABY and SUNNY chase and are chased by the bee.

Chaos ensues with ERNEST playing his instrument off-key; NELLIE is pacing around the stage nervously; BABY and SUNNY are shrieking with delight and fear as they alternately chase and run from the bee; FREDERICK blissfully chases the butterfly, giggling and making happy sounds.

The butterfly leaves the stage; FREDERICK follows it, exiting. 12

Frederick

A moment later, an enormous, oversized leaf falls from a tree, undulating gently to the ground.

All the mice continue what they are doing, except NELLIE, who stops cold.

While she watches the leaf’s descent, the world closes in around her.

When the leaf finally hits the ground, the world jolts back to life.

NELLIE tries to get everyone’s attention.)

NELLIE. Did you see that, Ernest?! A leaf … a very big leaf …

(ERNEST has set his instrument down and begins making some calculations on his slate.)

ERNEST. Hold on, Nellie.

NELLIE. Sunny! Baby! (Pointing.) A leaf … a very big leaf …

(SUNNY and BABY are still scampering around.)

SUNNY & BABY. Not now, Nellie!

(They run away with a laugh.)

NELLIE. Well, Frederick, then? Did you see it? (She looks around and realizes FREDERICK is gone.) Frederick?! (Determined to get everyone’s attention.) My fellow mice! Don’t you see?! A leaf has fallen. And you know what that means … don’t you? Well, DON’T YOU?!??

(Music starts as mice realize what NELLIE is saying.)

ALL. Fall is here! Frederick

13

(They all talk over each other excitedly saying things like, “Fall is here … It’s here … It’s here,” as they get into position for the song.)

Fall

(The same meadow, but the lighting shifts and takes on a more autumnal tone.)

(#2: “We Got Work to Do”)

NELLIE.

COME GATHER ’ROUND, AND MAKE IT QUICK MY LITTLE MOUSEY CREW! CUZ SUNNY DAYS ARE GETTIN’ SHORT AND WE GOT WORK TO DO!

ALL (except NELLIE, point to her).

WE’RE LUCKY SHE’S THE NERVOUS TYPE!

NELLIE.

THAT’S WHY THEY CALL ME NELLIE!

ALL (except NELLIE).

SHE GATHERS EXTRA CORN AND GRAIN

NELLIE.

TO EXTRA-FILL OUR BELLIES!

ALL.

HEAVE HO, HERE WE GO!

LAZY DAYS ARE THROUGH!

THAT CHILLY WIND IS GONNA BLOW, SO WE GOT WORK TO DO!

ERNEST.

I’M ERNEST AND I KNOW WHAT’S BEST! 14

Frederick

ERNEST (cont’d).

A LEADER HAS TO LEAD!

IT’S TIME TO BUILD OUR WINTER NEST AND WE GOT MOUTHS TO FEED!

SUNNY.

I’M SUNNY AND I’M GLAD TO WORK! I’M ALSO GLAD TO PLAY!

I’M GLAD ABOUT MOST EVERYTHING!!

NELLIE (interrupts SUNNY’s glee).

GO GRAB THAT PILE A’ HAY!

SUNNY.

YAY!

ALL.

HEAVE HO, HERE WE GO!

LAZY DAYS ARE THROUGH!

THAT CHILLY WIND IS GONNA BLOW, SO WE GOT WORK TO DO!

(SUNNY and BABY get progressively more festive as the song goes on: they can’t resist square dancing, which is promptly broken up by NELLIE’s pulling them apart on “Don’t do-si-do!!”)

NELLIE.

FETCH THAT WATER!

(Clap, clap, clap.)

ERNEST.

TOTE THAT WHEAT!

(Clap, clap, clap.) Frederick

15

SUNNY.

WINTER’S COMIN’

(Clap, clap, clap.)

BABY.

AND WE GOTTA EAT!!

(Clap, clap, clap.)

ERNEST.

GATHER THOSE SEEDS UP!

(Clap, clap, clap.)

NELLIE.

DON’T BE SLOW!

(Clap, clap, clap.)

ERNEST.

NO TIME TO SQUARE DANCE!!

(Clap, clap, clap.)

NELLIE.

DON’T DO-SI-DO!!

SUNNY & BABY (disappointed). Ohhh … BABY.

THEY CALL ME LITTLE BABY MOUSE!

I THINK THAT’S JUST BECAUSE I GOT LITTLE EARS AND A LITTLE TAIL AND KINDA LITTLE PAWS …

(Suddenly displays cute, comical toughness.) 16

Frederick

BABY (cont’d).

BUT STAND BACK ALL YOU GROWNUP MICE CUZ I CAN PROMISE YOU THAT I CAN DO MOST ANYTHING WHEN WE GOT WORK TO DO!!

ALL.

HEAVE HO, HERE WE GO!

LAZY DAYS ARE THROUGH!

THAT CHILLY WIND IS GONNA BLOW, SO WE GOT WORK TO DO!

HEAVE HO, HERE WE GO!

LAZY DAYS ARE THROUGH!

THAT CHILLY WIND IS GONNA BLOW, SO WE GOT WORK TO DO!

THAT CHILLY WIND IS GONNA BLOW, SO WE GOT WORK TO DO!

(At the song’s end, more leaves fall from the trees. NELLIE notices and moves to say something to ERNEST, but he anticipates her comment.)

ERNEST. Saw it! (Patting his various empty supply bags and satchels.) Must fill these to the brim if we are going to make it through winter! Sunny, come with me. You can be in charge of berries and straw!

SUNNY. On it!

(SUNNY and ERNEST exit.)

NELLIE. I’ll fill the water barrel! C’mon Baby, grab this seed bag!

(NELLIE exits. Frederick

17

BABY takes a run at the seed bag, thinking she’ll be able to drag it easily behind her. But the weight stops BABY cold. There’s a clownish pull-and-push bit.

The lazzi ends with BABY flying into FREDERICK, who has entered walking backwards, blissfully sniffing the air, feeling the wonder of the beautiful day.)

BABY. Hiya, Frederick! You should watch where you’re going! FREDERICK (gesturing to the air around him). That’s exactly

what I’m doing.

BABY. Huh?

FREDERICK. Watching … observing … absorbing … You

should try it sometime!

BABY. Yeah?

FREDERICK. Yes!

BABY. How do I do all that?

FREDERICK. Well … let’s see. (Thinking.) Take … the sunrise. BABY. Where should I take it?

FREDERICK. No, no, I mean—think about the sunrise. What

do you think of when you think of the sunrise?

BABY (thinks for a moment). Sure is early.

FREDERICK. OK, but what about the … (He wiggles his

paws on his face, indicating the sun light warming him.)

Mmmm! And the … (He makes a wide circle with his

hands as if it’s a burst of color.) Ahhh!

BABY (giggling). You’re funny, Frederick!

FREDERICK (a teeny bit frustrated). Hmm. (Thinking.)

How can I say it? It’s hard to find the words for feelings

sometimes … All right. Let’s try something else …

(A sweet fiddle begins the song, upbeat instrumentation joins in on the first verse. 18

Frederick

FREDERICK’s “wows” are sung with happy reverence.

BABY looks on with amusement.)

(#3: “Wow!”)

(During the song, BABY looks on with reverence, munching on seeds from the seed bag.)

FREDERICK (to BABY).

DIDJA SEE THAT?

DIDJA FEEL THAT?

CAN YOU SMELL THAT BREEZE? FEEL THE WAY THE GRASS IS TICKLING?

HEAR THE BUZZING BEES? EVERYONE SAYS, “HEY THERE FRED’RICK, GET TO WORK!” BUT HOW?

IT JUST SEEMS MORE IMPORTANT TO SAY WOW …

THE FISH ARE FLASHING IN THE STREAM …

I SEE THEM! THEY’RE SHINING!

IT’S LIKE I PAINT THEIR PICTURE IN MY MIND! A BRIGHT RED BERRY IN THE FIELD …

I TASTE IT! DELICIOUS!

I SCOOP UP EVERY MIRACLE I FIND!

WOW …

THE WAY THE BIRDS FLY LIKE THE MILKWEED! WOW …

THE WAY MY FUR WARMS IN THE SUN!

WOW …

THE FEELINGS UNDERNEATH THE BEAUTIFUL! SOMEONE’S GOT TO NOTICE, SO I GUESS I’LL BE THE ONE Frederick

19

TO SAY WOW … JUST WOW …

I KNOW THE WINTER’S COMIN’ CUZ THEY TELL ME! THEY SAY THAT!

BUT I KNOW LOTS OF OTHER THINGS ARE TRUE … SO I COLLECT THE COLORS OF

THE FOREST! THE BARNYARD!

THE TINY SPARKLE IN A DROP OF DEW!

OH WOW …

THE WAY THE MOON SMILES IN THE TREETOPS! WOW …

THE WAY THE LOON SINGS DAY IS DONE WOW …

THE FEELINGS UNDERNEATH THE BEAUTIFUL! SOMEONE’S GOT TO NOTICE, SO I GUESS I’LL BE THE ONE TO SAY WOW …

JUST WOW …

(Spoken.) You see what I mean?

(BABY thinks about it. Then she shrugs and smiles.) BABY. Nope!

NELLIE (offstage). Baby! Where are you?!

(Again, BABY attempts to drag the seed bag. Because of all her munching, the bag is now moveable.)

BABY. Must be fun to daydream all the time!

FREDERICK (amused). Is that what you think I’m doing?

Daydreaming?

(BABY drags the bag slowly across the stage.) 20

Frederick

BABY. All of our friends think so!

NELLIE (offstage). Baby?! Are you coming? BABY. Gotta go!

(BABY picks up the pace and exits with the seed bag.)

FREDERICK (the reality of this misconception hits him).

Daydreaming? That’s what everyone thinks?

(The sound of a mourning dove echoes.

Leaves blow across the stage like tumbleweeds.

A bit disheartened, FREDERICK mopes around the stage. Then he sees a family of ants marching purposefully along a rock.

FREDERICK becomes interested, and his mood lifts.)

FREDERICK (cont’d, to the ants). Ants! Where are you marching off to today? You’re so strong and … and … marchy! Look at you go! (He imitates ants marching.) And listen to you chatter! What are you after there? A yummy crumb? Tasty, I’m sure! What’s that you say, ant? You’ve got to get this tasty crumb to your anthill? You sure work hard. Wow!

(ERNEST, unaware of FREDERICK, enters, dragging yards and yards of blueprints. He starts to unfurl the plans.)

ERNEST (consulting the blueprints). Ahem, yes, well! Let’s see here. (Arranging and rearranging the blueprints, making notes with chalk.) If this thing-a-ma-bob goes here … and this doo-dad goes there … aha! Then this whirly-gig will fit into the widget and the gizmo will attach to the whatcha-ma-callit! Perfect! (He laughs to himself, satisfied.) Frederick

21

(FREDERICK now follows the ants as they make their way across ERNEST’s blueprints.) ERNEST (cont’d, indicating the blueprints that FREDERICK is traipsing on). Ahem, Frederick, do you mind?! FREDERICK. Oh, excuse me, Ernest! But do you see those ants? Look! They’re incredibly strong and very chatty! ERNEST. ANTS? (Rolling his eyes.) Really, Frederick. I’m hard at work on this year’s invention! I can’t reveal the details to you just yet, but, ahem, I can say that … (Gesturing to the blueprints.) … it’s gonna be big!!

(SUNNY and BABY come running in, tripping and slipping and sliding on the blueprints, much to ERNEST’s dismay. SUNNY has several nut and seed bags slung over her shoulder.) ERNEST (cont’d, annoyed). Sunny! Baby!

SUNNY. Sorry, Ernest … exciting news!

BABY. Soooo exciting!

(SUNNY and BABY stand frozen with excitement.) ERNEST. Well … ? Let’s have it!

(SUNNY is so excited and out of breath that she can barely speak.)

SUNNY & BABY (overlapping). I—I— (Gesturing to each other.) We … !

(Beat.)

ERNEST (dead-pan). Go on …

SUNNY. Down by the old barn! 22

Frederick

BABY. The old barn!

SUNNY. Deep in the dirt!

BABY. So deep!

SUNNY. We found a big …

BABY. Big.

SUNNY. Big!

BABY. Big!

SUNNY & BABY. BIG ear of corn!

ALL (ad-lib excited responses). Yay, Sunny! Yay, Baby! Woo-

hoo! Yay!

ERNEST. Fantastic news, Sunny! Wonderful work, Baby! SUNNY. Only problem is, I’m on a seed gathering mission …

(Referring to the seed bags that are weighing her down.)

So I can’t get it. And Baby can’t drag it alone … (Seeing

FREDERICK, who is looking at some recently fallen

leaves.) Frederick!? Can you go with Baby to fetch it?! BABY. Great idea! Let’s go, Frederick!

FREDERICK (looking through the leaves). Hold on, Baby!

(To everyone.) Would you look at these leaves? Have you

ever seen anything so … so …

SUNNY (genuinely curious). So what, Frederick? FREDERICK (sighing). So extraordinary! Such a deep

orange! (Picking up another leaf and handing it to SUNNY.)

And look at this fiery red!

ERNEST. Forget the leaves, Frederick! This is important! We

need to get that ear of corn to our hideaway! It could be just

the thing to get us through the winter.

BABY (trying to leave). Right! What are we waiting for?! FREDERICK (can’t believe what ERNEST has said). Forget

the leaves? Forget them? Ernest, no! We have to remember

them! See how their colors are just so perfect? They won’t

look like this tomorrow. Frederick

23

(BABY and SUNNY look at the leaves in a cute, clumsy way, trying to see what FREDERICK sees. BABY nibbles on one discreetly.)

ERNEST. Frederick! You should be collecting and gathering for the winter. Not playing around with leaves and ants! FREDERICK. But I am collecting and gathering! Don’t you see?

(#4: “Pocket Full of Dust”)

ERNEST (sings professorially).

IF I MAY STATE THE OBVIOUS, IF I MIGHT CLARIFY, WHATEVER YOU’RE GATH’RIN’, FREDERICK, IT FAILS TO MEET THE EYE!

YES IT BEHOOVES US TO BE SMART!

WE LABOR CUZ WE MUST!

GOTTA GATHER UP A WHOLE LOT MORE, MUCH MORE, THAN A POCKET FULLA DUST!

FREDERICK.

WELL, JUST CUZ YOU CAN’T SEE IT DOESN’T MEAN THERE’S NOTHIN’ THERE!

I PROMISE YOU I’M WORKIN’ HARD!

COLLECTIN’ TONS, I SWEAR!

I GUESS IT’S HARD BELIEVIN’, BUT DEAR ERNEST, YOU CAN TRUST THAT I’M GATH’RIN’ UP A WHOLE LOT MORE, MUCH MORE THAN A POCKET FULLA DUST!

SUNNY (optimistically).

CAN WE EAT THESE FINE SUPPLIES? 24

Frederick

FREDERICK.

SORRY, NO CAN DO …

BABY (optimistically).

CAN WE DRINK THEM? BUILD A NEST!?

FREDERICK.

NO, THEY’RE NOT THAT KIND! THESE SUPPLIES ARE DIFF’RENT!

ERNEST (eye roll).

YES, THEY’RE THINGS YOU CAN SEE THROUGH!

FREDERICK.

SOME THINGS AREN’T LIKE ALL THE REST! SOMEDAY, YOU WILL FIND …

SUNNY & BABY (genuinely interested).

FIND WHAT … ?!

FREDERICK.

JUST CUZ YOU CAN’T TOUCH IT DOESN’T MEAN IT ISN’T REAL!

I SWEAR, THE STUFF IS PILIN’ HIGH!!

ERNEST (to BABY and SUNNY, as a kind of warning).

THIS STUFF THAT’S NOT A MEAL!

(Back to FREDERICK.)

YOUR CRAZY THINGS WILL FLY AWAY WITH JUST ONE WINTER GUST!

FREDERICK.

I’M GATH’RIN’ UP A WHOLE LOT MORE, MUCH MORE, THAN A POCKET FULLA DUST! Frederick

25

ERNEST.

GOTTA GATHER UP A WHOLE LOT MORE,

SUNNY & BABY.

MUCH MORE!

ALL (except FREDERICK).

THAN A POCKET FULLA DUST!

(The song ends.

A couple of beats.)

ERNEST. You really could be useful, Frederick; if only you would try.

(ERNEST exits, weighed down by his blueprints. FREDERICK is disheartened, but then BABY turns to him.) BABY. It’s OK, Frederick! I can get that corn all by myself! (Flexing her muscles.) I’ll drag it to our hideaway in no time!

(BABY scampers off. SUNNY approaches FREDERICK.) SUNNY (holding a leaf). May I keep this one? FREDERICK. Of course! They belong to all of us.

(SUNNY starts to leave, her heavy bags in tow.) FREDERICK (cont’d). But, Sunny?

SUNNY. Yes?

FREDERICK (referring to the leaf). Try to keep hold of the

color in your mind. Remember, it won’t look the same

tomorrow.

SUNNY (smiling, wanting to understand him). OK, Frederick.

Thanks. 26

Frederick

(SUNNY exits.

FREDERICK holds the leaves to the light and notices a big puffy cloud go past; he tracks it with his eyes.)

FREDERICK. Oh … wow!

(NELLIE enters and watches FREDERICK watching the cloud. She is perplexed and a bit perturbed. She clears her throat.)

FREDERICK (still watching the cloud, committed to absorbing it). Hi, Nellie! (Pointing.) Take a look at that! (Indicating the cloud.)

(She does.)

FREDERICK (cont’d). What do you see?

(NELLIE takes a moment. Thinks.)

NELLIE. A cloud.

FREDERICK (laughing). Not what do you see … what do

you seeeee?

NELLIE (looks at it a little bit longer and harder). A white cloud? FREDERICK. I see a big, cozy puff of cotton that I could just

sink into for a lonnng nap—ahh!

(FREDERICK sighs contentedly, but his sigh is taken over by an impatient sigh from NELLIE.)

NELLIE (as if to say: “We’ve got work to do”). Uhh!

(FREDERICK takes a break from cloud-watching.)

FREDERICK. Is everything all right, Nellie? You seem … upset. Frederick

27

NELLIE. I am upset. And worried. Very worried. I don’t know if we’ll have enough food to get us through the winter. FREDERICK. Good thing Sunny and Baby found that big ear of corn!

NELLIE. What?! Big ear of corn? That’s the best news I’ve heard all day! Where is it?

FREDERICK. Back behind the barn!

NELLIE. Did they go fetch it?

FREDERICK. Sunny was too busy. So was Ernest. (He returns to cloud-watching.) Baby went for it.

NELLIE. Baby?! But Baby’s not strong enough! Why didn’t you go? You’re … available … far as I can tell! FREDERICK. Oh Nellie! I’m at a very important moment in my supply-collecting. Those clouds will soon turn gray and these leaves will curl and crack. You see, there’s not a lot of time left!

NELLIE. Exactly! That’s what I’m trying to tell you! We need you to get down to the barn and help Baby with that corn! FREDERICK. But what I’m collecting is a little bit different, Nellie. (Frustrated by his inability to articulate it.) It’s, um, it’s hard to explain.

(Beat.)

NELLIE (genuine but frustrated). Try.

FREDERICK. OK … you see … these colors and sounds,

these feelings and smells that I’ve been gathering up all

summer and fall are so … so powerful that even in the

darkest hour of winter, we will have … we will have … NELLIE. We will have what?

FREDERICK. Something special. (Pause, hopeful.) You see? 28

Frederick

(Beat.)

NELLIE. What I see … what I know is that in the darkest hour of winter, we had better have enough corn and seeds and nuts and berries, because food is the only thing that will get us through. (Gathering up her bags.) And now, thanks to our little chat, I’m behind with my collecting for the day. (As she exits.) If you know what’s good for you, Frederick, you’ll go help Baby with that corn!

(NELLIE exits.

The wind picks up, bending the trees and blowing off the last leaves.

There is a change in the lights to cold and gray.

An owl hoots ominously.

FREDERICK stands alone. The stage is silent and desolate for a moment.

FREDERICK hears the honking of geese flying overhead. Looking upward, he follows their path.)

FREDERICK. Oh, wow!

(Still following the geese, FREDERICK ends up behind a tree. BABY enters pushing and dragging an enormous ear of corn. Another gust of wind, and NELLIE blows in, weighed down by a shoulder yoke with two buckets. She does not see FREDERICK or BABY.

In her frenzy to find her friends, NELLIE swings the buckets from her yoke to and fro.)

NELLIE. Ernest? Frederick

29

(NELLIE swings her bucket, and BABY ducks—pleased by the narrow miss.)

NELLIE (cont’d). Sunny!?

(Swing, duck.)

NELLIE (cont’d). BABY MOUSE!? BABY. Present!

(Swing, thwack! BABY is not so lucky on the third swing and

falls to the ground.)

NELLIE. Sorry, Baby! I didn’t see you there!

BABY (dizzy, to NELLIE). It’s OK!

NELLIE. Help me get this water to the hideaway; then I’ll

help you, Baby.

(BABY is huffing and puffing, still struggling with the corn. BABY. Everybody’s. So. Busy. I. Can. Do. It.

NELLIE (dropping her buckets with a thud). Not everybody. BABY. Yes! Everybody!

NELLIE. I wouldn’t call Frederick “busy” exactly.

BABY. Oh sure he is. Gathering … you know … whatever it

is he’s gathering.

NELLIE (a little snort). Gathering? Hmm. I don’t think so. BABY (putting the corn down, pausing to think). Sure he is!

After all, he’s part of the team.

NELLIE (frustrated). Part of the team—my tail! Frederick

thinks only of himself! Frederick is … (Before she can stop

herself.) selfish! 30

Frederick

(BABY gasps and puts her paw to her mouth. FREDERICK, unseen by BABY and NELLIE, also gasps. He peeks out from behind a tree but remains unseen.)

NELLIE (cont’d, shocked at her own word choice but standing by it). Well, he is.

BABY. He is?

NELLIE. Baby, here you are trying to move this big ear of

corn all by your tiny, little self.

BABY (flexing her muscles). Hey!

NELLIE. And where’s Frederick?

BABY. I told you! He’s off doing Frederick things. NELLIE. Well, he should be here helping you! And, yes, I’m

sorry, but that’s selfish. Come on. I’ll help you with this

corn. (Pause.) And the hideaway’s that way. (Pointing in

the direction from which BABY just dragged the corn.) BABY (exasperated by wasted effort). Awww, nuts and berries!!

(NELLIE and BABY exit with the corn, leaving NELLIE’s buckets onstage.

Once gone, FREDERICK emerges from his spot and sits on the grass. He’s melancholy, having overheard what NELLIE said about him.)

FREDERICK (shaking his head in quiet disbelief). Selfish?

(He slumps to the ground and begins bunching up the leaves around him.

When NELLIE returns for her buckets, she sees FREDERICK and slips behind a tree so he won’t see her.

FREDERICK carefully rips at the leaves, occasionally glancing up at the world around him.) Frederick

(#5: “Frederick’s Eyes”)

NELLIE (not seen or heard by FREDERICK).

LOOK AT HIM HE’S LOOKING AT THE CLOUDS AGAIN!

FRED’RICK HARDLY EVER LIFTS A PAW NEVER WORKING, NEVER BUSY LIKE HIS FRIENDS! LAZ’IEST LITTLE MOUSE YOU EVER SAW!

LOOK AT FRED’RICK, ALL HE DOES IS SIT AND

DREAM …

LOOK AT NELLIE, JEALOUS OF HOW NICE THAT

SEEMS …

FIELD MICE SCURRY IMAGINING THE FLURRIES WHEN WINTERTIME IS COMIN’ FAST …

BUT I’M THE MOUSE WHO HURRIES!

CUZ I’M THE MOUSE WHO WORRIES OUR FOOD SUPPLIES WILL NEVER LAST!

SOME MICE ARE CHEERFUL AND SOME NEVER FEARFUL AND ALL OF US STACK THE WOOD …

BUT SOME MICE DREAM LIKE FRED’RICK DREAMS AND SOME MICE WISH WE COULD …

(Her tone changes in the chorus, as she allows herself to “be” FREDERICK for the moment.)

WHAT WOULD I SEE THROUGH FRED’RICK’S EYES?

WONDER HOW THE WORLD WOULD BE? HAPPY AND FREE THROUGH FRED’RICK’S EYES WITH NOTHIN’ EVER WORRYIN’ ME …

(Back to a stern “Nellie sensibility.”)

LOOK AT HIM SMILING! THE CORN HE ISN’T PILING! 32

Frederick

WATCH HIM NOT GATHERING SEEDS!

LOOK AT ME SWEATIN’!

THE FRETTING I AM FRETTIN’!

WHILE FRED’RICK’S PICKIN’ FLOWERS WE DON’T NEED!!

MOST MICE ARE WORKERS!

GOT NO TIME FOR SHIRKERS!

WE LABOR FOR COMMUNITY GOOD!

BUT SOME MICE DREAM LIKE FRED’RICK DREAMS AND SOME MICE WISH WE COULD …

WHAT WOULD I SEE THROUGH FRED’RICK’S EYES?

WONDER HOW THE WORLD WOULD BE? HAPPY AND FREE THROUGH FRED’RICK’S EYES WITH NOTHIN’ EVER WORRYIN’ ME … NOTHIN’ EVER WORRYIN’ ME …

(FREDERICK stretches out the leaves, and we see that it is a chain of paper-doll mice. Five to be exact.

He examines his chain of paper-doll mice a moment, then drops them to the ground, exiting with a little less spring in his step.

NELLIE moves to retrieve the paper-doll chain, hastily tucking it away as ERNEST, SUNNY and BABY quickly enter, assembling at … )

The Meeting Point

(The mice gather to consolidate their supplies and assess their progress.)

ERNEST. Well done, my friends. A good day of collecting and gathering! (Doing some calculations.) This represents exactly half of what we need to get us through the winter. Frederick

33

BABY. Only half?!

(BABY still has one large acorn to contribute, which she proudly drops into a bag.)

BABY. There! Now are we done?

NELLIE. Hardly, Baby. And what’s more, we are behind

schedule. Winter will be here in a couple of weeks. ERNEST. No need to panic. As I said, we have half of what

we need. (Clearing his throat nervously.) According to my

calculations, if every one of us works our very hardest, we

should be able to collect the other half before winter arrives. NELLIE. Every one of us? (Pause, to herself.) Not likely. SUNNY. All it takes is a little team work!

BABY. So, what are we waiting for?! Let’s get back out there!

(A single, giant snowflake drifts slowly to the ground. The mice’s eyes get wide. There is a collective gasp.

Beat.)

ERNEST (referring to the fallen snowflake). But that’s mathematically impossible!

(Beat.)

ALL. Winter’s come early!

NELLIE. We’re not ready! We’re doomed!

(BABY starts to shiver and cry.)

SUNNY. Nellie! Baby! Everything’s going to be just fine!

(Referring to the seed bags.) We have food. We have water. (Dramatically.) We are going to be OK!!! 34

Frederick

NELLIE. But we only have half of what we need. You heard what Ernest said! ERNEST (having a “lightbulb” moment). Perhaps my invention can help pull us through the winter! It just needs to be REvamped and REtooled to REcalculate … (Trying to do the calculations in his head or on his chalkboard slate.) Let’s see … more long, cold, winter days … less food … ack! The machine will figure it out! (Calling behind him on his way out.) Not to worry … I’ll be at the hideaway getting things set up!

(SNOW begins to fall more steadily.

NELLIE and SUNNY gather up several seed bags. BABY is really shivering now.)

NELLIE. We’ve got to get Baby to the hideaway. Sunny, can you take her there?

SUNNY. Sure, Nellie, shouldn’t you come along with us? NELLIE (picking up a couple of stray seeds). I’ll stay out a little longer and stock as many supplies as possible. (Pause.) Every last seed counts now, Sunny.

SUNNY (to BABY, ushering her off). C’mon. Let’s get you to where it’s warm.

BABY (through chattering teeth). But what about Frederick?!

(NELLIE and SUNNY stop cold and look around in vain.) NELLIE (thinking on it). Go on. I’ll keep an eye out for him. BABY. But—butSUNNY. If Nellie can’t find him, Frederick will surely follow

our tracks to the winter hideaway. He’s clever like that … BABY (smiling a little, in admiration). He sure IS clever … Frederick

35

(SUNNY and BABY exit.) SUNNY (while exiting). Let’s go, Baby! See you at the hideaway, Nellie! NELLIE (to herself; looking up at the snow). But the snow will cover up our tracks … (Gravely.) He won’t be able to find his way. (Calling out.) Frederick! Oh, Frederick! (To herself.) Where can you be?!

(NELLIE gathers supplies and looks for FREDERICK for as long as she can, but the snow is coming down hard now. She lifts up the shoulder yolk and heads for the hideaway in the stone wall, exiting.

FREDERICK enters excitedly, as if seeing snow for the first time.)

FREDERICK. Sunny! Baby! Ernest! Nellie!

(FREDERICK looks around for his friends but stops a moment to admire and catch the snowflakes.) FREDERICK (cont’d). I wish they were here—it’s beautiful!

(He gathers some snow and tosses it playfully in the air.) FREDERICK (cont’d). If Nellie could be here now, looking at this beautiful snow with me, then she’d understand. Wouldn’t she? Or would she still think I’m selfish? (Beat.) I know!

(FREDERICK looks around, wanting to collect more supplies.) FREDERICK (cont’d). I’ll just collect more and more of my supplies until they can all see them and feel them like I do! 36

Frederick

(FREDERICK looks up at the sky.)

FREDERICK (cont’d, indicating the snow falling around him). It’s sooo beautiful … (Shivering.) and cold.

Winter

(The hideaway in the stone wall Wind howls.

ERNEST and BABY are getting things set up. SUNNY is peeking through a hole in the wall.)

SUNNY. I think I see Nellie!

BABY. Hooray! Is Frederick with her?

SUNNY (hemming and hawing). Umm … hmmmm …

(The door flings open and in blows NELLIE, along with a burst of snow.

SUNNY and ERNEST help NELLIE, ladened with buckets, inside. Meanwhile, BABY tries to peer around her to see if FREDERICK has arrived.)

SUNNY (cont’d). Nellie! Thank goodness you made it back safe! ERNEST. You were out so long in the cold! But look how much more you gathered!

NELLIE (tentatively). I tried my best …

BABY. Hooray for Nellie! Hooray for Nellie!

(BABY continues looking for FREDERICK.)

SUNNY (unhooking the buckets). Let us help you with those! BABY. Um … Where’s Frederick? Frederick

37

NELLIE (sighing, knowing this question was coming). I looked all over for him. I went to all his favorite places: to the edge of the meadow, and down by the granary, near the brook—which is already frozen by the way …

(They all give a little shudder.)

SUNNY. Oh, he’ll be along. Frederick likes to do things in his own way. He’s probably looking at a snowflake!

BABY. That Frederick!

(SUNNY and BABY give a little chuckle as NELLIE looks nervously through the stones for FREDERICK.

ERNEST sees NELLIE’s anxiety rising and pulls her aside. NELLIE sighs in a worried way.)

ERNEST (to NELLIE). He’ll be along, Nellie. You’ll see … NELLIE. I hope so. But that’s not all I’m worried about! Even with what I brought, we still don’t have enough food to make it until spring.

ERNEST. Stop your fretting! I’ve thought of that! I’ve thought of everything! Conservation is the key! Conservation and ration-i-zation!

BABY (while eating from a seed bag). Ration-i-zation?

What’s that??

ERNEST (taking the bag away from BABY). It means eating only what you need today. So you’ll have some left for tomorrow!

(They all look at BABY, who has managed to pull a nut from her bag, munching on it noisily.)

NELLIE. Easier said than done. 38

Frederick

ERNEST. Aha! That’s where you’re wrong, my friend!

(Gesturing to all the mice.) Gather ’round, everyone! ALL (ad-lib). Yes? What is it, Ernest?

ERNEST. You may have noticed that I’ve been working very

diligently and painstakingly on this year’s invention! ALL (ad-lib). We sure have! Yes! Absolutely!

(ERNEST clears his throat and gestures to the tarp-covered machine.)

ERNEST (cont’d). This may be my finest invention so far!

My most elegant and decadent, my most stream-lined and hard-to-define, my most sys-te-ma-tic and free-of-static … BABY. Show us, Ernest! Show us!

ERNEST. Drum-roll please!

(BABY and SUNNY oblige and drum the floor with their paws.)

ERNEST (cont’d, reaching for the tarp, gathering a bit more suspense). Friends, with the help of my INVENTION, we will have JUST enough food to SQUEAK through the winter! Witness …

(ERNEST whips off the tarp with a flourish.)

ERNEST (cont’d). “The Nut and Seed Ration-ator 5000”!!

(Rapturous applause from SUNNY and BABY, their mouths agape at the sight of ERNEST’s amazing machine.

The machine is a Rube Goldberg-esque concoction of tubes, wires, chutes, pulleys and buckets that connect the supply bins to five bowls labeled “Ernest,” “Nellie,” “Sunny,” “Frederick” and “Baby.”) Frederick

39

BABY. 5000? Wow!

SUNNY (in awe). Sure does sound important!

BABY (sniffing around the machine). Sure does look important! NELLIE. But what does it do?

ERNEST. Ahem … I’m glad you asked …

(He throws a switch to fire up his machine, which rumbles to life.)

(#6: “Bells and Whistles”)

ERNEST (cont’d).

SMART MICE LIKE ME LOVE GADGETRY! COME SEE WHAT I CREATED!

WHY SETTLE JUST FOR SIMPLE THINGS? LET’S MAKE IT COMPLICATED!

THIS PART PICKS UP WHAT THIS THING DROPS WHEN THIS THING SPINS AROUND!

WITH ALL MY GREAT INVENTIONS THERE IS ONE THING THAT I’VE FOUND …

(During the musical breakdown, the machine malfunctions comically.)

ERNEST.

IT’S MAYBE GOT SOME WRINKLES AND SOME VERY MINOR KINKS BUT SCIENCE NEVER BOTHERS CARIN’ WHAT THE PUBLIC THINKS!

I MIGHT WORK ON AN UPGRADE THAT’S THE BEST INVENTION YET! Frederick

41

ERNEST (cont’d).

NELLIE, SUNNY & BABY.

BELLS AND WHISTLES ALL THE WAY!

ALL.

BELLS AND WHISTLES ALL THE WAY! YEAH!

(End of song.

BABY grabs another nut from her bag and starts to munch.) 42

Frederick

BABY (making reference to the malfunctioning machine, while munching on her nut). Don’t worry, Ernest, this way works, too! ERNEST. Hmm. Yes. That’s exactly what we’re trying to avoid. (Fussing with the machine.) Sunny, help me with this, will you?

(SUNNY moves to help ERNEST string rope over a pulley.)

NELLIE. C’mon, Baby. I brought along your toys.

(NELLIE and BABY begin to play.)

Outside the Stone Wall

(FREDERICK enters, shouldering against the stiffening wind.

In contrast to the warm and cozy confines of the stone wall, the outside is cold and bleak.)

FREDERICK. That’s strange. I can’t seem to find any of my supplies out here. Where is everyone? (Realizing he’s lost.) And where am I? (He shivers and looks around some more.) I’m so cold and alone. I can’t even feel my paws or my tail. (Looking around.) Everything is … frozen.

Inside the Stone Wall

(Lights have dimmed, taking some of the warmth out of the stone wall.

SUNNY, ERNEST, NELLIE and BABY are huddled together under blankets, asleep and snoring softly.

They awaken quickly, and comically, as if being startled from a nightmare. They realize they were just dreaming and smile at each other.) Frederick

43

SUNNY (pulling on a woolen hat). Morning, everyone. ERNEST (blowing into his paws, wrapping himself in a scarf).

Morning!

(BABY stretches and scratches in her BABY way.)

BABY (sleepily, pulling on mittens). Morning … SUNNY. That chilly wind is blowing all right! Brrr!

(NELLIE gathers herself in a shawl, chewing nervously on her paw, looking through a hole in the stone wall for FREDERICK.)

NELLIE. Frederick must have been out there all night. I knew the snow would cover our tracks! He’s probably lost! SUNNY (under her breath). Nellie, you’re making everyone

nervous!

(SUNNY, unable to resist the temptation to look herself, nudges NELLIE out of the way and peers through the hole in the wall for any sign of FREDERICK.

SUNNY and NELLIE take turns nudging each other out of the way to look through the hole. ERNEST checks the supply bins against his clipboard.)

BABY. But where is he?

ERNEST. I’m sure Frederick found a warm little nest for the

night. Not to worry!

SUNNY. Yes, Frederick probably found his very own hideaway! ERNEST. Now! We have things to do. I need to make some

repairs to my machine. Nellie, how about bringing me

those nuts and seeds?

BABY. I just wish he would get here … 44

Frederick

SUNNY. Let’s think about something else, Baby. How about a story?

BABY. A story! A story!

SUNNY. Let’s see … Let me think of a good one. Aha! “The

Silly Cat”!

BABY. Hooray!

SUNNY. There once was a silly cat who chased her tail all

day long.

(BABY claps excitedly.)

BABY. Silly!

SUNNY. Oh how she chased that tail! She chased it and chased it. BABY (liking the sounds of the word). Silly! Silly!

SUNNY. And chased it and chased it and chased it!

BABY. Silly! Silly! Silly!

SUNNY. And chased it and chased it and chased it and chased

it …

(ERNEST clears his throat loudly. Clearly annoyed.) SUNNY (cont’d, snapping herself out of it). But then, one

day, the silly cat really wanted to chase something else. BABY (neutral). Oh?

SUNNY. She wanted to chase something new and different … BABY. Uh oh.

SUNNY. She wanted to chase something small and furry and

warm …

BABY. Oh no.

SUNNY. She wanted to chase …

(BABY’s face freezes in fear.) Frederick

45

SUNNY (cont’d). A mouse!

(There is a beat. SUNNY gasps—horrified and surprised at what she’s just said. Everyone looks at BABY and waits for her reaction. Beat. BABY bursts into tears. All move to console her.) NELLIE. Let me try. (Clearing her throat.) “The Foolish Fox”!

(BABY sniffs and snuffles, regaining her composure.) BABY (not completely sold). Hooray.

NELLIE. There once was a foolish fox!

BABY (clapping, a bit more interested). Yay!

NELLIE. And this foolish fox seemed to be hungry all the time. BABY. Yes?

NELLIE. At breakfast time, he ate his breakfast … but he was

still hungry …

BABY. Yes?

NELLIE. So, he ate his lunch, too!

BABY. How foolish!

NELLIE. But when lunch time came, there was no lunch! BABY. Of course.

NELLIE. So, he ate his dinner, too!

BABY. Sooo foolish!

NELLIE. And when dinner time came, there was no dinner! BABY. Of course!

NELLIE. In fact, there was no breakfast, lunch or dinner! BABY (pause). Uh oh.

NELLIE (darker). There was nothing left to eat at all. BABY. Oh no. 46

Frederick

NELLIE. SO … the fox snuck into a nearby hideawayBABY. Oh no, no.

NELLIE. Where some little mice had stored up all their food

for the winterBABY. Oh no, no, no.

NELLIE (unable to stop herself). AND HE ATE IT ALL UP.

EVERY LAST MORSEL. LEAVING NOTHING, JUST

NOTHING FOR THE POOR LITTLE MICE!

(Silence.

Everyone looks at BABY. BABY bursts into tears. All move to console her. NELLIE is bewildered by the turn her story suddenly took.

Once settled, BABY blurts out her next line.)

BABY. I miss Frederick! Even if he is selfish!

ERNEST (clucking his tongue, wiping the tears from BABY’s cheek). Baby! That’s not a word we use in the mouse community. BABY. But that’s what Nellie said about Frederick.

(The group gasps.

Then BABY gasps in reaction to the group’s gasp.)

SUNNY. Nellie, is that true?

NELLIE. Well, yes, I did call him selfish, but only because we

were all doing our fair share and he wasn’t doing anything.

Baby, remember the corn? How you had to do all that work

on your own?

BABY. Yes … But … Frederick makes me laugh!

NELLIE. Well … that may beSUNNY (cutting NELLIE off with her enthusiasm). And

Frederick always has something clever to say! Frederick

47

NELLIE. Well, yes, but he’s always staring down at the ground or up into the sky, or …

ERNEST (jumping in). That’s right—he is! Always so, SO

curious! (Thinking, to himself.) Very inspiring, I must admit.

(Beat.)

NELLIE. I guess I never noticed those things.

SUNNY (gently). Maybe you were so busy looking at the

things he WASN’T doing, that you couldn’t see all the

things he WAS doing.

(Pause.)

BABY (lifting her head up, tearfully). I miss Frederick. SUNNY. He must feel so scared.

ERNEST. And cold.

NELLIE (feeling the worst of all). And alone.

SUNNY. Oh dear.

BABY. Oh dearie dear.

NELLIE. We can’t wait any longer! If he can’t find us, we’ll

have to find him.

ERNEST. But it’s too cold and dangerous out there, Nellie—

snow drifts up to our snouts!

SUNNY. That storm has whipped itself into a frenzy. NELLIE (pause, thinking). This is all my fault for calling him

selfish! I’ll just have to go alone!

(The mice gasp.)

SUNNY. No, Nellie! You’re just starting to thaw out! ERNEST (thinking). I was the first one to our hideaway; I’m the warmest! I should be the one to go out! 48

Frederick

(The mice gasp.)

ERNEST (cont’d). Yes, that settles it! I’ll go!

NELLIE. You can’t go out there! We need you here, Ernest,

to fix the machine!

ERNEST. The machine isn’t what’s important right now. It’s

just ropes and clamps and lights …

(Pause.)

BABY. I know! I know! I’m fast and light and I won’t sink in the snow! So I’ll go!

NELLIE. That’s very sweet of you, Baby, but no. I don’t think so.

(Beat.)

BABY. But … Frederick would do it for us! I know he would. SUNNY (light bulb moment!). Baby’s right! Frederick would

go out in the storm for us! And that’s exactly why not a

single one of us is going out to look for Frederick …

ALL (ad-lib, confusion). But—wait a second … What do you

mean? I’m confused … Didn’t you just say …

SUNNY. Right! You heard me! Not just one of us is going to

look for Frederick … We’re all going to look for Frederick! ALL (ad-lib, getting it). OH! Hooray! Let’s go! OK! We’re

coming, Frederick!

ERNEST. And I know just how we’ll face this storm!

(ERNEST goes over to his machine, and with a flourish, he snaps off a piece and unfurls some rope from one of its pulleys.

Everyone gasps.) Frederick

49

ALL (ad-lib, except ERNEST). Ernest! What are you doing!? Your machine!! ERNEST (quieting the crowd). It’s OK, my friends! These parts might help us to find Frederick … You see? (ERNEST demonstrates by pulling materials from the machine: he ties a rope around himself and straps on a make-shift headlamp.)

ERNEST (cont’d). Hey! Look at that! (Referring to his new rescue get-up.) My machine just might be useful, after all! Come, lend a paw! ALL (ad-lib). Great idea, Ernest! C’mon everybody! Grab this part here! Here’s some rope! Take this clamp! (The mice begin to scrap ERNEST’s machine for parts, gearing themselves up to battle the storm.)

Outside the Stone Wall

(The stage is empty and desolate. FREDERICK sits alone where we last saw him. Snow is piling on him.)

(#7: “The Things I Used to Think”)

FREDERICK (genuine).

WHAT HAPPENED TO MY COLORS? WHERE DID I PUT MY SOUNDS?

THE WORLD FEELS WAY LESS MAGICAL TODAY … I FEEL SO COLD AND LONELY WITHOUT MY FRIENDS AROUND …

IN SNOW THE SMELL OF ROSES BLOWS AWAY …

THE THINGS I FELT AND SAW ARE SLIPPING THROUGH MY PAWS 50

Frederick

FREDERICK (cont’d).

MY FRIENDS ALL GATHER STUFF WHAT I BRING’S NOT ENOUGH! THE MOUSE I USED TO BE JUST DOESN’T FEEL LIKE ME ANYMORE …

MY EYES AND EARS AND NOSE HAVE ALWAYS KEPT ME REALLY BUSY GATH’RING ALL MY BEAUTIFUL SUPPLIES …

BUT NOW I’M LOST AND SCARED, WALKING IN CIRCLES TILL I’M DIZZY AND WHEN I FEEL MY POCKETS I’M SURPRISED … THEY’RE EMPTY …

I THINK I LOST … MY MEMORIES THEY SCATTERED IN THE STORM I SHOULD HAVE BEEN COLLECTING THINGS TO EAT THE OTHER MICE WERE SMARTER THEY’RE SOMEWHERE SAFE AND WARM AND ALL I’VE GOT IS ME WITH FROZEN FEET …

THE THINGS I SAW AND HEARD HAVE FLOWN OFF WITH THE BIRDS THE THINGS I THOUGHT WERE REAL CAN’T REALLY BE … REVEALED … THE THINGS I USED TO THINK AREN’T WHAT I THINK I THINK ANYMORE …

(FREDERICK bunches up the snow around him.

End of song.)

Outside the Wall

(SUNNY, BABY, ERNEST and NELLIE enter, dressed to brave the elements.) Frederick

51

NELLIE. Frederick!!!

BABY. Frederick, where are you? ERNEST. Can you hear us, Frederick?

(SUNNY takes command of the situation, turning on her head lamp.)

(#8: “No Mouse Gets Left Behind”)

(OPTION A: If desired, the cast may employ a call and response moment with the audience.)

SUNNY (to audience). Hey everybody, we’ve gotta find Frederick! Can you help us?

AUDIENCE. Yes!

SUNNY. OK, repeat after me!

(Sung as a slowed-down, plaintive call. The music accompaniment is sparse, even just a few drawn-out fiddle notes.)

NELLIE. Baby, do you see him at the edge of the meadow? BABY (hopeful). I—I— (Resigned.) No.

SUNNY. Ernest, what about down at the granary? ERNEST. That is a negatory, Sunny.

BABY. Nellie, is he near the brook?

NELLIE. I don’t see him!

Inside the Wall

ERNEST (to FREDERICK). Are you all right?

(FREDERICK shakes the snow from himself like a wet puppy.)

SUNNY. Are you hurt? FREDERICK. No. Just cold. SUNNY. Come. We’ll warm you.

(SUNNY and BABY find a burlap bag and wrap FREDERICK in it.

ERNEST hands FREDERICK a nut.)

ERNEST. Here you go.

FREDERICK. Thank you, Ernest. NELLIE. We were so worried about you. BABY. Where were you, Frederick? FREDERICK. I was looking for supplies.

(The other mice look at FREDERICK hopefully.)

NELLIE (gently). There aren’t any supplies to find out there now, Frederick. It’s too late.

(Awkward pause as the other mice realize FREDERICK is empty-handed.)

ERNEST (disappointed but trying to be cheery). Well …

We’re glad you’re here. That’s the important thing! BABY. Frederick is here! Frederick is here!

SUNNY. You always have something delightful to say. How

about you tell us a story? 56

Frederick

BABY (looking at FREDERICK, ready to hang on his every word). Yes, a story from Frederick! A story! A story!

(FREDERICK pats his empty burlap satchel. He opens his mouth, but nothing comes out.)

FREDERICK. I’m sorry, my friends, but I think I’ve lost all my supplies.

SUNNY (sympathetically). Oh, Frederick …

(BABY and SUNNY move to fix the burlap bag, which has slipped from FREDERICK’s shoulders.)

ERNEST. All right … All right … I’ll tell a story.

(BABY stops fussing with the burlap bag and turns to ERNEST, dead-pan.)

BABY. A story from Frederick, yes. (Looking over the rest of them.) A story from any of you … no.

ERNEST. Oh, you’ll like this one, Baby! It’s funny!

BABY (skeptically). OK…

(ERNEST hides behind a rock and pops his paws up to make “rabbit ears.”)

ERNEST. There once was a cranky, old rabbit …

(BABY giggles.)

ERNEST (cont’d, pulling his head up from behind the rock to scold BABY). You can’t laugh yet!

BABY. But I know this story, and you’re right—it is funny! ERNEST. Well, I haven’t gotten to the end! (Going back behind the rock.) One day, this cranky, old rabbit … Frederick

57

(BABY starts to laugh hysterically.)

NELLIE. Baby!!!

SUNNY. Let her laugh. What’s the harm?

ERNEST (again popping his head up from behind the rock).

If she starts laughing now, there’ll be no laughing for later! FREDERICK. But that’s not how laughter works.

ERNEST. That is exactly how laughter works! It doesn’t grow on trees. It must be earned! Now … I’m going to teach you how to enjoy a good story! So! Here we go … (Scrunching down behind the rock and beginning again.) There once was a cranky, old rabbit … (Quickly popping his head up and scolding BABY before she can laugh.) Remember. You must wait for the ending before you laugh!

(BABY settles in to listen.)

ERNEST (cont’d). Now. This rabbit was … actually it may have been a hare. A rabbit or a hare I can’t remember.

(BABY shifts around, clearly losing interest.)

ERNEST (cont’d). In any case it was brown. Brownish red to be exact and the, well the rabbit, or hare, it doesn’t much matter.

(BABY shifts around some more.)

ERNEST (cont’d). This animal—this rodent really—although they never think of themselves that way. So high and mighty are THEY. Rabbits don’t even consider themselves part of the rodent family … (Clearing his throat.) Where was I? NELLIE. This rodent …

ERNEST. This rodent decided to go for a walk one day. A small hop, if you will. 58

Frederick

(BABY’s head nods sleepily.)

ERNEST (cont’d). But! You see! The thing was … he was afraid. Yes! Afraid of his own shadow. And so he ended up back in his own little hole without ever taking a single step. The end!

(There is silence.)

ERNEST (cont’d, popping his head up, looking at BABY). Go on! Laugh. Now you laugh!

(But BABY has fallen asleep.

The wind blows stronger and louder and the mice begin to shiver.)

NELLIE. You see? Baby’s used up all the laughing! SUNNY. Maybe she’s just tired.

NELLIE (continuing her rant). We’ve run out of stories! And

now we’ve run out of … joy!

FREDERICK (a glimmer of his old self). But that’s impossible

… You can’t run out of joy.

(They watch together as the light transitions into the deepest, darkest winter hues.)

(#9: “No One Feels Like Chatting”)

(Throughout the song, a dim light passes over the hideaway as if the rising and setting of several weak winter suns.)

NELLIE.

WHEN FOOD IS GONE AND THE WALL’S GROWN COLD … Frederick

59

WHEN LIGHT FADES FROM THE CRACKS … WHEN CORN IS JUST A MEMORY IT’S TIME TO FACE THE FACTS …

THE GAMES WE PLAY DON’T MAKE US LAUGH AND TALKING IS A CHORE …

CUZ NO ONE FEELS LIKE CHATTING ANYMORE …

YES WINTER IS SUCH A MEAN OLD MAN … MUCH TOUGHER THAN WE KNEW …

THE DAYS TURN INTO FRIGID WEEKS AND WE MIGHT NOT PULL THROUGH …

THEN MONTHS THEY CREEP ON CHILLY FEET TILL WE JUST CAN’T ENDURE …

HOW NO ONE FEELS LIKE CHATTING ANYMORE …

(A ferocious wind blows and starts to make its way through holes in the stone wall.

The wind pushes through, forcing the mice to huddle together wherever they can find warmth.)

SUNNY. I feel … lonely. Even though you are all here. BABY. I sure wish we had something special … something that would make this feeling go away.

ERNEST. This, my friends, is the darkest hour of winter.

(NELLIE overhears this brief exchange. A faint memory of “Frederick’s Eyes” comes to her.)

NELLIE. Wait a minute … darkest hour of winter … something special … ? Frederick, you said that the supplies you’ve been collecting all summer and fall were for the darkest hour of winter. So we would have something special. FREDERICK. I told you, Nellie. I think I lost them. NELLIE. Lost them? 60

Frederick

(NELLIE thinks for a moment.)

NELLIE (cont’d). You say you lost them?

FREDERICK. I think so, yes.

NELLIE. Well if they can be lost, then they can be found

again. Just like we found you!

FREDERICK (a glimmer of hope). I guess …

NELLIE. And if they can be found and then lost, and lost and

then found, then, my goodness, Frederick … they must be real! FREDERICK (thinking about this). They’ve always been real

to me …

NELLIE. Do you think you can find them again? For us? Now? FREDERICK. I can try.

(FREDERICK brightens.

Everyone has been listening carefully to NELLIE and FREDERICK.)

BABY (whispers to SUNNY and ERNEST). Frederick is going to show us his supplies!

NELLIE (gently nudging FREDERICK). Go on …

(FREDERICK climbs to the highest point he can. Moody music and lighting take over the stone wall.) FREDERICK (uncertain). Close your eyes everyone.

(Everyone does.

As FREDERICK speaks, his past confidence begins to surface.)

FREDERICK (cont’d). Listen to the sound of my voice …

I’m bringing you the warmth of the sun. Frederick

61

(He retrieves a golden ray from his pocket and casts it over them.

They are transported to a warmer place.)

FREDERICK (cont’d). Do you feel the golden glow blanketing your cold little feet?

(The lighting begins to warm the stone wall and each mouse in turn. NELLIE begins to feel the warmth, but she doesn’t fully let on. Instead, she watches FREDERICK with a hint of pride.)

SUNNY. Yes, Frederick!

FREDERICK. Do you feel the yellow rays on your fur? ERNEST (shivering). Ohh ho! It almost tickles! FREDERICK. Do you feel the heat of the summer sun?

Warming your very soul … ?

BABY. So cozy!

FREDERICK (his confidence really building). I bring you the

rays of the sun! Warm and yellow … soft and golden …

pure and simple! SUNNY. Lovely! ERNEST. Delightful! BABY. MMMMM …

(FREDERICK stops talking, and again cold light takes over the stone wall.)

NELLIE. What about the colors, Frederick?

(#10: “Four Little Field Mice”)

FREDERICK. Close your eyes … 62

Frederick

(Moody music again takes over.)

ALL (ad-lib). OK, yes, we will, ready!

FREDERICK. Remember the pale yellow wheat swaying in

the late spring breeze …

ALL (swaying one way). Ooooh.

FREDERICK. See the red poppies blooming in the summer

rain!

ALL (swaying the other way). Aaaah …

FREDERICK. And now, picture in your mind the deep purple

of the bush berries … ALL. Mmmmm.

(NELLIE, ERNEST, SUNNY and BABY mime doing a paint stroke across the sky.)

NELLIE (pleading a bit). And the words, Frederick? What about the words?

FREDERICK. I’ll try … Gather ’round.

(The mice huddle together and look up at FREDERICK, who climbs to an even higher place in the stone wall.) FREDERICK (cont’d).

WHO SCATTERS SNOWFLAKES? WHO MELTS THE ICE? WHO SPOILS THE WEATHER? WHO MAKES IT NICE? WHO GROWS THE FOUR-LEAF CLOVERS IN JUNE? WHO DIMS THE DAYLIGHT? WHO LIGHTS THE MOON?

FOUR LITTLE FIELD MICE WHO LIVE IN THE SKY. FOUR LITTLE FIELD MICE … LIKE YOU AND I.

ONE IS THE SPRING MOUSE WHO TURNS ON THE SHOWERS Frederick

63

(SUNNY washes color all over the stone wall with a flourish.)

FREDERICK (cont’d).

THEN COMES THE SUMMER WHO PAINTS IN THE FLOWERS.

(ERNEST does an awkwardly wooden, but endearing, dance of his own.)

FREDERICK (cont’d).

THE FALL MOUSE IS NEXT WITH WALNUTS AND WHEAT.

(NELLIE does a little jig.) FREDERICK (cont’d).

THE WINTER IS LAST WITH … COLD LITTLE FEET.

(BABY does a funny and cheerful little dance of her own. They all dance together as FREDERICK finishes the song.) FREDERICK & NELLIE.

AREN’T WE LUCKY THE SEASONS ARE FOUR? THINK OF A YEAR WITH ONE LESS … OR ONE MORE!

ALL.

AREN’T WE LUCKY THE SEASONS ARE FOUR? THINK OF A YEAR WITH ONE LESS … OR ONE MORE!

BABY. Hey! (Pointing to each mouse and counting.) One, two, three, four, five—five little field mice, Frederick! Including you! 64

Frederick

(The mice begin dancing around but then freeze as a powerful beam of light breaks through a crevice in the stone wall.)

BABY (cont’d). Wait a minute … What’s that??

(The light pushes more powerfully now; it seems to push the rocks aside with its brightness.

NELLIE watches as the bright sun struggles to make its way through the cracks in the stone wall.)

NELLIE. Is it? ERNEST. Could it be? SUNNY. It is! It is! BABY. Spring is here!

(Pause, as the mice recognize the significance of this moment.)

ALL. We made it!!!

BABY. What are we waiting for? SUNNY. Let’s get out there! NELLIE. Come on!

ERNEST. Yippie!

(All exit the hideaway in the stone wall and emerge into … )

Spring

(The outside world.

Snow has melted and there are buds on the trees.

The mournful sounds of winter have been taken over by the chirping of birds. Frederick

65

The mice blink their eyes in the sunlight as they begin to explore the springtime coming to life [ants, bees, butterflies, flowers, etc.].)

BABY (running around). The grass is tickling my paws! SUNNY. Listen to the buzzing bees!

ERNEST. And the stream—it’s sparkling in the sun!

(NELLIE pulls out FREDERICK’s leaf-paper dolls that she had tucked away earlier and presents them to him.)

NELLIE. Frederick, I thought you might want these back.

You’re … an artist.

ERNEST. A poet!

FREDERICK. It was you, my friends, who helped me to

know it.

BABY & SUNNY (hugging FREDERICK’s waist). Frederick! FREDERICK (indicating the hugs that he’s receiving). You

see? There’s no such thing as running out of joy!

(#11: “There’s No Runnin’ Out of Joy”)

ERNEST. The more you use … NELLIE. The more you make!

WHY DID I EVER WORRY?

WHY DID I EVER DOUBT?

THIS THING THAT FRED’RICK ALWAYS KNEW:

THERE’S NO RUNNIN’ OUT OF …

(Big finish.)

ALL.

JOY!!

END OF PLAY MUSIC NOTES

Hello, fellow musicians! Thank you so much for bringing Frederick to life! I wanted to pass on a few musical and emotional notes that don’t appear in the score.

1. “It’s a Beautiful Sunny Day”:

At the top, think of the two-measure phrases by Ernest, Sunny and Nellie as a quick warm up. They’re each just dusting off a country lick. (Yes, Nellie is a bass player. Seems right for a worrier. She holds it all together.) Going into time, it’s peppy, but there’s no real sense of urgency until the next song.

2. “We Got Work to Do”:

This is a call to action! That first cool breeze hits, seemingly out of nowhere. The mice kick it in to gear and immediately start preparing for winter! Think fiddle at the entrance. We meet the cast as they sing lyrics describing themselves. I’ve tried to create parts for all of the faster country songs that simulate a band, so we have the effect of chords, a bass line and a lead instrument commenting on top of the pulse. Think in terms of making all of those elements come out.

3. “Wow!”:

We meet our hero, Frederick. As the mice hustle to get ready for winter, Frederick’s pure experience of wonder in the world overrides everything else. He is pure innocence with the poetic soul of an artist. Think amazement, awe at the top. Take your time with the rolled chords. As the song goes into time, we again have the feeling of a country band playing.

69 4. “Pocket Full of Dust”:

A swing-influenced country song. Ernest, the practical scientist, just doesn’t see the value in Frederick gathering nothing of any “real” use. It’s playful with a bit of a teacherly scold. On the intro, I was thinking of a lap steel playing there.

5. “Frederick’s Eyes”:

The opening is a classic refrain. While being expressive, it’s important to basically stay in time and not drag. The main part of the song has a sassy Dixieland feel. Nellie is alternately venting her frustration and jealousy about Frederick and wistfully longing to be more like him. It’s Nellie’s moment of emotional honesty. In the second verse, in measures 3941, 43-45 and 47-49, experiment with putting a slight bit of emphasis on the right hand chords on beats 2 and 4.

6. “Bells and Whistles”:

Ernest is the organized and scientific leader, in contrast to Frederick, the dreamer. He claims he has solved the problem of storing enough food for the winter by inventing an amazing machine—full of “bells and whistles.” This is meant to be pedal-to-the-metal rockabilly jazz, and can show you off as a player as well as demonstrating how cool Ernest’s machine is! Go for it! In the middle of the song, the machine dies. Play with that moment by possibly slowing up and creating a crash sound, as in the score.

7. “The Things I Used to Think”:

This is Frederick’s moment of self-doubt, his mousie dark night of the soul. He’s been so absorbed in gathering colors, sounds, smells and memories that he hasn’t noticed the weather turning bitterly cold and snowy and that he has been left behind. Dizzy and scared, he realizes that he’s all alone and wonders if he’s been wrong to believe

70 his “supplies” have any worth. I think the piece somewhat plays itself in that the piano tries to follow the emotional arc of the lyrics. In measure 19, the tenutos are accented. I come down dynamically at the end of the bridge and feel that the last verse becomes very tender, somewhat expands, as indicated in measure 31. We come down into the last chorus. Measure 40, as when played earlier in the song, is the “pull on the heart strings” moment that I hope really expresses the poignancy of Frederick’s doubt.

8. “No Mouse Gets Left Behind”:

Here the audience is engaged in a call-and-response with the cast, answering Sunny singing, “Where are you Frederick?” and the other lines in the intro before the song kicks into tempo. The main body of the song is pure Bluegrass. Again, we have an amalgam of a rhythm section, bass and lead instruments. Hopefully, your space allows the cast to go out into the audience, scurrying all over to search for Frederick as the song progresses. Have fun here! Perhaps extend those choruses in the search, or have the audience sing one chorus acapella with hand claps, or alternate kids/adults in the audience singing, or boys/girls, etc.

9. “No One Feels Like Chatting”:

Originally scored for violin, accordion and guitar, this is a stark, Celtic folk song. The mice have hit rock bottom. They’re dispirited in their shelter, out of food and out of hope. The musical task is to balance that mournful expressiveness with keeping in time.

10. “Four Little Field Mice”:

The lyric of this song is the text of Leo Lionni’s lovely poem in the original book set to music. The opening is played under a fair amount of dialogue. It should time out as indicated, but

71 I’ve provided a safety vamp. I think of this as a combination of a gentle waltz with a bit of an anthemic feel as it progresses. Nothing too heavy, it is the song that finally reveals Frederick’s “supplies” are the contribution of beauty, imagination and memory that sustains us all in hard times!

11. “There’s No Running Out of Joy”:

We close the show with a Gospel song. I’ve purposely left out articulations because everyone has their own way of playing this style of music. Keep it bouncy! At the end, after the glissando down to the E octave in the left hand 55, there’s no need to wait in strict time to play that double octave lead in. Just make it feel right to you, musically.

When using the accompaniment CD, there are slight differences from the piano score, but, with the following exceptions, the form is identical:

6. “Bells And Whistles”:

Measures 69 and 60 can be repeated if necessary as the machine breaks down.

8. “No Mouse Gets Left Behind”:

The intro has a only two cues, so there can be flexibility with the audience. This should also happen when playing the piano score. There is a pickup into the first measure of the main body of the song.

10. “Four Little Field Mice”:

There are four additional measures at the top of the song. Omit them when playing solo piano.

I hope that this will all be helpful. Sarah, Suzanne and I send our best wishes and thank you all. Have fun!
