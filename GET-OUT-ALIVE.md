## P1: 
Good evening everyone.

---

We are gathered here today to honor the memory of a  wonderful woman.

---

A badass woman! And although this woman’s time on earth was  tragically cut short, we’re here to celebrate her life.

---

Are y’all with me?

---

If y’all are here  for this celebration of life let me hear you say “Hell yeah!” 
Thank you so much.

---

I believe if the dearly departed was here today, she would appreciate all the love that’s in the room right now.

---

Lord rest her soul.

## NIKKI: 
Hi.

---


That’s me.

---

I’m intelligent, I’m attractive, and my booty is medium-sized but I make up  for it by having big titties.

---

Because balance is important.

---

People like me.

---

Growing up a  nerd sucked as a kid, but as an adult my inability to fit in makes me stand out.

---

People  like me, and they often make the mistake of believing that I’m “cool.” 

---

That’s a damn  lie, but I let them run with it.

---

Like all “cool” people, I have lots of followers on social  media 

---
and I post pictures of my awesome life doing awesome things all the time.

---

I’m  sexy.

---

I’m confident.

---

I’m well-connected.

---

People like me.

---

Nobody knows how often I  wish I was dead.

---


Now, when I say “I wish I was dead” I don’t mean I have some kind of badass self destructive streak

---
 that makes me wanna do all the drugs and sex all the penises and go  out in a blaze of glory.

---


[echoes]

---

Hell naw.

---

## NIKKI: 
What I mean by “I wish I was dead” is I’m living with chronic depression 

---

and I literally  want to disappear from the face of earth 

---

so that seeing everyone I know be happy  while I act tough and sit at home lonely 

---

because I’m too afraid to open up and get hurt  again will be some shit I no longer have to do.

---


I have been through some shiiiit.

---

And that shit led to me being among the 1 in 5  Americans who are living with mental health issues right now.

---

Yeah, there are millions  of people walking around pretending that they’re ok when they’re not.

---

And I’m one of  them.

---


You can’t just look at someone and know they have depression.

---

You can’t see  depression, or hear depression, or smell depression… 

---

well… I mean there was that one  time 

---

when I didn’t shower for a week and after the fact my best friend told me I 

---

“smelt  how I felt.” But you know what I mean.

---

Depression and anxiety ain’t no joke.

---

Most  days, I don’t wanna do things, or experience stuff.

---

I don’t wanna wash my ass, I don’t  wanna go to work, I don’t wanna have sex, I don’t wanna see my friends.

---

I don’t even  wanna be here right now.

---

Damn near every day I wake up is a struggle.

---

But that’s all  about to change.

---

## ECHOES: 
Why?

---

## NIKKI: 
Huh?

---

## ECHOES: 
Why?

---

## NIKKI: 
What?

---

## ECHOES: 
Why?!?

---

## NIKKI: 
Why?

---

Because I decided that since I can’t turn my life around, I’m just gonna end it.

---

You think I wanna be living this way?

---

## NIKKI AND ECHOES: 
Hellll naw.

---

## NIKKI: 
You think I’m about to spend the rest of my life crazy and alone?

---

## NIKKI AND ECHOES: 
Hellll naw.

---

## NIKKI: 
You think I expect somebody else to put up with me when I don’t even wanna do it?

---

## NIKKI AND ECHOES: 
Hellll naw.

---

  SOMETIMES I WONDER WHAT IT’S LIKE TO HAVE A SMILE ON YOUR FACE &nbsp;♪

---

♪&nbsp;WHEN YOU AIN’T HIDING PAIN BEHIND IT THAT YOU’RE TRYING TO ESCAPE&nbsp;♪

## NIKKI: 
My battle with depression has been drama, man.

---

That’s why I never took the option of  suicide off the table.

---

Has anybody here ever played the game Monopoly?

---

Suicide is  like life’s Get Outta Jail Free card.

---

And to be honest, I think that people who think suicide is selfish are selfish as fuck.

---

## ECHO 1:
How dare you attempt to end your suffering!

---

## ECHO 2:
Did you even stop to consider how it would affect ME?

---

## NIKKI: 
Damn.

---

I didn’t mean to hurt you.

---

I guess I’ll just keep waking up to a living hell everyday so that YOU won’t feel sad.

---

## ECHO 1:
Thank you! 

---

## ECHO 2:
I’m glad I could talk some sense into you.

---

## NIKKI: 
Personally, the option to kill myself has given me a sense of security, 

---

because when I  first started confronting my depression, I did not have an awesome support system.

---

I  had ONE friend who understood, a toxic boyfriend, 

---

and a family who was more likely  to cuss me out and try to fight me than to give me a hug.

---


I’m not kidding.

---

I have an aunt who is a nurse who almost got into a fistfight in the  hospital  

---
twice while my mom was battling cancer-- 

---

## ECHO 1:
Wait… excuse me… Are you serious?

---

## NIKKI: 
I’m serious.

---

## ECHO 1:
Really?

---

## NIKKI: 
Yup. ECHO!?

---

## NIKKI: 
Yup.

---

## ECHO 1:
Girl! 

---

## NIKKI: 
I know.

---

Like, if ANYBODY should understand why that’s not appropriate,  

---
it would  probably be the medical professional, right?

---

Yeah.

---

You see why I don’t really fuck with  my family right?

---

## VIDEO: 
Now let’s be honest.

---

You can’t tell me that you have never experienced depression.

---

Even if you are lucky enough to have never been through it yourself,  

---
you had to have  encountered somebody dealing with it in your life.

---

## NIKKI: 
Hey, I’m telling this story here! When I recall my earliest memories of depression,  

---
it’s  not the thought of my father staggering through the door late at night and my mom  accusing him of being drunk or high.

---

And it’s not the thought of my mom crying alone  on the living room floor  

---
listening to the radio when after she finally left my dad and had  to raise 3 kids on her own.

---

Nah.

---

My earliest memory of depression was when I kinda  sorta dropped outta high school  

---
and ran away from home and crossed-dressed for like  3 months so that I could live with my friends and not get caught…  

---
I know that sounds  like I was a little asshole but hear me out.

---


In order for you to understand why I dropped outta high school, I have to first explain  my relationship with my mother.

---

My momma and I are just alike, we are damn near the  same person.

---

So naturally, that means… 

---

## NIKKI AND ECHOES: 
She ain’t trust me.

---

## NIKKI: 
My mom got pregnant at 15 and married at 16 and was married to my dad for about  20 years.

---

My mother was pretty her entire life.

---

Unlike my mom, when I hit my preteens,  I stopped being cute.

---

And boys made sure I knew it, too.

---


I was about 10 years old when my parents split and my mother had to go into hiding to  get away from my dad.

---

Cuz when he was on drugs he would do shit like slash her tires.

---

So she couldn’t go to work.

---

To provide for his children.

---

Hashtag relationship goals!  

---
My
mom and my siblings and I actually lived in battered women’s shelters for maybe 6  months.

---

Then we moved into an apartment in the… 

---

## NIKKI AND ECHOES: 
HOOD-hood-- 

---

## NIKKI: 
in Chicago.

---

And that was like culture shock for me, cuz I went from having a bougie  two parent home  

---
with a swing-set in the backyard to a one parent home where it was  NEVER safe to play outside.

---

My only social life was the afterschool program at my little  brother’s daycare.

---

Several other girls my age were there, and we used to make up  games to entertain ourselves.

---

One of our favorite games at the daycare was one where  we each wrote a love letter to ourselves  

---
from whatever famous boy we liked.

---


Then we would put the love letters in a pile and read them one by one,  

---
and we all had  to guess who wrote the letter.

---

Yes, it was a dumb ass game but we were poor and  there wasn’t no Internet so what the hell else were we gonna do, duh?

---


So anyway… I would always lose this game because of my terrible penmanship.

---

But  ONE DAY, I got smart and disguised my handwriting… And I finally won the game.

---

Yeah… It was a pretty big deal around the daycare.

---


After that epic win, I took my love letter home and tucked it into the pocket of my  Talking Mickey Mouse toy, 

---
 and then completely forgot about it… until the day my  mom found it.

---

I remember seeing my mom walk in the house that day to pick me up after a visit with  my granny.

---

Her perfume was breezing throughout the entire kitchen and wearing her  high heels and looking so pretty.

---

She was dealing with a lot of stress and a lot of  pain… but damn it, she hid it well.

---

At that time my mom had never gone to therapy or  read self-help books to heal the trauma she was facing.

---

Nahhh… She did what a lot of  single moms do.

---

She just kept going.

---


After my mom settled in and got a big plate of the cabbage and neckbones 

---

that my granny had made, she sat beside me and told me she’d cleaned up my room and  found a love letter from a boy.

---

Now, I was legit confused, because boys didn’t like me.

---

Boys didn’t even wanna sit next to me on the school bus, just in case somebody might  think they liked me.

---

Then my mom told me where she’d found the love letter, and I  laughed.

---

I was like “Nah momma, I wrote that.

---

It was part of a game.” 

---

She looked me  in my eyes and said “Nikki, I know you didn’t write it because your handwriting is  atrocious! 

---

So tell me the truth or I’m gonna take you outside and whoop your ass.” 

---

## NIKKI: 
“Momma! I’m not popular, boys don’t like me.”

---

[echoes]

---

“Momma! I’m not popular, boys don’t like me.

---

Momma! I’m not popular, boys don’t like me! Momma! I’m not popular, boys don’t  like me! Momma!  

---
I’m not popular, boys don’t like me.” 

---

## NIKKI: 
My explanation was interrupted with a smack to the face.

---


A punch to the stomach.

---


And a push to the ground.

---

That day, my mom had no intentions of putting me over her knee and spanking me.

---

This was a beating.

---

My mom didn’t know that by teaching me that its ok for people you  love to hurt you, 

---

she was setting me up have fucked up relationships in the future.

---


I understand now that my mom thought that by disciplining me this way, 

---

she was  preventing me from walking in her shoes of being a young mother stuck in a  bad situation.

---

Of her 3 children, I was the one who reminded her the most of herself.

---

So my mom didn’t trust me.

---

And with every slap, kick, choke, and pull of my hair that  day, the feeling became mutual.

---

I lied to my mother that night and told her a boy  wrote the love letter just to get her to stop.

---

And it worked.

---

So at 11 years old, I lost all  trust in my mom.

---

## ECHO 2:
She ain’t trust me.

---

## NIKKI: 
That lack of trust kept me from telling her the truth when I got raped a year later, she  found out from my school’s principal.

---

## ECHO 1:
She ain’t trust me.

---

## NIKKI: 
It kept me from explaining why I stopped wanting to go to church, she beat me one  time because of my choice and that was that.

---

## ECHO 2:
She ain’t trust me.

---

## NIKKI: 
And ultimately, the lack of trust culminated in me running away from home and  dropping out of high school.

## NIKKI: 
My first experience with “mental health” was nottttt pleasant.

---

## NIKKI & ECHO 1:
I was 16 years old and was completely anti everything.

---

## ECHO 1:
I was vegetarian cuz I was anti meat.

---

I was atheist cuz I was anti religion.

---

I cut my  straightened hair off and started growing my dreads cuz I was anti conformity.

---

And I  had recently learned about the atrocities committed during slavery… 

---

## ECHO 1 AND ECHO 2:
So I wasn’t particularly pro-white folks.

---

## ECHO 2:
We lived in a nice house in the suburbs because my mom was hardworking and  amazing 

---

and was able to provide that for us by her damned self.

---

And my dad was back  in my life because he had completely turned his whole life around and was clean and  sober.

---

I was going to a school in the burbs and I hated it.

---

It was white as hell.

---

## ECHO 1 AND ECHO 2:
And lowkey racisssst! 

---

## ECHO 1:
People used to do passive aggressive shit like put chewed up gum in my textbooks  

---
or  start every sentence they said to me with the word “yo.”  

---
One semester I got the  highest scores in science class of any kid in my grade  

---
and several students approached  me and asked how I was cheating so they could get in on it, too.

---

I was like 

---

## NIKKI AND ECHO 1:
“… Study, bitch.” 

---

## NIKKI: 
And when I told my parents how unhappy I was they didn’t listen.

---


So one day, I was in the kitchen making myself some food, thinking random thoughts,  

---

heading into the living room to eat in front of the TV despite the fact that my mom  hated when we did that shit  

---
but I didn’t care cuz I was anti mom.

---

And I suddenly had a  revelation.

---

I remembered that I had been molested.

---

By a family member.

---

More than  once.

---

Suddenly a flood of memories came back.

---

## ANNOUNCER:
Good afternoon, sports fans.

---

This is Iman Denial, bringing you Game 1 of Nikki versus Suppressed Childhood Memories.

---

What a great rivalry.

---

Both teams are coming in with 
great records, 

---
 can’t wait to see who goes all the way this year.

---

First up to bat we got  Teenage Nikki.

---

And the first pitch of the ball game is the memory of Kindergarten Nikki  getting fondled  

---
and then being told to go wash up afterward.

---

Nikki takes a swing,  trying to forget… strike one! Oh, no dice.

---

Suppressed Childhood memories is off to a  hot start.

---

Next up we have the memory of 5-Year-Old Nikki trying to tell her mom but  not knowing how to explain.

---

Oh, that’s the reason Nikki’s parents transferred her to a  new kindergarten.

---

Nikki takes a swing, trying to forget… strike 2! Here comes the last  pitch,  

---
the memory of Nikki’s mom finding her doing something inappropriate with one  of her toys….

---

Ohhh strike 3! The feeling of embarrassment comes back! The shame!  

---

Teenage Nikki remembers! Teenage Nikki remembers! And that’s the ballgame, folks!  

---
Suppressed Childhood Memories wins.

---

## NIKKI: 
I was 16 when I remembered that shit.

---


I probably needed therapy.

---

I probably should have told an adult immediately.

---

But  there were none around that I could trust.

---

So the next morning, while my mom and  siblings were sleeping, 

---

I packed a garbage bag with clothes, shoes, and art supplies  and I ran away.

---


See, at this point I’d become a pro at running away.

---

The first time I’d done it was after  my mom beat me for being friends with a girl who had a baby.

---

I ran to my aunt’s house, but my mom made my father bring me home immediately.

---

The second time I  ran to my friend’s house, but my uncle found me a week later.

---

The third time, though, I  was ready.

---

I lived between several friend’s houses, so nobody could track me down.

---

I  was growing dreads at a time when girls were not rocking that hairstyle,  

---
so when I wore  my boyfriend’s clothes I could pass as a boy.

---

That way, cops looking for a missing girl  would look right past me.

---

I lived like that for over 2 months until one of my friends  snitched.

---

And I knowww that going home was best for me… but why am I still mad that  my homey snitched?

---

I’m not kidding.

---

I’m still plotting my revenge on Marvin.

---


But anyway… My last day as a runway high school dropout was wild.

---

One moment I  was chilling with my friends, the next moment my family showed up, 

---

my dad was there  with a gun, the police came, it was dramaaaa!
---

The cops arrested me and put me in the back of the car and I was screaming 

---

“Don’t  make me go back home! I’ll die if you make me go back!” Yeah… I shouldn’t have said  that.

---

That’s how you end up hospitalized in the psychiatric ward against your will.

---

The  whole next couple months of my life involved me faking like I was taking Zoloft just so I  could get out, 

---

just so people would stop analyzing me and just listen.

---


See, when it comes to “mental health issues” 
---

It’s not just our families that have us feeling unheard, it’s the doctors and therapists,  too.

---

After I got discharged,  

---
I was legitimately surprised that my mom asked me to  sleep in her bed with her for a few nights.

---

I was surprised that she missed me.

---

Because  I really thought she didn’t like me.

---

I went back to high school,  

---
worked my ass off to  graduate on time with an academic scholarship to college not because I wanted to… 

---

I  did it because my mom wanted it.

---

And that was when I changed.

---


What had being nice and sweet ever got me?

---

Nothing! Being soft wasn’t safe.

---

So. I developed a tough side.

---

I needed to be protected.

---


When I tried being nice it left me hurt and disrespected.

---


I became a badass to hide the sweet big-hearted chick  
Yeah I’m sensitive.

---

But fuck you nigga, suck my dick.

---

## NIKKI: 
And the thing that sparked all of this, that memory I was carrying of me being molested  by a loved one just got buried 

---

and didn’t come up again until I fell in love, got cheated  on, lost my baby, and lost my damn mind.

---


Now would be an excellent time for me to talk to y’all about a little thing called-- 

---

## NIKKI AND ECHOES: 
“Triggers.” 

---

## NIKKI: 
For many of us who have been through awful terrible really bad things,  

---
we sometimes  have moments after the fact that remind us of the awful terrible really bad thing we  endured.

---

That psychological reaction to some problematic bullshit is called a trauma  trigger.

---

They can make life hard.

---

I would say they are about 75% of the reason I’ve  always held onto my suicidal Get Outta Jail Free card.

---

And the thing is, I didn’t used to be this sensitive when it came to guys! 

---

After growing  up being… ya know… “funny looking” I kinda came into my own as an adult.

---

I was  living my best life.

---

I was being featured in Billboard, my music was on tv shows and I  was starring in commercials…  

---

## ECHO 1 AND ECHO 2:
I was finally a big deal OUTSIDE of the day care.

---

## NIKKI: 
I kinda had my way with the fellas.

---

I remember one dude tried to publicly shame me  because I’d slept with him before.

---


Mannn… first of all how is your self-esteem so low that YOU look down on ME for  sexing YOU?

---

And second, if I smashed you hella years ago, you don’t even count.

---

Have  you ever heard of cellular turnover?

---

Every 7 years, every single cell in your body is  replaced.

---

That means I got a whole new vag since we hooked up, bruh.

---

You don’t  count.

---

I fucked you a whole pussy ago.

---


Anyway… I was never one to be out here loving these hoes until the day I fell  for my ex.

---

To protect his identity, and keep me from being sued,  

---
we’ll just call him  Lucifer the Lord of Fuckboys and Sorrows.

---

Or Luci, for short.

Now, please excuse my candor.

---

I’d hate to give the impression that my sentiments are  rooted in ill-will.

---

ha ha ha! Perish the thought.

---

I was quite taken aback by the behavior  of my partner.

Shocked and appalled! At the risk of sounding inelegant. He got me fucked up.

---

to which I invested in my  relationship with this gentleman.

Imagine my horror upon the realization that my lover  had been untrue.

---

And with women of ill-repute, nonetheless.

VIDEO MONTAGE: PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH 

---

## NIKKI: 
When I first met Luci, I didn’t take him seriously.

---

But there’s something about an  unexpected pregnancy that’ll just suck the fun right out of a relationship huh?

---

## P1: 
Yup! 

---

## NIKKI: 
Now keep in mind, I didn’t trust my mom.

---

So I didn’t tell her.

---

## ECHOES: 
She ain’t trust me.

---

## NIKKI: 
I was a whole ass adult with a successful career  

---
but still couldn’t trust her enough  to tell her I was pregnant.

---

If I’d told her, she would have told me I didn’t need to rely  on him, 


---

because she would be there for me and my baby.

---

She would have pointed out  the fact that the red flags Luci was showing me were actually deal breakers.

---

She would  have told me it wasn’t my fault he kept cheating.

---

She would have came to California to  get me when his ex showed up  

---
trying to fight me while I was 6 months pregnant.

---

And  his other side chick showed up crying the next day.

---

She would have told me that it’s  not ok for people you love to hurt you.

---

My mom woulda told me that stress isn’t good  for my baby.

---

But she never got the chance.

---

She didn’t find out about my baby until  after I’d already lost him and attempted suicide.

---


I stayed with his dad for 2 years after that,  

---
stuck in a codependent emotionally  abusive downward spiral.

---

Abuse thrives in silence.

---

That was when suicide became my  Get Outta Jail Free Card.

---

At that time, every bad thing that had ever happened to me,  

---

I relived it! Every flaw I had, I saw it! 

---

Every mistake I ever made, I mourned it! I was a  passenger in my own body, 

---

crying in public, screaming barefoot in the street,   

---
financially and emotionally dependent, 

---

watching my sanity slip between my fingers like  grains of sand.

---

I was the little girl who was abused by a trusted loved one  

---
and was  made to feel responsible for the shame of it! 

---

I was the woman, like my mother, who  had forgiven a man for cheating  

---
just to have him turn around and do it again! 


---

I was checking myself into the psyche ward thinking I was the problem  

---
while he  was on the phone screaming into my ear 

---

that HE had been the one taking care of me,  not no doctors, 

---

refusing to say he loved me, and demanding that when I get outta the  psyche ward I show him my credit report.

---

I was the one who kept running back.

---

I was  the one Luci found unconscious after I hung myself, 

---

and a few days later he left me  home alone for 6 hours while he took another chick on a date.

---

I was the one who’s man  was taking half naked pictures of women IN MY CLOTHES, 


---

in our home, while my  mother was battling cancer.

---

I was the one who was unstable and fragile.

---

I yelled.

---

I  threw shit.

---

I begged him to stop hurting me instead of just leaving.

---

I was reliving my  mother’s relationship with my father! 
 

---
I was reliving my mother’s relationship with my father.

---

I was just like her.

---

Every mistake  she ever made with me was an effort to save me from THIS.

---

And now I couldn’t judge  her.

---

Because now I understood her.

---

I was her.

---

The difference is the man I loved only  had to beat my ass once to get me to leave

---

## NIKKI: 
The klonopin was for my anxiety.

---

The doxepin was for my back pain and to help me  sleep.

---

And the Paxil was for my depression.

---

The fact that I’d attempted suicide meant  they could keep me until they felt I was no longer a threat to myself.

---

And if you refuse  your meds, it takes longer to get out.

---

And trust me, once you were in,  

---

## ECHO 1 AND ECHO 2:
You WANTED to get out.

---

## NIKKI: 
I wasn’t making no money, I couldn’t afford a fancy ass mental health resort like the  facility 

---

my homey who works in finance went to when he needed treatment for  alcoholism.

---

Nah.

---

The state was paying for my broke ass to get help.

---

This hospital was  more like psychiatric jail… but with graham crackers.

---


They put me on meds the second day I was in there.

---

In fact, the only time I saw my  psychiatrist was when he was prescribing me meds.

---

There wasn’t no one-on-one  therapy sessions.

---

If we didn’t feel comfortable opening up in group therapy then we  wouldn’t get no help at all.

---

Except for meds.

---

EVERYBODY got meds.

---

## NIKKI AND ECHOES: 
“With a meds meds here and a meds meds there, here a med, there a meds,  everywhere a meds meds…” 

---

## NIKKI: 
And I didn’t wanna take them.

---

But I needed to get better so I could be there for my  momma.

---

So unlike the FIRST time I got hospitalized, this time I was willing to try  anything.

---

Now, I’ve never even smoked weed before so these psychiatric drugs put me  on my ass.

---

I didn’t even know how bad I was reacting to them until my girl Erica 

---

told  me I’d been sitting in group therapy moaning out loud, 

---

rocking back and forth with a  blanket over my head.

---

The doctors told me I needed a “meds adjustment.” And they gave me more days.

---

So  you mean to tell me I’ve been here a week trying to get better so I can take care of my  mom 

---

and y’all are giving me meds that are gonna keep me away from her longer?

---

## NIKKI AND ECHOES: 
Awww hell naw! 

---

## NIKKI: 
So the plan was simple.

---

Everyday after nasty ass lunch, we would be given our medication.

---

When I took mine I  would hide the pills via a process called “cheeking,”  

---
which involves depositing the  meds between your gums and your cheek.

---

I would convene with my friends Erica and Megan at the coloring book table after nasty ass lunch.

---

Megan would hand me the  napkin she smuggled upstairs from nasty ass lunch and I would deposit the pills into  the napkin.

---

Then pass the napkin under the coloring book table to Erica,  

---
who would  take the pills into her room, 

---

flush them down the toilet, and be back in time for group  therapy… 

---

And we did the same thing after nasty ass dinner.

---

After organizing all of my fellow psyche ward inmates to write a list of grievances  

---
and  formally submit them to the administrator 

---

who was the boss of our floor manager, I got  released the next day.

---


Now don’t get me wrong, I still wanted to die.

---

But my mom needed me.

---

So I decided I  would be there for my momma til she got better, 

---

and THEN I would finally be able to  use my Get Outta Jail Free card.

---


That way everybody wins! 
 

---
Y’all… My momma wasn’t doing too good.

---

I mean, of course I knew she was a fighter  so she was gonna beat cancer.

---

Of course.

---

But still… I was worried.

---

She’d lost a lot of  weight.

---

Chemo had taken her hair.

---

And she didn’t have the energy to dress up and be  stylish anymore.

---

She was in constant pain and the meds they had her on were so strong   

---
that sometimes they made her feel even worse than her cancer did.

---

My lil brother had  given up his apartment to move back home with her.

---

My big sister had given up her  job to help run my mom’s company.

---

The only one who hadn’t made a real difference  was me.

---

So as my mom started being hospitalized more and more, 

---
 I realized the one  thing I could do was make sure she was never alone.

---

I spent about 3 months living in  the hospital with my mom.

---


It’s funny… my mom wanted so badly to live.

---

And I wanted soooo badly to die.

---

Life is  cruel like that.

---

I found myself wishing I could trade places with her.

---

So she could make  the most out of the life I didn’t want.

## NIKKI: 
Living in the hospital with my mom wasn’t easy.

---

I was so broke that I was scraping  together coins to eat food from the cafeteria.

---

After my ex beat me up, not only was I  hiding my injuries from my family, but hell…  

---
when my dead baby’s father beat my ass, I  never went back for my stuff.

---

I couldn’t do it.

---

I left everything behind.

---

Including my  computer.

---

And I couldn’t earn money from a hospital room without it.

---

After my aunt  lied about buying me a new computer it was my best friend Keisha  

---
who stepped up  and got one for me.

---

And that was another thing… I hated having to spend so much  time around my family.

---

Now my siblings, my nephews, and half of my hundreds of my  cousins, they’re cool as hell, I love them.

---

But like… my mom is the oldest of 13 kids  and about a half dozen of them fucking suuuck.

---

## NIKKI AND ECHOES: 
They didn’t give a fuck-- 

---

## NIKKI: 
That I was depressed and suicidal.

---

Instead of being there for my siblings and me,  

---
my  aunts and uncles were spreading rumors that I changed my mom’s will 

---

and that’s how I  ended up being power of attorney.

---

They tried to turn my big sister against me saying I coerced my mom 

---

even though she’d had her will notarized 2 years before she even got  sick.

---

They even said I forged documents and hid the real will all 

---

because they thought I  was trying to keep them from getting my mom’s fur coats.

---

Yeah.

---

Fur coats.

---

Did I  mention I’ve been vegan for 20 years?

---

Ain’t no vegans wearing fur, bruh.

---

## NIKKI: 
Despite the stressful ass drama going on, my mom actually made the hospital stay fun  at times.

---

She asked to hear every song I ever made and watched every video I  recorded, telling the nurses  

---

## P1: 
“This is MY baby’s music!” 

---

## NIKKI: 
Had me feeling myself so much that I sent like 15 songs to Spike Lee  

---
just in case he  wanted to make me famous.

---

And my mom would watch CSI for hours.

---

At first, I hated  it.

---

Within a week it became my favorite show on television.

---

And my momma would love  telling the same jokes over and over, not to be funny but specifically to embarrass me.

---

You shoulda heard her lil ass in the hospital talking to my friends Jahmilah and Chris: 

---

## ECHO 2:
“Honeyyy, I knew Nikki was gon be an entertainer.

---

I knew it since she was potty  training.

---

When she was a toddler, whenever we had company she would come into the  living room with her potty,  

---
and she would use the pot in front of everybody and she  would stay on that little potty until we clapped.

---

Yesss lawd, I knew my baby was an  entertainer.

---

Nothing she does surprises me.” 

---

## NIKKI: 
But my mom’s favorite thing to bring up in the hospital  

---
was this one time when I was a  teenager and we got into an argument,  

---
the one time I actually had the balls to talk  back.

---

My mom would look  across the room at me, smile sweetly, and say  

---

## ECHO 1:
"Remember when u were a teenager and u said u didn't wanna be anything like me?

---

How’s that working out for ya?” 

---

## NIKKI: 
It’s crazy that it took me living with my mom in a hospital for me to realize how much  we have in common.

---

I found out we’d both attempted suicide after losing a baby.

---

Hers  happened before I was born.

## NIKKI AND ECHOES: 
How come we’d never talked about it?

---

## NIKKI: 
We’d both forgiven a man for cheating only for them to turn around and do it  again.

---

My grandma had done it too.

---

## NIKKI AND ECHOES: 
How come we’d never talked about it?

---

## NIKKI: 
We’d both been molested by a family member as kids.

---

When she spoke up nobody  believed her either, and that’s why she absolutely believed me.

---

## NIKKI AND ECHOES: 
How come we’d never talked about it?

---

## NIKKI: 
When I wear high heels I carry my body weight just like my mom.

---

## NIKKI: 
When I laugh, I throw my head back just like my mom.

---

And in spite of how rocky my childhood had been,  

---
she had successfully managed to  instill in me the best parts of herself,  

---
the parts that helped me survive the same  hardships she’d endured.

---

And what’s crazy is even in that moment, in constant pain,   

---
fighting for her life she was giving her suicidal daughter a reason to live.

---

She wanted to  live.

---

So I needed to live.

---

Because she needed me to live.

---

So I was gonna live so I could  help her live… and then one day my mom decided she no longer wanted to live.

---

That morning the doctors came in early.

---

Hospice.

---

That’s what they call it when you’re  waiting to die.

---

They said it was time.

---

My mom asked if there was anything  more they could do.

---

They said no.

---

I argued with them.

---

She told me to stop.

---

She said  she wanted to die.

---

I told her no.

---

It’s not fair.

---

How come she could just decide to die?

---

She said no.

---

She was in too much pain.

---

It was time.

---

She asked me to play her favorite  song, this gospel tune called “The Storm is Over.”

---

She said she wanted to hug all her loved ones one last time.

---

She said she just  wanted to go home and be with the lord.

---


She said she wanted to go home and be with the lord.

---

She said she wanted to go  home and be with the lord.

---

For my last talk with my momma, I hit record.

## NIKKI: 
I had no parents.

---

I had no baby.

---

I had no boyfriend.

---

I had no family.

---

I had no money.

---

All I had was a world full of no.

---

But I was calm.

---

Because this was it.

---

I just had to make it  til the funeral.

---

After that….

---


I locked myself in my apartment and didn’t eat or drink.

---

I typed the passwords for all of  my accounts in an email  

---
and saved it to my drafts to send to my best friend Keisha  when it was time.

---

Keisha had been my rock, a constant source of unconditional love   

---
through the past several years of hell I’d been through.

---

I was glad I would no longer be  her burden.

---

I just laid in bed, counting down the days until my mom’s funeral.

---


Day 1 passed.

---

Day 2 passed.

---

Day 3 passed.

---

Day 4 passed.

---

## NIKKI AND ECHOES: 
On the morning of day 5, my phone rang 

---

## NIKKI: 
“Hello.

---

Can I speak to Nikki Lynette?” 

---

This is me.

---


“Hello Nikki.

---

This is Spike Lee.”

---

what?

---


“This is Spike Lee.” Are you serious?

---


He laughed.

---

He was serious.

---

He was calling because he’d listened to the songs I’d sent  that day 

---

when I was in the hospital with my mom and he liked one of them so much  

---

that he wanted to put it in his Netflix show.

---

I wanted to be excited.

---

I wanted to speak  myself up and mention that I can act and sell myself...

---


But I couldn’t.

---

Instead, I talked to Spike about losing my mom,  

---
and how mean my  family had been, and how bad I was feeling.

---

And he listened, and asked questions.

---

And had compassion.

---

And he told me the same thing my mom told me, that I needed  to get back to my music.

---

I had a song that was gonna be featured in his show  

---
and he  wanted me to know he thought the song was awesome.

---

After that phone call, well…I decided to rethink this whole suicide thing.

---

I mean, why  not just live long enough to see my song on a Spike Lee joint and then go out with a  bang?

---
And in the meantime, maybe I could just make some crazy ass music, have some  unprotected sex,

---

just really live it the fuck up and then go out in a blaze of glory!  

---
This  was gonna be the most rational and well thought out suicide ever.

---

## ECHOES: 
Totally.

---

So rational.

---

So well thought out.

---

## NIKKI: 
My mom’s funeral was a couple days after that talk with Spike Lee.

---

But the phone call  that actually saved my life came a couple months later  

---
when Spike just happened to  call to update me about the song right in the midst of me having a depressive episode.

---

When he heard the state I was in, he said 

---

## NIKKI: 
“Nikki.

---

The storm is over.

---

Your mom’s not in pain anymore.

---

The storm is over now.

---

You  gotta get back to your music.

---

You have to stop grieving.

---

It’s time for you to put it in  your art.” 

---

## NIKKI AND ECHOES: 
Get back to your music.

---

Put it in your art.

---

## NIKKI: 
That’s what my mom had said.

---

She played that song called “The Storm is Over.” 

---

## ECHOES: 
The Storm is Over.

---

## NIKKI: 
--and she told me to get back to my art.

---

And in that moment I felt like my mom was  trying to speak to me through folks in my life.

---

And I realized I couldn’t go on living as two  people, 

---

one who was fighting to live in anticipation of good things in the future, 

---

and  one who wanted to die because of all I’d lost in the past.

---

I couldn’t be both people  anymore.

---

It was time to use my Get Outta Jail free card.

---

That day I made a decision to  kill the part of myself that was stuck in the past  

---
so that the rest of me could live.

---

## NIKKI ON VIDEO: 
You can’t kill me.

---

You need me.

---

You have no identity outside of being sad and  depressed.

---

What, you just gon start acting happy now?

---

## NIKKI: 
I gotta stop mourning my parents, my baby, my cats, my lost relationship, my lost time.

---

You won’t let me live so you gotta go.

---

## NIKKI ON VIDEO: 
You blaming me?

---

You were the one dumb enough to get pregnant and trade your  career in for a nigga who abused you.

---

If you woulda been making money you could  have afforded better care  

---
that could have saved your mom’s life.

---

YOU gotta go.

---

## NIKKI: 
I can’t get that time back but I can make a life worth living and I can’t take you with me.

---

You gotta go.

---

## NIKKI ON VIDEO: 
The old you made a life worth living and how did that work out?

---

Be realistic, YOU gotta  go.

---

## NIKKI: 
That’s what you do.

---

You constantly make me compare myself to how I used to be.

---

No I  can’t get my momma back.

---

I can’t get my child back, I can’t get my time back  

---
but I’m  done being stuck in the past.

---

You make me hate myself.

---

You make me feel like I’m not  good enough.

---

You gotta go.

---

I been this way for too long, I can’t go on like this and u  can fight me if u want  

---
but you better bring it the fuck on cuz only one of us is gonna  make it out alive!

## NIKKI: 
I have a black cat named Sable now.

---

I got her when she was a kitten.

---

She was the daughter I always wanted  

---
until I came home one day and she had balls and I realized  she was a boy.

---

My romantic life is pretty good, too.

---

I’m getting food, sex, and money  pretty consistently so… you know.

---

I'm living the dream.

---

And I’m looking pretty good  these days, because I follow my mom’s 3 most important beauty tips:

---

## NIKKI AND ECHOES: 
“Drink lots of water, moisturize twice a day, and don’t let no nigga dog you out.” 

---

## NIKKI: 
I’ll never be a role model, u know?

---

I’m a suicide survivor, an abuse survivor, I don’t  wear underwear,  

---
I speak openly about sex which women ain’t supposed to do despite  the fact that that’s dumb as hell  

---
cuz if women didn’t like sex wouldn’t none of y’all be  here… I’m not a role model.

---

But what I am is a damned good possibility model.

---

I’m  standing here right now because I’m living proof that it’s possible for you or you or you  or YOU  

---
to go to the deepest darkest lowest pits of despair and pain and loss and  hopelessness  

---
and still get out alive.
