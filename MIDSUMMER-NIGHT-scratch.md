[mass battle sounds]

---

## THESEUS:
Now fair Hippolita, our nuptial hour
Draws on apace: four happy days bring in

---


Another Moon: but oh, me thinks, how slow
This old Moon wanes; She lingers my desires

---


Like to a Step-dame, or a Dowager,
Long withering out a young man's revenue.

---

## HIPPOLYTA:
Four days will quickly steep themselves in nights
Four nights will quickly dream away the time:

---


And then the Moon, like to a silver bow,
Now bent in heaven, shall behold the night
Of our solemnities.

---

## THESEUS:
Hippolita, I woo'd thee with my sword,
And won thy love, doing thee injuries:

---


But I will wed thee in another key,
With pomp, with triumph, and with reveling.

---

## EGEUS:
Happy be Theseus, our renowned Duke.

---

## THESEUS:
Thanks good Egeus: what's the news with thee?

---

## EGEUS:
 Full of vexation, come I, with complaint
Against my child, my daughter Hermia.

---


My Noble Lord,
This man hath my consent to marry her.

---


And my gracious Duke,
This man hath bewitch'd the bosom of my child:

---


Thou, thou Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes,
And interchanged love-tokens with my child:

---


Thou hast by Moon-light at her window sung,
With feigning voice, verses of feigning love,

---


And stolen the impression of her fantasies,
With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gauds, conceits,

---


Knacks, trifles, Nose-gays, sweet meats (messengers
Of strong prevailment in unhardened youth)

---


With cunning hast thou filched my daughter's heart,
Turn'd her obedience (which is due to me)

---


To stubborn harshness. And my gracious Duke,
Be it so she will not here before your Grace,

---


Consent to marry with Demetrius,
I beg the ancient privilege of Athens;

---


As she is mine, I may dispose of her;
Which shall be either to this Gentleman,

---


Or to her death, according to our Law,
Immediately provided in that case.

---

## THESEUS:
What say you Hermia? Be advised fair Maid,
To you your Father should be as a God;

---


One that composed your beauties; yea and one
To whom you are but as a form in wax

---


By him imprinted: and within his power,
To leave the figure, or disfigure it:
Demetrius is a worthy Gentleman.

---

## HERMIA:
So is Lysander.

---

## THESEUS:
In himself he is.
But in this kind, wanting your fathers voice.
The other must be held the worthier.

---

## HERMIA:
I would my father looked but with my eyes.

---

## THESEUS:
Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.

---

## HERMIA:
I do entreat your Grace to pardon me.
I know not by what power I am made bold,

---


Nor how it may concern my modesty
In such a presence here to plead my thoughts:

---


But I beseech your Grace, that I may know
The worst that may befall me in this case,
If I refuse to wed Demetrius.

---

## THESEUS:
Either to dye the death, or to abjure
Forever the society of men.

---


Therefore faire Hermia question your desires,
Know of your youth, examine well your blood,

---


Whether (if you yield not to your fathers choice)
You can endure the livery of a Nun,

---


For aye to be in shady Cloister mew'd,
To live a barren sister all your life,

---


Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless Moon,
Thrice blessed they that master so their blood,

---


To undergo such maiden pilgrimage,
But earthlier happy is the Rose distill'd,

---


Then that which withering on the virgin thorn,
Grows, lives, and dies, in single blessedness.

---

## HERMIA:
So will I grow, so live, so die my Lord,
Ere I will yield my virgin Patent up

---


Unto his Lordship, whose unwished yoke,
My soul consents not to give sovereignty.

---

## THESEUS:
Take time to pause, and by the next new Moon
The sealing day betwixt my love and me,

---


For everlasting bond of fellowship:
Upon that day either prepare to die,

---


For disobedience to your fathers will,
Or else to wed Demetrius as he would,

---


Or on Diana’s Altar to protest
For aye, austerity, and single life.

---

## DEMETRIUS:
Relent sweet Hermia, and Lysander, yield
Thy crazed title to my certain right.

---

## LYSANDER:
You have her fathers love, Demetrius:
Let me have Hermia’s: do you marry him.

---

## EGEUS:
Scornful Lysander, true, he hath my Love;
And what is mine, my love shall render him.

---


And she is mine, and all my right of her,
I do estate unto Demetrius.

---

## LYSANDER:
I am my Lord, as well derived as he,
As well possessed: my love is more than his:

---


My fortunes every way as fairly ranked
(If not with vantage) as Demetrius:

---


And (which is more then all these boasts can be)
I am beloved of beauteous Hermia.

---


Why should not I then prosecute my right?
Demetrius, I’ll avouch it to his head,

---


Made love to Nedar’s daughter, Helena,
And won her soul: and she (sweet Lady) dotes,

---


Devoutly dotes, dotes in Idolatry,
Upon this spotted and inconstant man.

---

## THESEUS:
I must confess, that I have heard so much,
And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof:

---


But being Over-full of self-affaires,
My mind did lose it. But Demetrius come,

---


And come Egeus, you shall go with me,
I have some private schooling for you both.

---


For you fair Hermia, look you arm yourself,
To fit your fancies to your Fathers will;

---


Or else the Law of Athens yields you up
(Which by no means we may extenuate)

---


To death, or to a vow of single life.
Come my Hippolita, what cheer my love?

---


Demetrius and Egeus go along:
I must employ you in some business

---


Against our nuptial, and confer with you
Of something, nearly that concerns yourselves.

---

## EGEUS:
With duty and desire we follow you.

---

## LYSANDER:
How now my love? Why is your cheek so pale?
How chance the Roses there do fade so fast?

---

## HERMIA:
Belike for want of rain, which I could well
Beteem them, from the tempest of mine eyes.

---

## LYSANDER:
For ought that ever I could read,
Could ever hear by tale or history,
The course of true love never did run smooth,

---

## HERMIA:
If then true Lovers have been ever crossed
It stands as an edict in destiny:

---


Then let us teach our trial patience,
Because it is a customary crosse,

---


As due to love, as thoughts, and dreams, and sighs,
Wishes and tears; poor Fancie’s followers.

---

## LYSANDER:
A good persuasion; therefore hear me Hermia,
I have a Widow Aunt, a dowager,

---


Of great revenue, and she hath no child,
From Athens is her house removed seven leagues,

---


And she respects me, as her only son:
There gentle Hermia, may I marry thee,

---


And to that place, the sharp Athenian Law
Cannot pursue us. If thou lov’st me, then
Steal forth thy fathers house tomorrow night:

---


And in the wood, a league without the town,
(Where I did meet thee once with Helena,

---


To do observance for a morn of May)
There will I stay for thee.

---

## HERMIA:
My good Lysander,
I swear to thee, by Cupid's strongest bow,

---


By his best arrow with the golden head,
By the simplicity of Venus Doves,

---


By that which knitted souls, and prospers love,
And by that fire which burned the Carthage Queen,

---


When the false Troyan under sail was seen,
By all the vows that ever men have broke,

---


(In number more than ever women spoke)
In that same place thou hast appointed me,
Tomorrow truly will I meet with thee.

---

## LYSANDER:
Keep promise love: look here comes Helena.

---

## HERMIA:
God speed fair Helena, whither away?

---

## HELENA:
Call you me fair? That fair again unsay,
Demetrius loves you fair: O happy fair!

---


Your eyes are lodestars, and your tongue's sweet air
More tunable then Lark to shepherd’s ear,

---


Your words I catch, fair Hermia ere I go,
My ear should catch your voice, my eye, your eye,

---


My tongue should catch your tongue’s sweet melody,
Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated,
The rest I’ll give to be to you translated.

---


O teach me how you look, and with what art
you sway the motion of Demetrius heart.

---

## HERMIA:
I frown upon him, yet he loves me still.

---

## HELENA:
O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill.

---

## HERMIA:
I give him curses, yet he gives me love.

---

## HELENA:
O that my prayers could such affection move.

---

## HERMIA:
The more I hate, the more he follows me.

---

## HELENA:
The more I love, the more he hateth me.

---

## HERMIA:
His folly Helena is none of mine.

---

## HELENA:
None but your beauty, would that fault were mine

---

## HERMIA:
Take comfort: he no more shall see my face,
Lysander and myself will fly this place.

---

## LYSANDER:
Helen, to you our minds we will unfold,
Tomorrow night, when Phoebe doth behold
Her silver visage, in the watery glass,

---


Decking with liquid pearl, the bladed grass
(A time that Lovers flights doth still conceal)
Through Athens gates, have we devised to steal.

---

## HERMIA:
And in the wood, where often you and I,
Upon faint Primrose beds, were wont to lie,
Emptying our bosoms, of their counsel swelled:

---


There my Lysander, and my self shall meet,
And thence from Athens turn away our eyes
To seek new friends and strange companions,

---


Farwell sweet play-fellow, pray thou for us,
And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius.

---


Keep word Lysander we must starve our sight,
From lovers food, till morrow deep midnight.

---

## LYSANDER:
I will my Hermia. Helena adieu,
As you on him, Demetrius dotes on you.

---

## HELENA:
How happy some, or othersome can be?
Through Athens I am thought as fair as she.

---


But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so:
He will not know, what all, but he doth know,

---


And as he errs, doting on Hermia’s eyes;
So I, admiring of his qualities:

---


Things base and vile, holding no quantity,
Love can transpose to form and dignity,

---


Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind,
And therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blind.

---


Nor hath love's mind of any judgment taste:
Wings and no eyes, figure, unheedy haste.

---


And therefore is Love said to be a child,
Because in choice he is often beguil'd,

---


As waggish boys in game themselves forswear;
So the boy Love is perjur’d everywhere.

---


For ere Demetrius looked on Hermia’s eyne,
He hailed down oaths that he was only mine.

---


And when this Hail some heat from Hermia felt,
So he dissolved, and showers of oaths did melt,
I will go tell him of fair Hermia’s flight:

---


Then to the wood will he, tomorrow night
Pursue her; and for his intelligence,
If I have thanks, it is a dear expense:

---


But herein mean I to enrich my pain,
To have his sight thither, and back again.


---


[MUSIC]

---

## QUINCE:
Is all our company here?

---

## BOTTOM:
You were best to call them generally, man by man according to the script.

---

## QUINCE:
Here is the scroll of every man's name, which is thought fit through all Athens, to play in our Enterlude before the Duke and the Dutchess, on his wedding day at night.

---

## BOTTOM:
First, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats on: then read the names of the Actors: and so grow on to a point.

---

## QUINCE:
Marry our play is the most lamentable Comedy and most cruel death of Pyramus and Thisby.

---

## BOTTOM:
A very good piece of work I assure you, and a merry. Now good Peter Quince, call forth your Actors by the scroll. Masters spread yourselves.

---

## QUINCE:
Answer as I call you. Nick Bottom the Weaver.

---

## BOTTOM:
Ready; name what part I am for, and proceed.

---

## QUINCE:
You Nick Bottom are set down for Pyramus.

---

## BOTTOM:
What is Pyramus, a lover, or a tyrant?

---

## QUINCE:
A Lover that kills himself most gallantly for love.

---

## BOTTOM:
That will ask some tears in the true performing of it: if I do it, let the audience look to their eyes: I will move storms; I will condole in some measure. To the rest yet, my chief humor is for a tyrant. I could play Ercles rarely, or a part to tear a Cat in, to make all split the raging Rocks; and shivering shocks shall break the locks of prison gates, and Phibbus car shall shine from far, and make and mar the foolish Fates. This was lofty. Now name the rest of the Players. This is Ercles vain, a tyrant's vain: a lover is more condoling.

---

## QUINCE:
Francis Flute the Bellows-mender.

---

## FLUTE:
Here Peter Quince.

---

## QUINCE:
You must take Thisby on you.

---

## FLUTE:
What is Thisby, a wandering Knight?

---

## QUINCE:
It is the Lady that Pyramus must love.

---

## FLUTE:
Nay faith, let not me play a woman, I have a
beard coming.

---

## QUINCE:
That's all one, you shall play it in a Maske, and you may speak as small as you will.

---

## BOTTOM:
And I may hide my face, let me play Thisby too: I’ll speak in a monstrous little voice; Thisne, Thisne, ah Pyramus my lover dear, thy Thisby dear, and Lady dear.

---

## QUINCE:
No no, you must play Pyramus, and Flute, you Thisby.

---

## BOTTOM:
Well, proceed.

---

## QUINCE:
Robin Starveling the Taylor.

---

## STARVELING:
Here Peter Quince.

---

## QUINCE:
Robin Starveling, you must play Thisby’s mother? Tom Snout, the Tinker.

---

## SNOUT:
Here Peter Quince.

---

## QUINCE:
You, Pyramus father; my self, Thisby’s father;
Snug the Joiner, you the Lions part: and I hope there is a play fitted.

---

## SNUG:
Have you the Lions part written? pray you if be, give it me, for I am slow of study.

---

## QUINCE:
You may do it extempore, for it is nothing but roaring.

---

## BOTTOM:
Let me play the Lion too, I will roar that I will do any man’s heart good to hear me. I will roar, that I will make the Duke say, Let him roar again, let him roar again.

---

## QUINCE:
If you should do it too terribly, you would fright the Duchess and the Ladies, that they would shrike, and that were enough to hang us all.

---

## ALL:
That would hang us every mothers son.

---

## BOTTOM:
I grant you friends, if that you should
fright the Ladies out of their Wits, they would
have no more discretion but to hang us: but I will aggravate

---


my voice so, that I will roar you as gently as
any sucking Dove; I will roar and 'twere any Nightingale.

---

## QUINCE:
You can play no part but Piramus, for Piramus is a sweet-faced man, a proper man as one shall see in a summer's day; a most lovely Gentleman-like man, therfore you must needs play Piramus.

---

## BOTTOM:
Well, I will undertake it. What beard were I best to play it in?

---

## QUINCE:
Why, what you will.

---

## BOTTOM:
I will discharge it, in either your straw-color beard, your orange tawny beard, your purple in grain beard, or your French-crown color'd beard, your perfect yellow.

---

## QUINCE:
Some of your French Crowns have no hair at all, and then you will play bare-faced. But masters here are your parts, and I am to intreat you, request you, and desire you, to con them by tomorrow night: and meet me in the palace wood, a mile without the Towne, by Moonlight, there we will rehearse: for if we meet in the City, we shall be dog'd with company, and our devises known. In the meantime, I will draw a bill of properties, such as our play wants. I pray you fail me not.

---

## BOTTOM:
We will meet, and there we may rehearse more obscenely and courageously. Take pains, be perfect, adieu.

---

## QUINCE:
At the Duke's oak we meet.

---

## BOTTOM:
Enough, hold or cut bow-strings.

[MUSIC]

[GRUNTS AND CHEERS]

---

## OBERON:
Ill met by Moonlight.
Proud Titania.

---

## TITANIA:
What, jealous Oberon? Fairy skip hence.
I have forsworn his bed and company.

---

## OBERON:
Tarry rash Wanton; am not I thy Lord?

---

## TITANIA:
Then I must be thy Lady: but I know
When thou wast stolen away from Fairy Land,

---


And in the shape of Corin, sat all day,
Playing on pipes of Corn, and versing love

---


To amorous Phillida. Why art thou here
Come from the farthest steep of India?

---


But that forsooth the bouncing Amazon
Your buskined Mistress, and your Warrior love,

---


To Theseus must be Wedded; and you come,
To give their bed joy and prosperity.

---

## OBERON:
How canst thou thus for shame Titania,
Glance at my credit, with Hippolita?

---


Knowing I know thy love to Theseus?
Didst thou not lead him through the glimmering night
From Peregenia, whom he ravished?

---


And make him with faire Eagles break his faith
With Ariadne, and Atiopa?

---

## TITANIA:
These are the forgeries of jealousy,
And never since the middle Summers spring
Met we on hill, in dale, forest, or mead,

---


By paved fountain, or by rushy brooke,
Or in the beached margent of the sea,

---


To dance our ringlets to the whistling Winde,
But with thy brawls thou hast disturb'd our sport.

---


Therefore the Windes, piping to us in vain,
As in revenge, have suck'd up from the sea
Contagious fogs: Which falling in the Land,

---


Hath every petty River made so proud,
That they have Over -borne their Continents.

---


The humane mortals want their winter here,
No night is now with hymn or carol blest;

---


Therefore the Moon (the governess of floods)
Pale in her anger, washes all the air;
That Rheumatic diseases do abound.

---


And through this distemperature, we see
The seasons alter; hoared headed frosts
Fall in the fresh lap of the crimson Rose,

---


And on old Hyems' chin and Icy crown,
An odorous Chaplet of sweet Summer buds
Is as in mockery set. The Spring, the Summer,

---


The childing Autumn, angry Winter change
Their wonted Liveries, and the mazed world,
By their increase, now knows not which is which;

---


And this same progeny of evils,
Comes from our debate, from our dissention,

---


We are their parents and original.

---

## OBERON:
Do you amend it then, it lies in you,
Why should Titania crosse her Oberon?

---


I do but beg a little changeling boy,
To be my Henchman.

---

## TITANIA:
Set your heart at rest,
The Fairy land buys not the child of me,

---


His mother was a Votress of my Order,
And in the spiced Indian air, by night
Full often hath she gossiped by my side,

---


And sat with me on Neptune's yellow sands,
Marking th'embarked traders on the flood,

---


When we have laughed to see the sails conceive,
And grow big bellied with the wanton wind:

---


Which she with pretty and with swimming gate,
Following (her womb then rich with my young squire)
Would imitate, and sail Upon the Land,

---


To fetch me trifles, and return again,
As from a voyage, rich with merchandise.

---


But she being mortal, of that boy did die,
And for her sake I do rear up her boy,
And for her sake I will not part with him.

---

## OBERON:
How long within this wood intend you stay?

---

## TITANIA:
Perchance till after Theseus wedding day.
If you will patiently dance in our Round,

---


And see our Moonlight revels, go with us;
If not, shun me and I will spare your haunts.

---

## OBERON:
Give me that boy, and I will go with thee.

---

## TITANIA:
Not for thy Fairy Kingdom. Fairies away:
We shall chide downright, if I longer stay.

---

## OBERON:
Well, go thy way: thou shalt not from this grove,
Till I torment thee for this injury.

---


My gentle Puck come hither; thou remembrest
Since once I sat Upon a promontory,

---


And heard a Mermaid on a Dolphin's back,
Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath,

---


That the rude sea grew civil at her song,
And certain stars shot madly from their Spheres,
To hear the Sea-maids music.

---

## PUCK:
I remember.

---

## OBERON:
That very time I saw (but thou couldst not)
Flying between the cold Moon and the earth,

---


Cupid all armed; a certain aim he took
At a fair Vestal, throned by the West,

---


And loos'd his love-shaft smartly from his bow,
As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts,

---


But I might see young Cupid’s fiery shaft
Quencht in the chaste beams of the watery Moon;
And the imperial Votress passed on,

---


In maiden meditation, fancy free.
Yet marked I where the bolt of Cupid fell.

---


It fell upon a little western flower;
Before, milk-white; now purple with love's wound,
And maidens call it, Love in idleness.

---


Fetch me that flower; the herb I showed thee once,
The juice of it, on sleeping eye-lids laid,

---


Will make or man or woman madly dote
Upon the next live creature that it sees.

---


Fetch me this herb, and be thou here again,
Ere the Leviathan can swim a league.

---

## PUCK:
I’ll put a girdle about the earth, in forty minutes.

---

## OBERON:
Having once this juice,
I’ll watch Titania, when she is asleep,
And drop the liquor of it in her eyes:

---


The next thing when she waking looks upon,
(Be it on Lion, Bear, or Wolf, or Bull,

---


On meddling Monkey, or on busy Ape)
She shall pursue it, with the soul of love.

---


And ere I take this charm off from her sight,
(As I can take it with another herb)
I’ll make her render up her Page to me.

---

## DEMETRIUS:
I love thee not, therefore pursue me not

---

## OBERON:
But who comes here? I am invisible,
And I will Over -hear their conference.

---

## DEMETRIUS:
Where is Lysander, and fair Hermia?
The one I’ll stay, the other stayeth me.

---


Thou toldst me they were stolen into this wood;
And here am I, and wood within this wood,

---


Because I cannot meet my Hermia.
Hence, get thee gone, and follow me no more.

---

## HELENA:
You draw me, you hard-hearted Adamant,
But yet you draw not Iron, for my heart

---


Is true as steel. Leave you your power to draw,
And I shall have no power to follow you.

---

## DEMETRIUS:
Do I entice you? do I speak you fair?
Or rather do I not in plainest truth,
Tell you I do not, nor I cannot love you?

---

## HELENA:
And even for that do I love thee the more;
I am your spaniel, and Demetrius,

---


The more you beat me, I will fawn on you.
Use me but as your spaniel; spurn me, strike me,

---


Neglect me, lose me; only give me leave
(Unworthy as I am) to follow you.

---

## DEMETRIUS:
Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit,
For I am sick when I do look on thee.

---

## HELENA:
And I am sick when I look not on you.
---

## DEMETRIUS:
You do impeach your modesty too much,
To leave the City, and commit yourself
Into the hands of one that loves you not,

---


To trust the opportunity of night,
And the ill counsel of a desert place,
With the rich worth of your virginity.

---

## HELENA:
Your virtue is my privilege: for that
It is not night when I do see your face.
Therefore I think I am not in the night,

---


Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company,
For you in my respect are all the world.

---


Then how can it be said I am alone,
When all the world is here to look on me?

---

## DEMETRIUS:
I’ll run from thee, and hide me in the brakes,
And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts.

---

## HELENA:
The wildest hath not such a heart as you;
Run when you will, the story shall be changed:
Apollo flies and Daphne holds the chase;

---


The Dove pursues the Griffin, the mild Hind
Makes speed to catch the Tiger. Bootless speed,
When cowardice pursues, and valor flies.

---

## DEMETRIUS:
I will not stay thy questions, let me go;
Or if thou follow me, do not believe,
But I shall do thee mischief in the wood.

---

## HELENA:
I, in the Temple, in the Towne, and Field
You do me mischief. Fie Demetrius,
Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex:

---


We cannot fight for love, as men may do;
We should be woo'd, and were not made to woo.
I follow thee, and make a heaven of hell,

---


To die upon the hand I love so well.

---

## OBERON:
Fare thee well Nymph, ere he do leave this grove,
Thou shalt fly him, and he shall seek thy love.
Hast thou the flower there? Welcome wanderer.

---

## PUCK:
Aye, there it is.

---

## OBERON:
I pray thee give it me.
I know a bank where the wild time blows,
Where Oxslips and the nodding Violet grows,

---


Quite Over-canopied with luscious woodbine,
With sweet musk roses, and with Eglantine;

---


There sleeps Titania, sometime of the night,
Lulled in these flowers, with dances and delight:

---


And with the juice of this I’ll streak her eyes,
And make her full of hateful fantasies.

---


Take thou some of it, and seek through this grove;
A sweet Athenian Lady is in love
With a disdainful youth: anoint his eyes,

---


But do it when the next thing he espies,
May be the Lady. Thou shalt know the man,

---


By the Athenian garments he hath on.
Effect it with some care, that he may prove

---


More fond on her, then she upon her love;
And look thou meet me ere the first Cock crow.

---

## PUCK:
Fear not my Lord, your servant shall do so.

---

[MUSIC]

---

## TITANIA:
Come, now a Roundell, and a Fairy song;
Sing me now asleep,
Then to your offices, and let me rest.

---

## FAIRY 2:
Hence away, now all is well;
One aloof, stand Sentinel.

---

## OBERON:
Go

---

## OBERON:
What thou seest when thou dost wake,
Doe it for thy true Love take:

---


Love and languish for his sake.
Be it Ounce, or Cat, or Bear,

---


Pard, or Boar with bristled hair,
In thy eye that shall appear,

---


When thou wak'st, it is thy dear,
Wake when some vile thing is near.

---

## LYSANDER:
Fair love, you faint with wandering in the woods,
And to speak troth I have forgot our way:

---


We'll rest us Hermia, if you think it good,
And tarry for the comfort of the day.

---

## HERMIA:
Be it so Lysander; find you out a bed,
For I upon this bank will rest my head.

---

## LYSANDER:
One turf shall serve as pillow for us both,
One heart, one bed, two bosoms, and one troth.

---

## HERMIA:
Nay good Lysander, for my sake my dear
Lie further off yet, do not lie so near.

---

## LYSANDER:
O take the sense sweet, of my innocence,
Love takes the meaning, in loves conference,

---


I mean that my heart unto yours is knit,
So that but one heart can you make of it.

---


Two bosoms interchanged with an oath,
So then two bosoms, and a single troth.

---


Then by your side, no bedroom me deny,
For lying so, Hermia, I do not lie.

---

## HERMIA:
Lysander riddles very prettily;
Now much beshrew my manners and my pride,
If Hermia meant to say, Lysander lied.

---


But gentle friend, for love and courtesy
Lie further off, in humane modesty,
Such separation, as may well be said,

---


Becomes a virtuous bachelor, and a maid,
So far be distant, and good night sweet friend;
Thy love nere alter, till thy sweet life end.

---

## LYSANDER:
Amen, amen, to that fair prayer, say I,
And then end life, when I end loyalty:
Here is my bed, sleep give thee all his rest.

---

## HERMIA:
With half that wish, the wisher's eyes be pressed.

---

## PUCK:
Through the Forest have I gone,
But Athenian find I none,

---


One whose eyes I might approve
This flowers force in stirring love.

---


Night and silence: who is here?
Weeds of Athens he doth wear:

---


This is he (my master said)
Despised the Athenian maid:

---


And here the maiden sleeping sound,
On the dank and dirty ground.

---


Pretty soul, she durst not lye
Near this lack-love, this kill-courtesy.

---


Churl, upon thy eyes I throw
All the power this charm doth owe:

---


When thou wak'st, let love forbid
Sleep his seat on thy eye-lid.

---


So awake when I am gone:
For I must now to Oberon.

---

## HELENA:
Stay, though thou kill me, sweet Demetrius.

---

## DEMETRIUS:
I charge thee hence, and do not haunt me thus.

---

## HELENA:
O wilt thou darkling leave me? do not so.

---

## DEMETRIUS:
Stay on thy peril, I alone will go.

---

## HELENA:
O I am out of breath, in this fond chase,
The more my prayer, the lesser is my grace,
Happy is Hermia, where so ere she lies;

---


For she hath blessed and attractive eyes.
How came her eyes so bright? Not with salt tears.

---


If so, my eyes are oftner washed then hers.
No, no, I am as ugly as a Bear;
For beasts that meet me, run away for fear.

---


But who is here? Lysander on the ground;
Dead or asleep? I see no blood, no wound,
Lysander, if you live, good sir awake.

---

## LYSANDER:
And run through fire I will for thy sweet sake.
Transparent Helen, nature shows her art,
That through thy bosom makes me see thy heart.

---


Where is Demetrius? Oh how fit a word
Is that vile name, to perish on my sword!

---

## HELENA:
Do not say so Lysander, say not so:
What though he love your Hermia? Lord, what though?
Yet Hermia still loves you; then be content.

---

## LYSANDER:
Content with Hermia? No, I do repent
The tedious minutes I with her have spent.

---


Not Hermia, but Helena now I love;
Who will not change a Sparrow for a Dove?

---


The will of man is by his reason sway'd:
And reason says you are the worthier Maid.

---


Things growing are not ripe until their season;
So I being young, till now ripe not to reason,

---


And touching now the point of humane skill,
Reason becomes the Marshall to my will,

---


And leads me to your eyes, where I orelook
Love’s stories, written in Love’s richest book.

---

## HELENA:
Wherefore was I to this keen mockry born?
When at your hands did I deserve this scorn?

---


Ist not enough, ist not enough, young man,
That I did never, no nor never can,

---


Deserve a sweet look from Demetrius eye,
But you must flout my insufficiency?

---


Good troth you do me wrong (good-sooth you do)
In such disdainful manner, me to woo.

---


But fare you well; perforce I must confess,
I thought you Lord of more true gentleness.

---


Oh, that a Lady of one man refused,
Should of another therefore be abused.


---

## LYSANDER:
She sees not Hermia: Hermia sleep thou there,
And never mayest thou come Lysander near;

---


And all my powers address your love and might,
To honor Helen, and to be her Knight.

---

## HERMIA:
Help me Lysander, help me; do thy best
To pluck this crawling serpent from my breast.

---


Aye me, for pity; what a dream was here?
Lysander look, how I do quake with fear:

---


Me-thought a serpent ate my heart away,
And yet sat smiling at his cruel prey.

---


Lysander, what removed? Lysander, Lord,
What, out of hearing, gone? No sound, no word?

---


Alack where are you? speak and if you hear:
Speake of all loves; I sound almost with fear.

---


No, then I well perceive you are not nigh,
Either death or you I will quickly find.

---

## BOTTOM:
Are we all met?

---

## QUINCE:
Pat, pat, and here's a marvelous convenient place for our rehearsal. This green plot shall be our stage, this hawthorne brake our tiring house, and we will do it in action, as we will do it before the Duke.

---

## BOTTOM:
Peter Quince?

---

## QUINCE:
What sayest thou, bully Bottom?

---

## BOTTOM:
There are things in this Comedy of Piramus and Thisby, that will never please. First, Piramus must draw a sword to kill himself; which the Ladies cannot abide. How answer you that?

---

## SNOUT:
Berlaken, a parlous fear.

---

## STARVELING:
I believe we must leave the killing out, when
all is done.

---

## BOTTOM:
Not a whit, I have a device to make all well. Write me a Prologue, and let the Prologue seem to say, we will do no harm with our swords, and that Pyramus is not kill'd indeed: and for the more better assurance, tell them, that I Piramus am not Piramus, but Bottom the Weaver; this will put them out of fear.

---

## QUINCE:
Well, we will have such a Prologue, and it shall be written in eight and six.

---

## BOTTOM:
No, make it two more, let it be written in eight and eight.

---

## SNOUT:
Will not the Ladies be afear'd of the Lion?

---

## STARVELING:
I fear it, I promise you.

---

## BOTTOM:
Masters, you ought to consider with your selves, to bring in (God shield us) a Lion among Ladies, is a most dreadful thing. For there is not a more fearful wild foule then your Lion living: and we ought to look to it.

---

## SNOUT:
Therefore another Prologue must tell he is not a Lion.

---

## BOTTOM:
Nay, you must name his name, and half his face must be seen through the Lion's neck, and he himself must speak through, saying thus, or to the same defect; Ladies, or faire Ladies, I would wish you, or I would request you, or I would entreat you, not to fear, not to tremble: my life for yours. If you think I come hither as a Lion, it were pity of my life. No, I am no such thing, I am a man as other men are; and there indeed let him name his name, and tell him plainly he is Snug the Joiner.

---

## QUINCE:
Well, it shall be so; but there is two hard things, that is, to bring the Moonlight into a chamber: for you know Piramus and Thisby meet by Moonlight.

---

## SNOUT:
Doth the Moon shine that night we play our play?

---

## BOTTOM:
A Calendar, a Calendar, look in the Almanack, find out Moonshine, find out Moonshine.

---

## QUINCE:
Yes, it doth shine that night.

---

## BOTTOM:
Why then may you leave a casement of the great chamber window (where we play) open, and the Moon may shine in at the casement.

---

## QUINCE:
I, or else one must come in with a bush of thorns and a lanthorne, and say he comes to disfigure, or to pre- sent the person of Moonshine. Then there is another thing, we must have a wall in the great Chamber; for Pi- ramus and Thisby (says the story) did talk through the break of a wall.

---

## SNOUT:
You can never bring in a wall. What say you Bottom?

---

## BOTTOM:
Some man or other must present wall, and let him have some Plaster, or some Lome, or some rough cast about him, to signify wall; or let him hold his fin- gers thus; and through that cranny shall Piramus and Thisby whisper.

---

## QUINCE:
If that may be, then all is well. Come, sit Down every mothers son, and rehearse your parts. Piramus, you begin; when you have spoken your speech, enter into that Brake, and so every one according to his cue.

---

## PUCK:
What hempen home-spuns have we swaggering here,
So near the Cradle of the Fairy Queene?

---


What, a Play toward? I’ll be an auditor,
An Actor too perhaps, if I see cause.

---

## QUINCE:
Speak Piramus: Thisby stand forth.

---

## BOTTOM:
Thisby, the flowers of odious savors sweet.

---

## QUINCE:
Odors, odors.

---

## BOTTOM:
Odors savors sweet,
So hath thy breath, my dearst Thisby dear.

---


But hark, a voice: stay thou but here a while,
And by and by I will to thee appear.

---

## PUCK:
A stranger Piramus, then ere played here.

---

## FLUTE:
Must I speak now?

---

## QUINCE:
I marry must you. For you must understand he goes but to see a noise that he heard, and is to come againe.

---

## FLUTE:
Most radiant Piramus, most lily white of hue,
Of color like the red rose on triumphant brier,
Most brisky Juvenal, and eke most lovely jewel,

---


As true as truest horse, that yet would never tire,
I’ll meet thee Piramus, at Ninnies tomb.

---

## QUINCE:
Ninus tomb man: why, you must not speak that yet; that you answer to Piramus: you speak all your part at once, cues and all. Piramus enter, your cue is past; it is never tire.

---

## FLUTE:
O, as true as truest horse, that yet would never
tire:

---

## BOTTOM:
If I were faire, Thisby I were only thine.

---

[SCREAMS AND SHOUTING]

---

## QUINCE:
O monstrous. O strange. We are haunted; pray masters, fly masters, help.

---

[MUSIC]

---

## PUCK:
I’ll follow you, I’ll lead you about a Round,
Through bog, through bush, through brake, through brier,
Sometime a horse I’ll be, sometime a hound:

---


A hog, a headless bear, sometime a fire,
And neigh, and bark, and grunt, and roar, and burn,
Like horse, hound, hog, bear, fire, at every turn.

---

[MORE YELLING]

---

## BOTTOM:
Why do they run away? This is a knavery of them to make me afeard.

---

## SNOUT:
O Bottom, thou art chang'd; What do I see on thee?

---

## BOTTOM:
What do you see? You see an Ass-head of your own, do you?

---

## QUINCE:
Bless thee Bottom, blesse thee; thou art translated.

---

## BOTTOM:
I see their knavery; this is to make an ass of me, to fright me if they could; but I will not stir from this place, do what they can. I will walk up and down here, and I will sing that they shall hear I am not afraid.

---


[SINGS]
The Woosell cock, so black of hew,
With Orange-tawny bill.

---


The Throstle, with his note so true,
The Wren and little quill.

---

## TITANIA:
What Angel wakes me from my flowery bed?

---

## BOTTOM:
[SINGS LOUDER]
The Finch, the Sparrow, and the Lark,
The plainsong Cuckoo gray;

---


Whose note full many a man doth mark,
And dares not answer, nay.

---

## TITANIA:
I pray thee gentle mortal, sing again,
Mine ear is much enamored of thy note;
So is mine eye enthralled to thy shape.

---


And thy fair virtues force (perforce) doth move me.
On the first view to say, to swear I love thee.

---

## BOTTOM:
Me-thinks mistress, you should have little reason for that: and yet to say the truth, reason and love keep little company together, now-adays. The more the pittie, that some honest neighbors will not make them friends. Nay, I can gleeke upon occasion.

---

## TITANIA:
Thou art as wise, as thou art beautiful.

---

## BOTTOM:
Not so neither: but if I had wit enough to get out of this wood, I have enough to serve mine own turn.

---

## TITANIA:
Out of this wood, do not desire to go,
Thou shalt remain here, whether thou wilt or no.

---


I am a spirit of no common rate:
The Summer still doth tend upon my state,

---


And I do love thee; therefore go with me,
I'll give thee Fairies to attend on thee;

---


And I will purge thy mortal grossness so,
That thou shalt like an airy spirit go.

---

## PEASEBLOSSOM:
Ready.

---

## COBWEB:
and I.

---


## MOTH:
and I.

---

## MUSTARDSEED:
and I.

---

## FAIRY 1:
Where shall we go?

---

## TITANIA:
Be kind and courteous to this Gentleman,
Nod to him Elves, and do him courtesies.

---



## PEASEBLOSSOM:
Hail mortal, hail.

---

## COBWEB:
Hail.

---

## MOTH:
Hail.

---

## BOTTOM:
I cry your worships mercy heartily; I beseech your worship’s name.

---

## COBWEB:
Cobweb.

---

## BOTTOM:
I shall desire you of more acquaintance, good Master Cobweb: if I cut my finger, I shall make bold with you. Your name honest Gentleman?

---

## PEASEBLOSSOM:
Peaseblossom.

---

## BOTTOM:
I pray you commend me to mistresses Squash, your mother, and to master Peascod your father. Good master Peaseblossom, I shall desire of you more acquaintance too. Your name I beseech you sir?

---


## MUSTARDSEED:
Mustardseed.

---

## BOTTOM:
Good master Mustardseed, I know your patience well: that same cowardly giant-like Ox beef hath devoured many a gentleman of your house. I promise you, your kindred hath made my eyes water ere now. I desire you more acquaintance, good Master Mustardseed.

---

## TITANIA:
Come wait Upon him, lead him to my bower.
The Moon me-thinks, looks with a watery eye,
And when she weeps, weeps every little flower,

---


Lamenting some enforced chastity.
Tie up my lover’s tongue, bring him silently.

---

[MUSIC]

---


[MUSIC FADES]

---
---

[MUSIC]

---

## OBERON:
I wonder if Titania be awak't;
Then what it was that next came in her eye,
Which she must dote on, in extremity.

---


Here comes my messenger: how now mad spirit,
What night-rule now about this haunted grove?

---

## PUCK:
My Mistress with a monster is in love,
Near to her close and consecrated bower,

---


While she was in her dull and sleeping hour,
A crew of patches, rude Mechanicals,

---


That work for bread upon Athenian stalls,
Were met together to rehearse a Play,
Intended for great Theseus nuptial day:

---


The shallowest thick-skin of that barren sort,
Who Piramus presented, in their sport,

---


Forsook his Scene, and entered in a brake,
When I did him at this advantage take,

---


An Ass's nole I fixed on his head.
Anon his Thisby must be answered,

---


And forth my Mimic comes: when they him spy,
As Wild-geese, that the creeping Fowler eye,

---


So at his sight, away his fellows fly,
For briars and thorns at their apparel snatch,

---


Some sleeves, some hats, from yielders all things catch,
I led them on in this distracted fear,
And left sweet Piramus translated there:

---


When in that moment (so it came to pass)
Titania waked, and straightway loved an Ass.

---

## OBERON:
This falls out better then I could devise:
But hast thou yet latched the Athenian’s eyes,
With the love juice, as I bid thee doe?

---

## PUCK:
I took him sleeping (that is finished too)
And the Athenian woman by his side,
That when he waked, of force she must be eyed.

---

## OBERON:
Stand close, this is the same Athenian.

---

## PUCK:
This is the woman, but not this the man.

---

## DEMETRIUS:
O why rebuke you him that loves you so?
Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe.

---

## HERMIA:
Now I but chide, but I should use thee worse.
For thou (I fear) hast given me cause to curse,

---


If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep,
Being ore shoes in blood, plunge in the deep, and kill me too:

---


The Sun was not so true unto the day,
As he to me. Would he have stolen away,

---


From sleeping Hermia? I’ll believe as soon
This whole earth may be bord, and that the Moon

---


May through the Center creep, and so displease
Her brothers noontide, with th' Antipodes.

---


It cannot be but thou hast murdered him,
So should a murderer look, so dead, so grim.

---

## DEMETRIUS:
So should the murderer look, and so should I,
Pierced through the heart with your stern cruelty:

---


Yet you the murderer looks as bright as clear,
As yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere.

---

## HERMIA:
What's this to my Lysander? Where is he?
Ah good Demetrius, wilt thou give him me?

---

## DEMETRIUS:
I'd rather give his carcasses to my hounds.

---

## HERMIA:
Out dog, out cur, thou driv’st me past the bounds
Of maiden's patience. Hast thou slain him then?
Henceforth be never numbered among men.

---


Oh, once tell true, even for my sake,
Durst thou a lookt upon him, being awake?

---


And hast thou kill'd him sleeping? O brave touch:
Could not a worm, an Adder do so much?

---


An Adder did it: for with doubler tongue
Then thine (thou serpent) never Adder stung.

---

## DEMETRIUS:
You spend your passion on a misprised mood,
I am not guilty of Lysanders blood:
Nor is he dead for ought that I can tell.

---

## HERMIA:
I pray thee tell me then that he is well.

---

## DEMETRIUS:
And if I could, what should I get therefore?

---

## HERMIA:
A privilege, never to see me more;
And from thy hated presence part I: see me no more
Whether he be dead or no.

---

## DEMETRIUS:
There is no following her in this fierce vain,
Here therefore for a while I will remain.

---

## OBERON:
What hast thou done? Thou hast mistaken quite
And laid the love juice on some true loves sight:

---


Of thy misprision, must perforce ensue
Some true love turn'd, and not a false turn'd true.

---

## PUCK:
Then fate ore-rules, that one man holding troth,
A million fail, confounding oath on oath.

---

## OBERON:
About the wood, go swifter then the wind,
And Helena of Athens look thou find.

---


All fancy sick she is, and pale of cheer,
With sighs of love, that costs the fresh blood dear.

---


By some illusion see thou bring her here,
I’ll charm his eyes against she doth appear.

---

## PUCK:
I go, I go, look how I go,
Swifter then arrow from the Cupid’s bow.

---

## OBERON:
Flower of this purple dye,
Hit with Cupid's archery,

---


Sink in apple of his eye,
When his love he doth espy,

---


Let her shine as gloriously
As the Venus of the sky.

---


When thou wak'st if she be by,
Beg of her for remedy - di.

---

## PUCK:
Captain of our Fairy band,
Helena is here at hand,

---


And the youth, mistook by me,
Pleading for a Lover’s fee.

---


Shall we their fond Pageant see?
Lord, what fools these mortals be!

---

## OBERON:
Stand aside: the noise they make,
Will cause Demetrius to awake.

---

## PUCK:
Then will two at once woo one,
That must needs be sport alone:

---


And those things do best please me,
That befall preposterously.

---

## LYSANDER:
Why should you think yet I should woo in scorn?
Scorn and derision never comes in tears:

---


Look when I vow I weep; and vows so borne,
In their nativity all truth appears.

---


How can these things in me, seem scorn to you?
Bearing the badge of faith to prove them true.

---

## HELENA:
You do advance your cunning more & more,
When truth kills truth, O devilish holy fray!

---


These vows are Hermia’s. Will you give her ore?
Weigh oath with oath, and you will nothing weigh.

---


Your vows to her, and me, (put in two scales)
Will even weigh, and both as light as tales.

---

## LYSANDER:
I had no judgment, when to her I swore.

---

## HELENA:
Nor none in my mind, now you give her ore.

---

## LYSANDER:
Demetrius loves her, and he loves not you.

---

## DEMETRIUS:
O Helen, goddess, nymph, perfect, divine,
To what my, love, shall I compare thine eyne!

---


Crystal is muddy, O how ripe in show,
Thy lips, those kissing cherries, tempting grow!

---


That pure congealed white, high Taurus snow,
Fan'd with the Eastern wind, turns to a crow,

---


When thou holdst up thy hand. O let me kiss
This Princess of pure white, this seal of bliss.

---

## HELENA:
O spite! O hell! I see you are all bent
To set against me, for your merriment:

---


If you were civil, and knew courtesy,
You would not do me thus much injury.

---


Can you not hate me, as I know you do,
But you must join in souls to mock me to?

---


If you are men, as men you are in show,
You would not use a gentle Lady so;

---


To vow, and swear, and super-praise my parts,
When I am sure you hate me with your hearts.

---


You both are Rivals, and love Hermia;
And now both Rivals to mock Helena.

---


A trim exploit, a manly enterprise,
To conjure tears up in a poor maids eyes,

---


With your derision; none of noble sort,
Would so offend a Virgin, and extort
A poor souls patience, all to make you sport.

---

## LYSANDER:
You are unkind Demetrius; be not so,
For you love Hermia; this you know I know;

---


And here with all good will, with all my heart,
In Hermia’s love I yield you up my part;

---


And yours of Helena, to me bequeath,
Whom I do love, and will do to my death.

---

## HELENA:
Never did mockers waste more idle breath.

---

## DEMETRIUS:
Lysander, keep thy Hermia, I will none:
If ere I lov’d her, all that love is gone.

---


My heart to her, but as guest-wise sojourned,
And now to Helen it is home return'd,
There to remain.

---

## LYSANDER:
It is not so.

---

## DEMETRIUS:
Disparage not the faith thou dost not know,
Lest to thy peril thou abide it dear.
Look where thy Love comes, yonder is thy dear.

---

## HERMIA:
Dark night, that from the eye his function takes,
The ear more quick of apprehension makes,

---


Wherein it doth impair the seeing sense,
It pays the hearing double recompense.

---


Thou art not by mine eye, Lysander found,
Mine ear (I thank it) brought me to that sound.
But why unkindly didst thou leave me so?

---

## LYSANDER:
Why should he stay whom Love doth press to go?

---

## HERMIA:
What love could press Lysander from my side?

---

## LYSANDER:
Lysander’s love (that would not let him bide)
Faire Helena; who more engilds the night,
Then all yon fiery oes, and eyes of light.

---


Why seek'st thou me? Could not this make thee know,
The hate I bare thee, made me leave thee so?

---

## HERMIA:
You speak not as you think; it cannot be.

---

## HELENA:
Lo, she is one of this confederacy,
Now I perceive they have conjoined all three,
To fashion this false sport in spite of me.

---


Injurious Hermia, most ungrateful maid,
Have you conspired, have you with these contrived
To bait me, with this foul derision?

---


Is all the counsel that we two have shar'd,
The sisters vows, the hours that we have spent,

---


When we have chid the hasty footed time,
For parting us; O, is all forgot?

---


All school days friendship, child-hood innocence?
And will you rent our ancient love asunder,
To join with men in scorning your poor friend?

---


It is not friendly, 'tis not maidenly.
Our sexes as well as I, may chide you for it,
Though I alone do feel the injury.

---

## HERMIA:
I am amazed at your passionate words,
I scorn you not; It seems that you scorn me.

---

## HELENA:
Have you not set Lysander, as in scorn
To follow me, and praise my eyes and face?

---


And made your other love, Demetrius
(Who even but now did spurn me with his foot)

---


To call me goddess, nymph, divine, and rare,
Precious, celestial? Wherefore speakers he this

---


To her he hates? and wherefore doth Lysander
Deniy your love (so rich within his soul)

---


And tender me (forsooth) affection,
But by your setting on, by your consent?

---


What though I be not so in grace as you,
So hung upon with love, so fortunate?

---


(But miserable most, to love unloved)
This you should pittie, rather then despise.

---

## HERMIA:
I understand not what you mean by this.

---

## HELENA:
I, do, persevere, counterfeit sad looks,
Make mouth upon me when I turn my back,

---


Winke each at other, hold the sweet jest up:
This sport well carried, shall be chronicled.

---


If you have any pittie, grace, or manners,
You would not make me such an argument:

---


But fare ye well, 'tis partly mine own fault,
Which death or absence soon shall remedy.

---

## LYSANDER:
Stay gentle Helena, hear my excuse,
My love, my life, my soul, faire Helena.

---

## HELENA:
O excellent!

---

## HERMIA:
Sweet, do not scorn her so.

---

## DEMETRIUS:
If she cannot entreat, I can compel.

---

## LYSANDER:
Thou canst compel, no more then she entreat.
Thy threats have no more strength then her weak praise.

---


Helen, I love thee, by my life I do;
I swear by that which I will lose for thee,
To prove him false, that says I love thee not.

---

## DEMETRIUS:
I say, I love thee more then he can do.

---

## LYSANDER:
If thou say so, with-draw and prove it too.

---

## DEMETRIUS:
Quick, come.

---

## HERMIA:
Lysander, whereto tends all this?

---

## LYSANDER:
Hang off thou cat, thou bur; vile thing let loose,
Or I will shake thee from me like a serpent.

---

## HERMIA:
Do you not jest?


---

## HELENA:
Yes sooth, and so do you.

---

## LYSANDER:
Demetrius: I will keep my word with thee.

---

## DEMETRIUS:
I would I had your bond: for I perceive
A weak bond holds you; I’ll not trust your word.

---

## LYSANDER:
What, should I hurt her, strike her, kill her dead?
Although I hate her, I’ll not harm her so.

---

## HERMIA:
What, can you do me greater harm then hate?
Hate me, wherefore? O me, what news my Love?

---


Am not I Hermia? Are not you Lysander?
I am as fair now, as I was ere while.

---


Since night you loved me; yet since night you left me.
Why then you left me (O the gods forbid)
In earnest, shall I say?

---

## LYSANDER:
I, by my life;
And never did desire to see thee more.

---


Therefore be out of hope, of question, of doubt;
Be certain, nothing truer: 'tis no jest,
That I do hate thee, and love Helena.

---

## HERMIA:
O me, you juggler, you canker blossom,
You thief of love; What, have you come by night,
And stolen my loves heart from him?

---

## HELENA:
Fine I’faith:
Have you no modesty, no maiden shame,

---


No touch of bashfulness? What, will you tear
Impatient answers from my gentle tongue?

---


Fie, fie, you counterfeit, you puppet, you.

---

## HERMIA:
Puppet? why so? I, that way goes the game.
Now I perceive that she hath made compare
Between our statures, she hath urg'd her height,

---


And with her personage, her tall personage,
Her height (forsooth) she hath prevailed with him.

---


And are you grown so high in his esteem,
Because I am so little, and so low?

---


How low am I, thou painted maypole? Speake,
How low am I? I am not yet so low,
But that my nails can reach unto thine eyes.

---

## HELENA:
I pray you though you mock me, gentlemen,
Let her not hurt me; I was never curst:

---


I have no gift at all in shrewishness;
I am a right maid for my cowardice;

---


Let her not strike me: you perhaps may think,
Because she is something lower then myself,
That I can match her.

---

## HERMIA:
Lower? hark again.

---

## HELENA:
Good Hermia, do not be so bitter with me,
I evermore did love you Hermia,

---


Did ever keep your counsels, never wronged you,
Save that in love unto Demetrius,

---


I told him of your stealth unto this wood.
He followed you, for love I followed him,

---


But he hath chid me hence, and threatened me
To strike me, spurn me, nay to kill me too;

---


And now, so you will let me quiet go,
To Athens will I bear my folly back,

---


And follow you no further.  Let me go.
You see how simple, and how fond I am.

---

## HERMIA:
Why get you gone: who ist that hinders you?

---

## HELENA:
A foolish heart, that I leave here behind.

---

## HERMIA:
What, with Lysander?

---

## HELENA:
With Demetrius.

---

## LYSANDER:
Be not afraid, she shall not harm thee Helena.

---

## DEMETRIUS:
No sir, she shall not, though you take her part.

---

## HELENA:
O when she's angry, she is keen and shrewd,
She was a vixen when she went to school,
And though she be but little, she is fierce.

---

## HERMIA:
Little again? Nothing but low and little?
Why will you suffer her to flout me thus?
Let me come to her.

---

## LYSANDER:
Get you gone you runt,
You minimus, of hindering knot-grass made,
You bead, you acorn.

---

## DEMETRIUS:
You are too officious,
In her behalf that scorns your services.

---


Let her alone, speak not of Helena,
Take not her part. For if thou dost intend

---


Never so little show of love to her,
Thou shalt abide it.

---

## LYSANDER:
Now she holds me not,
Now follow if thou dar'st, to try who’s right,
Of thine or mine is most in Helena.

---

## DEMETRIUS:
Follow? Nay, I’ll go with thee cheek by jowl.

---

## HERMIA:
You Mistress, all this coil is long of you.
Nay, go not back.

---

## HELENA:
I will not trust you I,
Nor longer stay in your curst company.

---


Your hands then mine, are quicker for a fray,
My legs are longer though to run away.

---

## OBERON:
This is thy negligence, still thou mistak'st,
Or else committ'st thy knaveries willingly.

---

## PUCK:
Believe me, King of shadows, I mistook,
Did not you tell me, I should know the man,

---


By the Athenian garments he hath on?
And so far blameless proves my enterprise,

---


That I have nointed an Athenians eyes,
And so far am I glad, it so did sort,
As this their jangling I esteem a sport.

---

## OBERON:
Thou seest these Lovers seek a place to fight,
Hie therefore Robin, Overcast the night,

---


And lead these testy Rivals so astray,
As one come not within another's way.

---


Like to Lysander, sometime frame thy tongue,
Then stir Demetrius up with bitter wrong;

---


And sometime rail thou like Demetrius;
And from each other look thou lead them thus,

---


Till ore their brows, death-counterfeiting, sleep
With leaden legs, and Battie-wings doth creep:

---


Then crush this herb into Lysander's eye,
Whose liquor hath this virtuous property,

---


To take from thence all error, with his might,
And make his eye-balls role with wonted sight.

---


When they next wake, all this derision
Shall seem a dream, and fruitless vision,

---


And back to Athens shall the Lovers wend
With league, whose date till death shall never end.

---


Whiles I in this affaire do thee imply,
Ile to my Queene, and beg her Indian Boy;

---


And then I will her charmed eye release
From monsters view, and all things shall be peace.

---

[LOW RUMBLING MUSIC]

---

## PUCK:
Up and down, up and down, I will lead them up and down: I am feared in field and town. Robin, lead them up and down: here comes one.

---

## LYSANDER:
Where art thou, proud Demetrius?
Speake thou now.

---

## PUCK:
(in Demetrius' Voice)
Here villain, drawn & ready. Where art thou?

---

## LYSANDER:
 I will be with thee straight.

---

## PUCK:
(in Demetrius' Voice)
Follow me then to plainer ground.

---

## DEMETRIUS:
Lysander, speak again;
Thou runaway, thou coward, art thou fled?
Speake in some bush: Where dost thou hide thy head?

---

## PUCK:
(in Lysander’s Voice)
Thou coward, art thou bragging to the stars,
Telling the bushes that thou look'st for wars,

---


And wilt not come? Come recreant, come thou child,
I’ll whip thee with a rod. He is defiled
That draws a sword on thee.

---

## DEMETRIUS:
Yea, art thou there?

---

## PUCK:
(in Lysander’s Voice)
Follow my voice, we’ll try no manhood here.

---

## LYSANDER:
He goes before me, and still dares me on,
When I come where he calls, then he's gone.

---


The villain is much lighter heel’d then I:
I followed fast, but faster he did fly;

---


That fallen am I in dark uneven way,
And here will rest me. Come thou gentle day:

---


For if but once thou show me thy gray light,
I’ll find Demetrius, and revenge this spite.

---

## PUCK:
(in Lysander’s Voice)
Ho, ho, ho; coward, why com'st thou not?

---

## DEMETRIUS:
Abide me, if thou dar'st. For well I wot,
Thou run’st before me, shifting every place,

---


And dar'st not stand, nor look me in the face.
Where art thou?

---

## PUCK:
(in Lysander’s Voice)
Come hither, I am here.

---

## DEMETRIUS:
Nay then thou mock'st me; thou shalt buy this deere,
If ever I thy face by day-light see.

---


Now go thy way: faintness constraineth me,
To measure out my length on this cold bed,
By days approach look to be visited.

---

## HELENA:
O weary night, O long and tedious night,
Abate thy hours, shine comforts from the East,

---


That I may back to Athens by day-light,
From these that my poor company detest;

---


And sleep that sometime shuts up sorrows eye,
Steal me a while from mine own company.

---

## PUCK:
Yet but three? Come one more,
Two of both kinds makes up four.

---


Here she comes, curst and sad,
Cupid is a knavish lad,
Thus to make poor females mad.

---

## HERMIA:
Never so weary, never so in woe,
Bedabbled with the dew, and torn with briars,

---


I can no further crawl, no further go;
My legs can keep no pace with my desires.

---


Here will I rest me till the break of day,
Heavens shield Lysander, if they mean a fray.

---

## PUCK:
On the ground sleep sound,
I’ll apply your eye gentle lover, remedy.

---


When thou wak'st, thou tak'st
True delight in the sight of thy former Ladies eye,

---


And the Country Proverb known,
That every man should take his own,

---


In your waking shall be shown.
Jack shall have Jill, nought shall go ill.
The man shall have his Mare again, and all shall be well.

---

[MUSIC]

---

## TITANIA:
Come, sit thee down upon this flowery bed,
While I thy amiable cheeks do coy,

---


And stick musk roses in thy sleek smooth head,
And kiss thy faire large ears, my gentle joy.

---

## BOTTOM:
Where's Peaseblossom?

---

## PEASEBLOSSOM: 
Ready.

---

## BOTTOM:
Scratch my head, Pease-blossom. Where’s Monsieur Cobweb.

---

## COBWEB:
Ready.

---

## BOTTOM:
Monsieur Cobweb, good Monsieur get your weapons in your hand, & kill me a red hipt humble-Bee, on the top of a thistle; and good Monsieur bring mee the honey bag. do not fret your self too much in the action, Monsieur; and good Monsieur have a care the honey bag break not, I would be loath to have yon Over - flown with a honey-bag signature. Where's Monsieur Mustardseed?

---

## MUSTARDSEED:
Ready.

---

## BOTTOM:
Give me your neafe, Monsieur Mustardseed.
Pray you leave your courtesy good Monsieur.

---

## MUSTARDSEED:
What's your will?

---

## BOTTOM:
Nothing good Monsieur, but to help Cavalry Cobweb to scratch. I must to the Barber's Monsieur, for me-thinks I am marvelous hairy about the face. And I am such a tender ass, if my hair do but tickle me, I must scratch.

---

## TITANIA:
What, wilt thou hear some music, my sweet love.

---

## BOTTOM:
I have a reasonable good ear in music. Let us have the tongs and the bones.

---

## TITANIA:
Or say sweet Love, what thou desirest to eat.

---

## BOTTOM:
Truly a peck of Provender; I could munch your good dry Oates. Me-thinks I have a great desire to a bottle of hay: good hay, sweet hay hath no fellow.

---

## TITANIA:
I have a venturous Fairy,
That shall seek the Squirrels hoard,
And fetch thee new Nuts.

---

## BOTTOM:
I had rather have a handful or two of dried peas. But I pray you let none of your people stir me, I have an exposition of sleep come upon me.

---

## TITANIA:
Sleep thou, and I will wind thee in my arms,
Fairies be gone, and be always away.
So doth the woodbine, the sweet Honeysuckle,
Gently entwist; the female Ivy so
Enrings the barky fingers of the Elm.
O how I love thee! how I dote on thee!

---

## OBERON:
Welcome good Robin:
Seest thou this sweet sight?
Her dotage now I do begin to pity.
For meeting her of late behind the wood,
Seeking sweet savors for this hateful fool,
I did upbraid her, and fall out with her.
For she his hairy temples then had rounded,
With coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers.
When I had at my pleasure taunted her,
And she in mild terms begged my patience,
I then did ask of her, her changeling child,
Which straight she gave me, and her Fairy sent
To bear him to my Bower in Fairy Land.
And now I have the Boy, I will undo
This hateful imperfection of her eyes.
And gentle Puck, take this transformed scalp,
From off the head of this Athenian swaine;
That he awaking when the other doe,
May all to Athens back again repair,
And think no more of this nights accidents,
But as the fierce vexation of a dream.
But first I will release the Fairy Queen.
Be thou as thou wast wont to be;
See as thou wast wont to see.
Diane’s bud, or Cupid's flower,
Hath such force and blessed power.
Now my Titania wake you my sweet Queen.

---

## TITANIA:
My Oberon, what visions have I seen!
Me-thought I was enamored of an Ass.

---

## OBERON:
There lies your love.

---

## TITANIA:
How came these things to passe?
Oh, how mine eyes doth loath this visage now!

---

## OBERON:
Silence a while. Robin take off his head:

---

## PUCK:
When thou wak'st, with thine own fools eyes Peep

---

## OBERON:
Come my Queen, take hands with me.
Now thou and I new in amity,
And will to morrow midnight, solemnly
Dance in Duke Theseus house triumphantly,
And blesse it to all fair posterity.
There shall the pairs of faithful Lovers be
Wedded, with Theseus, all in jollity.

---

## PUCK:
Fair King attend, and mark,
I do hear the morning Lark.

---

## OBERON:
Then my Queene in silence sad,
Trip we after the nights shade;
We the Globe can compass soon,
Swifter then the wandering Moon.

---

## TITANIA:
Come my Lord, and in our flight,
Tell me how it came this night,
That I sleeping here was found,
With these mortals on the ground.

---

## BOTTOM:
When my cue comes, call me, and I will answer. My next is, most faire Piramus. Hey ho. Peter Quince? Flute the bellows-mender? Snout the tinker? Starveling? Gods my life! Stolen hence, and left me asleep: I have had a most rare vision. I had a dream, past the wit of man, to say, what dream it was. Man is but an Ass, if he go about to expound this dream. Me-thought I was, there is no man can tell what. Me-thought I was, and me-thought I had. But man is but a patch'd fool, if he will offer to say, what me-thought I had. The eye of man hath not heard, the ear of man hath not seen, mans hand is not able to taste, his tongue to conceive, nor his heart to report, what my dream was. I will get Peter Quince to write a ballet of this dream, it shall be called Bottoms Dream, because it hath no Bottom; and I will sing it in the latter end of a play, before the Duke. Per- adventure, to make it the more gracious, I shall sing it at her death.


---

## THESEUS:
Go one of you, find out the Forrester,
My Love shall hear the music of my hounds.
Uncouple in the Western valley, let them go;
Dispatch I say, and find the Forrester.
We will faire Queen, up to the Mountains top,
And mark the musical confusion
Of hounds and echo in conjunction. 

---

## HIPPOLYTA:
I was with Hercules and Cadmus once.
When in a wood of Crete they bayed the Bear
With hounds of Sparta; never did I hear
Such gallant chiding. For besides the groves,
The skies, the fountains, every region near,
Seem all one mutual cry. I never heard
So musical a discord, such sweet thunder.

---

## THESEUS:
My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind,
So flew'd, so sanded, and their heads are hung
With ears that sweep away the morning dew,
Crooke kneed, and dew-lapt, like Thessalian Buls,
Slow in pursuit, but matched in mouth like bells;
Judge when you hear. But soft, what nymphs are these?

---

## EGEUS:
My Lord, this is my daughter here asleep,
And this Lysander, this Demetrius is,
This Helena, olde Nedar's Helena,
I wonder of this being here together.

---

## THESEUS:
No doubt they rose up early, to observe
The right of May; and hearing our intent,
Came here in grace of our solemnity.
But speak Egeus, is not this the day
That Hermia should give answer of her choice?

---

## EGEUS:
It is, my Lord.

---

## THESEUS:
Go bid the hunts-men wake them with their horns.

---

## THESEUS:
Good morrow friends: Saint Valentine is past,
Begin these wood birds but to couple now?

---

## LYSANDER:
Pardon my Lord.

---

## THESEUS:
I pray you all stand up.
I know you two are Rival enemies.
How comes this gentle concord in the world,
That hatred is is so far from jealousy,
To sleep by hate, and fear no enmity.

---

## LYSANDER:
My Lord, I shall reply amazedly,
Half sleep, half waking. But as yet, I swear,
I cannot truly say how I came here.
But as I think (for truly would I speak)
And now I do bethink me, so it is;
I came with Hermia hither.  Our intent
Was to be gone from Athens, where we might be
Without the peril of the Athenian Law.

---

## EGEUS:
Enough, enough, my Lord: you have enough;
I beg the Law, the Law, upon his head:
They would have stolen away, they would Demetrius,
Thereby to have defeated you and me:
You of your wife, and me of my consent;
Of my consent, that she should be your wife.

---

## DEMETRIUS:
My Lord, fair Helen told me of their stealth,
Of this their purpose hither, to this wood,
And I in fury hither followed them;
Faire Helena, in fancy followed me.
But my good Lord, I wot not by what power,
(But by some power it is) my love
To Hermia (melted as the snow)
Seems to me now as the remembrance of an idle gaud,
Which in my childhood I did doat upon:
And all the faith, the virtue of my heart,
The object and the pleasure of mine eye,
Is only Helena. To her, my Lord,
Was I betroth'd, ere I see Hermia,
But like a sickness did I loath this food,
But as in health, come to my natural taste,
Now do I wish it, love it, long for it,
And will for evermore be true to it.

---

## THESEUS:
Faire Lovers, you are fortunately met;
Of this discourse we shall hear more anon.
Egeus, I will Over -bear your will;
For in the Temple, by and by with us,
These couples shall eternally be knit.
And for the morning now is something worn,
Our purpos'd hunting shall be set aside.
Away, with us to Athens; three and three,
We'll hold a feast in great solemnity.
Come Hippolita.

---

## DEMETRIUS:
These things seem small & undistinguishable,
Like far off mountains turned into Clouds.

---

## HERMIA:
Me-thinks I see these things with parted eye,
When every things seems double.

---

## HELENA:
So me-thinks:
And I have found Demetrius, like a jewel,
Mine own, and not mine own.

---

## DEMETRIUS:
It seems to mee,
That yet we sleep, we dream. Do not you think,
The Duke was here, and bid us follow him?

---

## HERMIA:
Yea, and my Father.

---

## HELENA:
And Hippolita.

---

## LYSANDER:
And he bid us follow to the Temple.

---

## DEMETRIUS:
Why then we are awake; lets follow him, and by the way let us recount our dreams.

---


[MUSIC]

---

## QUINCE:
Have you sent to Bottoms house? Is he come home yet?

---

## STARVELING:
He cannot be heard of. Out of doubt he is transported.

---

## FLUTE:
If he come not, then the play is mar'd. It goes not forward, doth it?

---

## QUINCE:
It is not possible: you have not a man in all Athens, able to discharge Piramus but he.

---

## FLUTE:
No, he hath simply the best wit of any handy- craft man in Athens.

---

## QUINCE:
Yea, and the best person too, and he is a very Paramour, for a sweet voice.

---

## FLUTE:
You must say, Paragon. A Paramour is (God blesse us) a thing of nought.

---

## SNUG:
Masters, the Duke is coming from the Temple, and there is two or three Lords & Ladies more married. If our sport had gone forward, we had all been made men.

---

## FLUTE:
O sweet bully Bottom: thus hath he lost six-pence a day, during his life; he could not have scaped six-pence a day. And the Duke had not given him sixpence a day for playing Piramus, I’ll be hang'd. He would have deserved it. Six-pence a day in Piramus, or nothing.

---

## BOTTOM:
Where are these Lads? Where are these hearts?

---

[JOYFUL CRIES AND CHEERS]

---

## QUINCE:
Bottom, O most courageous day! O most happy hour!

---

## BOTTOM:
Masters, I am to discourse wonders; but ask me not what. For if I tell you, I am no true Athenian. I will tell you every thing as it fell out.

---

## QUINCE:
Let us hear, sweet Bottom.

---

## BOTTOM:
Not a word of me: all that I will tell you, is, that the Duke hath dined. Get your apparel together, good strings to your beards, new ribbands to your pumps, meet presently at the Palace, every man look ore his part: for the short and the long is, our play is preferred: In any case let Thisby have clean linen: and let not him that plays the Lion, pair his nails, for they shall hang out for the Lions claws. And most dear Actors, eat no Onions, nor Garlic; for wee are to utter sweet breath, and I do not doubt but to hear them say, it is a sweet Comedy. No more words: away, go away.

---


[MUSIC]

---

## HIPPOLYTA:
'Tis strange my Theseus, that these lovers speak of.

---

## THESEUS:
More strange then true. I never may believe
These antick fables, nor these Fairy toys,
Lovers and mad men have such seething brains,
Such shaping phantasies, that apprehend more
Then cool reason ever comprehends.
The Lunatic, the Lover, and the Poet,
Are of imagination all compact.
One sees more devils then vast hell can hold;
That is the mad man. The Lover, all as frantic,
The Poets eye in a fine frenzy rolling, doth glance
From heaven to earth, from earth to heaven.
And as imagination bodies forth the forms of things
Unknown; the Poets pen turns them to shapes,
And gives to air nothing, a local habitation,
And a name. Such tricks hath strong imagination,
That if it would but apprehend some joy,
It comprehends some bringer of that joy.
Or in the night, imagining some fear,
Howe easy is a bush suppos'd a Bear?

---

## HIPPOLYTA:
But all the story of the night told over,
And all their minds transfigured so together,
More witnesseth than fancies images,
And grows to something of great constancy;
But howsoever, strange, and admirable.

---

## THESEUS:
Here come the lovers, full of joy and mirth:
Joy, gentle friends, joy and fresh days
Of love accompany your hearts.

---

## LYSANDER:
More then to us, wait in your royal walks,
your board, your bed.

---

## THESEUS:
Come now, what makes, what dances shall we have,
To wear away this long age of three hours,
Between our after supper, and bed-time?
Where is our usual manager of mirth?
What Revels are in hand? Is there no play,
To ease the anguish of a torturing hour?
Call Egeus.

---

## EGEUS:
Heere mighty Theseus.

---

## THESEUS:
Say, what abridgement have you for this evening?
What mask? What music? How shall we beguile
The lazy time, if not with some delight?

---

## EGEUS:
There is a brief how many sports are rife:
Make choice of which your Highness will see first.

---

## LYSANDER:
The battle with the Centaurs to be sung
By an Athenian Eunuch, to the Harp.

---

## THESEUS:
We’ll none of that. That have I told my Love
In glory of my kinsman Hercules.

---

## LYSANDER:
The riot of the tipsy Bacchanals,
Tearing the Thracian singer, in their rage?

---

## THESEUS:
That is an old device, and it was played
When I from Thebes came last a Conqueror.

---

## LYSANDER:
The thrice three Muses, mourning for the death
of learning, late deceased in beggary.

---

## THESEUS:
That is some Satire keen and critical,
Not sorting with a nuptial ceremony.

---

## LYSANDER:
A tedious brief Scene of young Piramus,
And his love Thisby; very tragical mirth.

---

## THESEUS:
Merry and tragical? Tedious, and brief? That is, hot ice, and wondrous strange snow. How shall we find the concord of this discord?

---

## EGEUS:
A play there is, my Lord, some ten words long,
Which is as brief, as I have known a play;
But by ten words, my Lord, it is too long;
Which makes it tedious. For in all the play,
There is not one word apt, one Player fitted.
And tragical my noble Lord it is: for Piramus
Therein doth kill himself. Which when I saw
Rehearsed, I must confess, made mine eyes water:
But more marry tears, the passion of loud laughter
Never shed.

---

## THESEUS:
What are they that do play it?

---

## EGEUS:
Hard handed men, that work in Athens here,
Which never labored in their minds till now;
And now have toiled their unbreathed memories
With this same play, against your nuptial.

---

## THESEUS:
And we will hear it.

---

## EGEUS:
No my noble Lord, it is not for you. I have heard
It over, and it is nothing, nothing in the world;

---

## THESEUS:
I will hear that play. For never any thing
Can be amiss, when simpleness and duty tender it.
Go bring them in, and take your places, Ladies.

---

## HIPPOLYTA:
I love not to see wretchedness orecharged;
And duty in his service perishing.

---

## THESEUS:
Why gentle sweet, you shall see no such thing.

---

## HIPPOLYTA:
He says, they can do nothing in this kind.

---

## THESEUS:
The kinder we, to give them thanks for nothing
Our sport shall be, to take what they mistake;
And what poor duty cannot doe, noble respect
Takes it in might, not merit.
Where I have come, great Clerks have purposed
To greet me with premeditated welcomes;
Where I have seen them shiver and look pale,
Make periods in the midst of sentences,
Throttle their practic’d accent in their fears,
And in conclusion, dumbly have broke off,
Not paying me a welcome. Trust me sweet,
Out of this silence yet, I picked a welcome:
And in the modesty of fearful duty,
I read as much, as from the rattling tongue
Of saucy and audacious eloquence.
Love therefore, and tongue-tide simplicity,
In least, speak most, to my capacity.

---

## EGEUS:
So please your Grace, the Prologue is addressed.

---

## THESEUS:
Let him approach.


---

## QUINCE:
If we offend, it is with our good will.
That you should think, we come not to offend,
But with good will. To shew our simple skill,
That is the true beginning of our end.
Consider then, we come but in despite.
We do not come, as minding to content you,
Our true intent is. All for your delight,
We are not here. That you should here repent you,
The Actors are at hand; and by their show,
You shall know all, that you are like to know.

---

## THESEUS:
This fellow doth not stand upon points.

---

## LYSANDER:
He hath rid his Prologue, like a rough Colt: he knows not the stop. A good moral my Lord. It is not enough to speak, but to speak true.

---

## HIPPOLYTA:
Indeed he hath plaid on his Prologue, like a child on a Recorder, a sound, but not in government.

---

## THESEUS:
His speech was like a tangled chain: nothing impaired, but all disordered. Who is next?

---

## QUINCE:
Gentles, [HARMONICA SLIDE]
perchance you wonder at this show,
But wonder on, till truth make all things plain.
This man is Piramus, if you would know;
This beauteous Lady, Thisby is certain.
This man, with lime and rough-cast, doth present
Wall, that vile wall, which did these lovers sunder:
And through walls crack (poor souls) they are content
To whisper. At the which, let no man wonder.
This man, with Lanthorne, dog, and bush of thorn,
Presenteth moonshine. For if you will know,
By moonshine did these Lovers think no scorn
To meet at Ninus tomb, there, there to woo:
This grizzly beast (which Lion hight by name)
The trusty Thisby, coming first by night,
Did scare away, or rather did affright:
And as she fled, her mantle she did fall;
Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain.
Anon comes Piramus, sweet youth and tall,
And finds his Thisby’s Mantle slain;
Whereat, with blade, with bloody blameful blade,
He bravely broacht his boiling bloody breast,
And Thisby, tarrying in Mulberry shade,
His dagger drew, and died. For all the rest,
Let Lion, moonshine, Wall, and Lovers twain,
At large discourse, while here they do remain.

---

## THESEUS:
I wonder if the Lion be to speak.

---

## DEMETRIUS:
No wonder, my Lord: one Lion may, when many Asses do.

---

## SNOUT:
In this same Interlude, it doth befall,
That I, one Snout (by name) present a wall:
And such a wall, as I would have you know,
That had in it a crannied little hole:
Through which the Lovers, Piramus and Thisby 
Did whisper often, very secretly.
This loam, this rough-cast, and this stone doth shew,
That I am that same Wall; the truth is so.
And this the cranny is, right and sinister,
Through which the fearful Lovers are to whisper.
[WHISPERS] We forgot!

---

## THESEUS:
Would you desire Lime and Hair to speak better?

---

## DEMETRIUS:
It is the wittiest partition, that ever I heard discourse, my Lord.

---

## THESEUS:
Pyramus draws near the Wall, silence.

---

## BOTTOM:
O grim lookt night, O night with hue so black,
O night, which ever art, when day is not:
O night, O night, alack, alack, alack,
I fear my Thisby’s  promise is forgot.
And thou O wall, thou sweet and lovely wall,
That stands between her fathers ground and mine,
Thou wall, O wall, o sweet and lovely wall,
Shew me thy cleft, to blink through with mine eine.
Thanks courteous wall. Jove shield thee well for this.
But what see I? No Thisby do I see.
O wicked wall, through whom I see no bliss,
Curst be thy stones for thus deceiving mee.

---

## THESEUS:
The wall me-thinks being sensible, should curse again.

---

## BOTTOM:
No in truth sir, he should not. Deceiving me,
Is Thisby’s  cue; she is to enter, and I am to spy
Her through the wall. You shall see it will fall.

Pat as I told you; yonder she comes.

---

## FLUTE:
O wall, full often hast thou heard my moans,
For parting my faire Piramus, and me.
My cherry lips have often kist thy stones;
Thy stones with Lime and Hair knit up in thee.

---

## BOTTOM:
I see a voice; now will I to the cleft,
To spy and I can hear my Thisby’s  face. Thisby?

---

## FLUTE:
My Love thou art, my Love I think.

---

## BOTTOM:
Think what thou wilt, I am thy Lovers grace,
And like Limander am I trusty still.

---

## FLUTE:
And like Helen till the Fates me kill.

---

## BOTTOM:
Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true.

---

## FLUTE:
As Shafalus to Procrus, I to you.

---

## BOTTOM:
O kiss me through the hole of this vile wall.

---

## FLUTE:
I kiss the walls hole, not your lips at all.

---

## BOTTOM:
Wilt thou at Ninnies tomb meet me straight way?

---

## FLUTE:
Tide life, tide death, I come without delay.

---

## SNOUT:
Thus have I Wall, my part discharged so;
And being done, thus Wall away doth go.
This is stupid.

---

## THESEUS:
Now is the moral down between the two Neighbors.

---

## HIPPOLYTA:
This is the silliest stuff that ere I heard.

---

## THESEUS:
The best in this kind are but shadows, and the worst are no worse, if imagination amend them. Here come two noble beasts, in a man and a Lion.

---

## SNUG:
You Ladies, you (whose gentle hearts do fear
The smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor)
May now perchance, both quake and tremble here,
When Lion rough in wildest rage doth roar.
Then know that I, one Snug the Joiner am
A Lion fell, nor else no Lions dam:
For if I should as Lion come in strife
Into this place, 'twere pity of my life.

---

## THESEUS:
A very gentle beast, and of good conscience.
Let us hearken to the moon.

---

## STARVELING:
This Lanthorne doth the horned moon pre- sent.

---

## DEMETRIUS:
He should have worn the horns on his head.


---

## HELENA:
He is no crescent, and his horns are invisible, within the circumference.

---

## STARVELING:
This lanthorne doth the horned moon present: My self, the man i'th moon doth seem to be.

---

## LYSANDER:
This is the greatest error of all the rest; the man
Should be put into the Lanthorne. How is it else the man
i'th moon?

---

## HERMIA:
He dares not come there for the candle.
For you see, it is already in snuff.

---

## HIPPOLYTA:
I am weary of this moon; would he would change.

---

## THESEUS:
It appears by his small light of discretion, that he is in the wane: but yet in courtesy, in all reason, we must stay the time.

---

## HERMIA:
Proceed moon.

---

## STARVELING:
All that I have to say, is to tell you, that the Lanthorne is the moon; I, the man in the moon; this thorn bush, my thorn bush; and this dog, my dog.

---

## DEMETRIUS:
Why all these should be in the Lanthorne: for they are in the moon. But silence, here comes Thisby.

---

## FLUTE:
This is old Ninnies tomb: where is my love?

---

## SNUG:
Oh.


---


[ROARS LOUDLY AS METAL SHEET CRASHES]

---

## DEMETRIUS:
Well roar'd Lion.

---

## THESEUS:
 Well run Thisby.

---

## HIPPOLYTA:
Well shone moon.
Truly the moon shines with a good grace.

---

## HELENA:
Well mouz'd Lion.

---

## DEMETRIUS:
And then came Piramus.

---

## LYSANDER:
And so the Lion vanished.

---

## BOTTOM:
Sweet moon, I thank thee for thy sunny beams,
I thank thee Moon, for shining now so bright:
For by thy gracious, golden, glittering beams,
I trust to taste of truest Thisbys sight.
But stay: O spite! but mark, poor Knight,
What dreadful dole is here?
Eyes do you see! How can it be!
O dainty Ducke: O Dear!
Thy mantle good; what stained with blood!
Approach you Furies fell:
O Fates! come, come: Cut thread and thrum,
Quaile, crush, conclude, and quell.

---

## THESEUS:
This passion, and the death of a dear friend,
Would go near to make a man look sad.

---

## HIPPOLYTA:
Beshrew my heart, but I pity the man.

---

## BOTTOM:
O wherefore Nature, did'st thou Lion’s frame?
Since Lion vilde hath here deflour'd my deere:
Which is: no, no, which was the fairest Dame
That lived, that loved, that liked, that looked with cheer.
Come tears, confound: Out sword, and wound
The pap of Piramus:
Aye, that left pap, where heart doth hop;
Thus die I, thus, thus, thus.
Now am I dead, now am I fled, my soul is in the sky,
Tongue lose thy light, moon take thy flight,
Now die, AGH, die, AGH, die, AGH,  die, AGH, die. Glug, glug, glug…

---

## THESEUS:
With the help of a Surgeon, he might yet recover, and prove an Ass.

---

## HIPPOLYTA:
How chance moonshine is gone before?
Thisby comes back, and finds her Lover.

---

## THESEUS:
She will find him by star-light.
Here she comes, and her passion ends the play.

---

## HIPPOLYTA:
Me thinks she should not use a long one for
such a Piramus: I hope she will be brief.

---

## FLUTE:
Asleep my Love? What, dead my Dove?
O Piramus arise:
Speake, Speake. Quite dumb? Dead, dead? A tomb
Must cover thy sweet eyes.
These Lily Lips, this cherry nose,
These yellow Cowslip cheeks
Are gone, are gone: Lovers make moan:
His eyes were green as Leeks.
O sisters three, come, come to mee,
With hands as pale as Milk,
Lay them in gore, since you have shore
With sheers, his thread of silk.
Tongue not a word: Come trusty sword:
Come blade, my breast imbrue:
And farewell friends, thus Thisby ends;
Adieu, [screams] adieu, adieu.

---

## THESEUS:
 Moonshine & Lion are left to bury the dead.

---

## DEMETRIUS:
Aye, and Wall too.

---

## BOTTOM:
No, I assure you, the wall is down, that parted their Fathers. Will it please you to see the Epilogue, or to hear a Bergomask dance, between two of our company?

---

## THESEUS:
No Epilogue, I pray you; for your play needs no excuse. Never excuse; for when the players are all dead, there need none to be blamed. Marry, if he that writ it had plaid Piramus, and hung himself in Thisby’s garter, it would have been a fine Tragedy: and so it is truly, and very notably discharged. But come, your Burgomaske; let your Epilogue alone.

---

## QUINCE:
5, 6, 7, 8!

[HARMONICA AND METAL SHEET PERCUSSION]

---

## THESEUS:
The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve.
Lovers to bed, 'tis almost Fairy time.
I fear we shall out-sleep the coming morn,
As much as we this night have Over -watched.
This palpable gross play hath well beguil'd
The heavy gate of night. Sweet friends to bed.


---


[LOW RUMBLING]

---

## PUCK:
If we shadows have offended,
Think but this, and all is mended:
That you have but slumbered here,
While these visions did appear.
And this weak and idle theme,
No more yielding but a dream.
Gentles, do not reprehend.
If you pardon, we will mend.
And, as I am an honest Puck,
If we have unearnèd luck
Now to 'scape the serpent's tongue,
We will make amends ere long.
Else the Puck a liar call.
So, good night unto you all.
Give me your hands, if we be friends,
And Robin shall restore amends.
