[Ambient city noise, jazz music]

[doorbell rings]

---

## FRAN:

Hey.

## OWEN:

Hey. 

---

## OWEN:
So what do we have here?

---

## FRAN:

Laundry?

---

## OWEN:

Funny. You’re funny. Just under eight. I have to charge you for nine pounds though. That’s the minimum.

---

## FRAN:

I know.

---

## OWEN:

You got eight there.

---

## FRAN:

I get it. It’s okay.

---

## OWEN:

Last four digits.

## FRAN:

What?

---

## OWEN:

Last four digits of your phone number.

---

## FRAN:

Oh. 3210

## OWEN:

Blastoff. Ha.

---

## FRAN:

What?

---

## OWEN:

You know... Three, two, one, zero, blastoff.

---

## FRAN:

Oh right. Where’s Yolanda?

---

## OWEN:

I’m making you miss her, huh?

## FRAN:

A little bit.

---

## OWEN:

She quit. When do you need this?

---

## FRAN:

Tomorrow.

## OWEN:

Fine. After two.

---

## FRAN:

I need it in the morning. I’m leaving town at ten.

---

## OWEN:

Okay. It’ll be ready by nine.

---

## FRAN:

Why’d Yolanda quit?

## OWEN:

She won the lottery.

---

## FRAN:

You’re kidding. How much did she win?

---

## OWEN:

Two hundred dollars. 

---

She overreacted. She’ll be back tomorrow.

---

## FRAN:

Oh. I should have a credit there.

## OWEN:

For what?

---

## FRAN:

You guys lost my laundry six months ago.

---

## OWEN:

Oh that was you! Fran... Don’t tell me. Fran Costello.

---

## FRAN:

Pretty good.

---

## OWEN:

I’m cheating. It pops up with the phone number. 

---

It’s very rare that we lose a bag. How much was the credit?

---

## FRAN:

A hundred and fifty dollars.

---

## OWEN:

Oh here it is. I see it. Okay.

---

## FRAN:

It cost me a lot more than a hundred and fifty to replace that stuff, I can tell you.

---

## OWEN:

Sorry.

## FRAN:

It’s not your fault.

---

## OWEN:

In a way it is. I’m the owner.

## FRAN:

Oh.

---

## OWEN:

Owen.

## FRAN:

What?

---

## OWEN:

My name’s Owen.

---

## FRAN:

Alright.

---

## OWEN:

Okay. As of this, your credit’s down to fifty eight dollars.

---

## FRAN:

I’m so used to not paying, it’s going to be hard to go back.

---

## OWEN:

I hear you. What do you do for a living?

---

## FRAN:

Office bullshit.

## OWEN:

I did that. I never miss it.

---

## FRAN:

Is this really better? It must be hot in the summer.

---

## OWEN:

I don’t stay here all day. I’m just holding down the fort. I got three places.

---

## FRAN:

Wow. Good for you.

---

## OWEN:

I thank God every morning.

---

## FRAN:

You believe in God?

---

## OWEN:

Yeah, why not? You want your dry cleaning?

---

## FRAN:

Oh aaa...

## OWEN:

Come on. What are you doing? It’s been here a long time.

---

## FRAN:

I know. Yeah okay, I’ll take it.

---

## OWEN:

Good. But bear with me. This may take a minute.

---

## FRAN:

Knock yourself out. I’m sitting down. 

---

You don’t really believe in God, do you?

---

## OWEN:

The hell I don’t. I used to work at a grimy corporate nine to five with a crappy paycheck, and I couldn’t get a month ahead to save my life.

---

Then one morning, I’m so eaten up in my mind with, you know, bullshit, that I walk right in front of a car. Bang. 

---

Wake up in traction, and there’s a guy standing at the foot of my bed, smiling at me like I don’t know what, an undertaker. You know who he was?

---

## FRAN:

No idea.

---

## OWEN:

He was a lawyer. The schmuck who hit me ran a light. Next thing you know, this lawyer gets me a very nice settlement from the insurance company.

---

[Owen rings the desk bell]
We’re looking for a jacket, right?

---

## FRAN:

Yeah. A green jacket.

---

## OWEN:

A green jacket. Then, cause I’m out of work so long, my job lets me go. 

---

So I take this same lawyer, and I sue my boss for wrongful termination. And I win a second settlement.
[Rings the desk bell again]

---

Now I’m sitting on more cash than I’ve ever seen, and it comes to me that this is the answer to my prayers, my ticket to change my life. 

---

So I bought a drop off laundry in Queens, and lived in my car for a year, saving every dime. Then I borrowed money and bought another laundry. 

---

Now I have three. I’ll tell you here and now. I’ll never work for anybody again. You ask me if believe in God? Why wouldn’t I? I hit the jackpot.

---

## FRAN:

You lucked out.

---

## OWEN:

In a way. Here we go. One green jacket.

---

## FRAN:

Why doesn’t anything like that happen to me?


## OWEN:

Like what?

---

## FRAN:

The lawsuit, the money.

---

## OWEN:

Be careful. You wanna get hit by a car?

---

## FRAN:

At this point, it doesn’t sound so bad.

---

## OWEN:

Whoa. Come on. Don’t say that. You never know who’s listening. You look like you’re doing fine.

---

## FRAN:

It all depends what you mean by fine.

---

## OWEN:

Look, I’m leaving a lot of stuff out. My back’s never been right since, but I think it’s important to emphasize the good over the bad. Mentally.

---

## FRAN:

You’re probably right.

---

## OWEN:

AND. To recognize when your chance comes along.

---

## FRAN:

What if there is no chance that comes along?

---

## OWEN:

You’re like my fiancé was.

---

## FRAN:

She’s...?

## OWEN:

Gone. 

---

She was like you. Smart, one inch from terrific, but gloomy.


---

## FRAN:

I don’t think I’m gloomy. I think what I’m suffering from is reality.

---

## OWEN:

Some folks look life in the mouth.

---

## FRAN:

You’re not one of those people who think I’m manifesting, are you?

## OWEN:

What? No.

---

## FRAN:

I got a friend at work always telling me that I’m manifesting.


## OWEN:

What’s that mean?

---

## FRAN:

It’s like if it rains, I made it rain. It’s my fault it rained.

## OWEN:

I’m not saying that.

---

## FRAN:

You said I was gloomy.

---

## OWEN:

Look, I take it back.

---

## FRAN:

Anyway, tomorrow.

## OWEN:

I won’t be here.

---

## FRAN:

Okay so... Never.


---

## OWEN:

Wow, you’re like...a little brutal.

---

## FRAN:

What do you know about it?

## OWEN:

Probably nothing.

---

## FRAN:

Mister Sunshine. Look, I’m sorry. I’m not having a good day.

## OWEN:

No, I’m sorry.

---

## FRAN:

I couldn’t sleep. And I didn’t like that comment about the eight pounds of laundry.

---

## OWEN:

What was wrong with that? I was just saying the minimum’s nine.

---

## FRAN:

I used to come in with thirteen, fourteen pounds, but now I live alone, okay? And I don’t need my nose rubbed in it.

---

## OWEN:

Oh okay.

---

## FRAN:

It took me two weeks to get the bag that full.

---

## OWEN:

You know what? It’s none of my business.

---

## FRAN:

You got that right.


---

## OWEN:

Look. I don’t want to bicker with you.

---

## FRAN:

Then don’t.

---

## OWEN:

I know what it’s like when you don’t sleep.

---

## FRAN:

And don’t be like accommodating. That just obnoxious. 

---

God. Listen to me. Now I’m embarrassed.

---

## OWEN:

What for?

---

## FRAN:

You embarrassed me.

## OWEN:

Me?

---

## FRAN:

Has to be you. I feel ridiculous and I didn’t when I walked in.

---

## OWEN:

I didn’t do anything.

---

## FRAN:

Okay. Look. It’s not you exactly. It’s just... You know what it is? I hate the smell of soap and this place stinks of soap.

---

## OWEN:

Well, it’s a laundry.

---

## FRAN:

What kind of soap is that?

---

## OWEN:

Only the best. Arm and Hammer.

---

## FRAN:

Arm and Hammer, huh? It reminds me of my mother.

---

## OWEN:

You didn’t get along?

---

## FRAN:

No, we got along.

---

## OWEN:

You alright?

---

## FRAN:

Fine.

---

## OWEN:

I hate it when I can’t sleep. You want a lollipop?

---

## FRAN:

Very funny. I don’t need you to talk down to me.

---

## OWEN:

I’m just kidding on you a little. Look. You’ll feel better tomorrow.

---

## FRAN:

No, I won’t. I get dressed for work. I work to pay bills. I pay bills to run outta money. And then I start again. 

---

I don’t get it. I come down here with my little bag of rags. And it’s my fault.

---

## OWEN:

What?

---

## FRAN:

The whole thing. My life. My crappy job. I don’t know how, but I did this. I made things this way. Pointless.

---

## OWEN:

Listen. You can’t think that way.

---

## FRAN:

Who says?

---

## OWEN:

You have to train your mind away from depression.

---

## FRAN:

Who said anything about depression?

---

## OWEN:

I think you might be a little depressed.

---

## FRAN:

Oh, so you’re a doctor now? Who asked you?

---

## OWEN:

Wow, you’re halfway to hostile.

---

## FRAN:

Yeah well so what?

---

## OWEN:

Let’s just be quiet for a minute.

---

## FRAN:

Are you telling me to be quiet?!

---

## OWEN:

No. I’m making a space. Between us. For peace to break out.

---

## FRAN:

Never mind. How much for the dry cleaning?

---

## OWEN:

Seven fifty. I’ll put it against your tab. You want to have dinner?

---

## FRAN:

What?

---

## OWEN:

You wanna get dinner?

---

## FRAN:

No.

---

## OWEN:

I don’t know. I felt a pinch.

---

## FRAN:

A pinch? When? What do you mean?

---

## OWEN:

I don’t know. Like you pinched me.

---

## FRAN:

Well, I didn’t.

---

## OWEN:

I’m not saying you did.

---

## FRAN:

A pinch.

---

## OWEN:

Yeah.

---

## FRAN:

So. Hey, this was on the floor.

---

## OWEN:

What’s that?

---

## FRAN:

A quarter. It was on the floor.

## OWEN:

So keep it. Finders keepers.

---

## FRAN:

Please, I don’t want your quarter.

---

## OWEN:

It’s not mine. Somebody musta dropped it.

## FRAN:

Well, I don’t want it cause it’s not mine.

---

## OWEN:

What? You afraid of a little change?

---

## FRAN:

Owen, right?

---

## OWEN:

Yeah.

---

## FRAN:

Are you crazy?

---

## OWEN:

No.

---

## FRAN:

Why would you want to have dinner with a person who’s in the middle of an episode?

---

## OWEN:

I don’t know. Everybody has a bad day.

---

## FRAN:

You got that right. I’m not always like this.

## OWEN:

I know.

---

## FRAN:

What are you talking about? You can’t know. You don’t know me.

---

## OWEN:

You’re a lot like my fiancé was.

---

## FRAN:

Gloomy?

---

## OWEN:

Gloomy as shit. But one inch from terrific.

---

## FRAN:

And gone.

---

## OWEN:

Yeah, she’s gone like yesterday.

---

## FRAN:

She left yesterday?

---

## OWEN:

No, it’s an expression. She’s been gone the better part of two years.

---

## FRAN:

And I remind you of her?

---

## OWEN:

Yeah.

---

## FRAN:

That’s just rebound stuff.

---

## OWEN:

You’re probably right.

---

## FRAN:

I don’t want to be right. Okay. I’m going away for a week. So after that, if you still want, we could have dinner.

---

## OWEN:

Good.

---

## FRAN:

But I don’t get why you want to really. I’m not your old gloomy girlfriend. I’m somebody else.

---

## OWEN:

Well, who ever you think I am, I’m somebody else, too.

---

## FRAN:

Okay. Do I need a ticket for the laundry?

---

## OWEN:

No. Just the last four digits of your phone number. 3210

## FRAN:

Blastoff.

---

## OWEN:

Yeah. Have a nice trip.

---

## FRAN:

Thanks. I’m swipin’ one.

---

[Jazz Music]

[*Old Town Road* by Lil Nas X plays on the radio. Dogs barking and children yelling]

---


## WOMAN'S VOICE OFFSTAGE:
You sure you'll be okay?
 

---

## FRAN:
Yeah, I'll be fine. Go, enjoy yourselves. Go, go, go!


---

[Music Stops]

---

## FRAN:

Trish? Trish? Can you hear me? I used to watch you sleep like this when I was a kid. 

---

My beautiful sister. Even now. Beautiful. Forty eight years old. 

---

Jesus Christ! How did you end up here? For Roger, that bum? For Roger freakin’ Toomey?! You gotta be kidding me.

---

## TRISH:

Oh my god.

## FRAN:

Did I scare you? I’m sorry.

---

## TRISH:

Was I asleep?

## FRAN:

Yeah.

---

## TRISH:

I thought you were the radio.

## FRAN:

I turned it off.

---

## TRISH:

Help me up. Get me that thing with the arms.

---

## TRISH:

Get this thing off my face please. Good.

---

## FRAN:

Hey. I brought you something.

---

## TRISH:

A present?

---

## FRAN:

No.

## TRISH:

What?

---

## FRAN:

Wait a minute. Where’d it go?

---

## TRISH:

You’re asking me? I don’t know. I don’t even know what you’re talking about.

---

## FRAN:
 
Here we go. Here.

Tada!

---

## TRISH:

What’s that?

---

## FRAN:

The green jacket you lent me.

---

## TRISH:

What green jacket?

---

## FRAN:

When Tyler was born. It was raining, so you lent me your jacket.

---

## TRISH:

Tyler?

## FRAN:
Susie's kid.

---

## TRISH:

I lent you..

---

## FRAN:

I kept forgetting to return it, but I wanted to get it cleaned first so...

---

## TRISH:

I lent you a jacket when Tyler was born?

---

## FRAN:

After the christening. Yeah.

---

## TRISH:

Wasn’t that like six years ago?

---

## FRAN:

Yes. I wanted to get it cleaned first.

---

## TRISH:

Oh Franny. They only made one of you.

---

## FRAN:

I’m sorry it took me so long.

---

## TRISH:

Six years?

## FRAN:

I know.

---

## TRISH:

It doesn’t matter.

## FRAN:

It would’ve bothered me.

---

## TRISH:

Forget it. Let me ask you. Did you ever experiment with drugs?

---

## FRAN:

What? No.

---

## TRISH:

You should.

---

## FRAN:

No, I shouldn’t.

---

## TRISH:

I’m telling you. I wish I’d done more of them. But with Roger around, it wasn’t a good idea.

## FRAN:

That’s for sure.

---

## TRISH:

These pills I’m on make you dream crazy stuff. Get this. I dreamt I was a big mountain goat.

---

## FRAN:

What?

---

## TRISH:

Yeah. I was a big mountain goat. King of the mountain goats. And I was jumping from one thing to another. Who wouldn’t want to have that experience?

---

## FRAN:

Of being a goat?

## TRISH:

I was a king. It was a great dream.

---

Dry mouth. Water.

---

## TRISH:
Thanks.

## FRAN:

Take your time.

---

## TRISH:

And I keep thinking about this scarf I had.

## FRAN:

What scarf?

---

## TRISH:

I had a scarf once, and it had a picture on it of a man looking into a lake. Very wise face. Chinese guy.

---

He was looking at a catfish and I could tell he was... he was...thinking about philosophy. 

---

You know what I mean? What it all meant. Life. You know?

## FRAN:

Yeah.

---

## TRISH:

And this was on a scarf I bought at a flea market for like seventy five cents. This man looking at this fish. Why would somebody put that on a scarf?

---

## FRAN:

I don’t know.

---

## TRISH:

Am I drooling?

## FRAN:

Yeah.

---

## TRISH:

Oh, and I dreamt I was in the jungle. And there were playing cards and jungle birds. And Ma was there. And you. And we were playing Hearts.

---

## FRAN:

Hearts? Oh, Jesus.

---

## TRISH:

I know. Well, dream or no, if Ma was there, we were going to be playing Hearts, right?

---

## FRAN:

That’s for sure.

---

## TRISH:

How many games of Hearts do you think we played all in?

---

## FRAN:

When I was a kid? I don’t know. A lot.

---

## TRISH:

Everybody’s got a favorite game, right? What’s yours?

---

## FRAN:

I don’t like games. They make me nervous.

---

## TRISH:

That’s right. You don’t. But we made you play Hearts.

---

## FRAN:

Yes, you did. All the time.

---

## TRISH:

Ma just always thought it was a good idea to play. Did I hear you talking when I was out of it?

---

## FRAN:

Yeah, I was... Yeah.

---

## TRISH:

Who were you talking to? Hospice?

## FRAN:

Myself.

---

## TRISH:

That’s the best company, right?

## FRAN:

Sure.

---

## TRISH:

Is hospice here?

---

## FRAN:

She took the kids out for ice cream.

---

## TRISH:

She shouldn’t be laying out for that.

---

## FRAN:

I got it.

## TRISH:

Thanks.

---

## FRAN:

I wanted some time alone with you.

## TRISH:

Yeah.

---

## FRAN:

How you feeling?

---

## TRISH:

What’s it matter?

---

## FRAN:

Are you hungry?

---

## TRISH:

No. Did you meet the hospice woman?

---

## FRAN:

Yeah, I a...

---

## TRISH:

Right. You said. You sent her out with the kids.

## FRAN:

Yeah.

---

## TRISH:

She’s great.

## FRAN:

A little spooky.

---

## TRISH:

Wouldn’t you be?

---

## FRAN:

I could never do that job. She looks at you with that look, you know, the look people get when they stare at the ocean.

---

## TRISH:

Did they take the dogs?

## FRAN:

Yeah. Thank God.

---

## TRISH:

They keep the place jumpin’. Where’s Susie?

---

## FRAN:

She couldn’t come. Tyler’s sick. She’s so protective of that kid.

---

## TRISH:

Well, he’s a little checked out. I think he’s on the spectrum.

---

## FRAN:

Who isn’t? Next time I’ll make her come.

---

## TRISH:

Next time. How is she?

---

## FRAN:

You know. Practical. She lives by that appointment app. It drives me nuts.

---

## TRISH:

Yeah, that’s her. How’s her marriage?

---

## FRAN:

Fine I guess.

---

## TRISH:

I don’t know. That Gus is a stiff. Roger Dodger’s no walk in the park, but at least he’s kinda fun.

---

## FRAN:

Have you heard from him?

---

## TRISH:

We talked. We had the talk.

---

## FRAN:

What do you mean?

---

## TRISH:

The kids. He’s gonna step up.

## FRAN:

When?

---

## TRISH:

When I’m gone, Fran.

---

## FRAN:

Don’t talk like that. I mean, I’m looking at you. You don’t even look that bad.

---

## TRISH:

Doesn’t matter how I look.

---

## FRAN:

Your eyes are clear.

---

## TRISH:

I’m already blind in one.

---

## FRAN:

You still have your hair. What do they know?

---

## TRISH:

They know more than us, baby.

---

## FRAN:

Don’t give up.

---

## TRISH:

Okay. It’s halfway through my brain. I’m lucky I can talk. I slur sometimes. I try not to do that in front of the kids. They’ll think I’m drunk. They need me to be upbeat.

---

## FRAN:

You haven’t told them?

---

## TRISH:

Not really.

---

## FRAN:

Shouldn’t they be told?

---

## TRISH:

What’s the difference? They don’t want to hear it and I don’t want to tell ‘em. They’re so young.

---

## FRAN:

And Roger’s going to step up?

---

## TRISH:

He really means it.

## FRAN:

He always does.

---

## TRISH:

He’s not that bad.

---

## FRAN:

Where is he?

---

## TRISH:

He’s doing good. He’s got a big job down in Florida. Construction. Tons of overtime. And he’s back in the program.

---

## FRAN:

Well, that’s good.

---

## TRISH:

Yeah. Forty something days now.

---

## FRAN:

Good start. He should be here.

---

## TRISH:

Yeah. I heard what you said when you thought I was asleep.

---

## FRAN:

Oh God. What did I say? I was rambling.

---

## TRISH:

You were trashing Roger. Why would I marry a bum like that? I heard you.

---

## FRAN:

Shit, I’m sorry.

---

## TRISH:

And you called me beautiful. I already knew your point of view about Roger boy. But give me credit, you know? I did divorce him. Twice.

---

## FRAN:

Who am I to even have an opinion?

---

## TRISH:

I’ll tell you why I married him.

---

## FRAN:

You don’t have to.

## TRISH:

He asked.

---

## FRAN:

Yeah. Okay.

---

## TRISH:

I wanted to get to it, you know? Out on my own. I knew it was gonna be me or Susie that got stuck with Mom in the walker, and I’m no nurse. 

---

You were still a kid. And right about then, old Roger showed up.

---

## FRAN:

There would have been other guys.

---

## TRISH:

I don’t know. I was only gonna get older and uglier. I wanted a family. And after a couple of false starts, I got one.

---

## FRAN:

Right.

---

## TRISH:

If I’d waited, who knows?

## FRAN:

Yeah, look at me.

---

## TRISH:

Assholes and oranges.

---

## FRAN:

Assholes and oranges?

---

## TRISH:

Apples! I mean apples! You and me. Different people. I’m a... I’m kinda off the cuff. Susie’s the responsible one. And you’re... 

---

The truth is, I don’t know you that well. You’re the mystery sister.

---

## FRAN:

What do you mean? I think I’m very available.

## TRISH:

For what?

---

You suffer over things, Fran, and I don’t know what those things are. Like with the jacket. What the hell do I need with a jacket now?

---

## FRAN:

I know. I just always meant to return it. And now it’s late.

## TRISH:

I remember when you were little, in the Fall, you used to cry that the leaves fell from the trees.

---

## FRAN:

Let’s just talk about you.

---

## TRISH:

Remember how you’d freeze up in the card game cause you couldn’t make up your mind, 

---

and Ma would start talking about her cards to pass the time, and Susie would go off the rails? 

---

‘No talking, Ma.’ You can’t talk about your cards. It’s against the rules.’ Jeez. Everybody did exactly what you’d expect them to do. Every time. 

---

You’d clam up, Ma would start talking about her cards, and Susie would lay down the law. ‘No talking.’. It was so great. 

---

It was just a card table, you know, and a deck of Talley Ho, but when I think about things, it was maybe the happiest time in my life.

---

## FRAN:

Yes. I hate this.

---

## TRISH:

What?

---

## FRAN:

What’s happening to you.

---

## TRISH:

It’s just life, right?

---

## FRAN:

I wish we’d been closer.

---

## TRISH:

Me too, But it’s alright. No matter how long you get, you want more. You look back and you see the mistakes. 

---

I’ve laid here and cursed myself a hundred times over trivial shit. What’s the point? I’m not going to be in the history books. 

---

I’m just a woman who married a drug addict, had two kids, and died on the young side. Can you do me a favor?

---

## FRAN:

Sure.

---

## TRISH:

In the thing there, there’s some flowers.

---

## FRAN:

This?

---

## TRISH:

Yeah.

---

## FRAN:

They’re fake.

---

## TRISH:

No, they’re artificial. There’s a wire clippers there. Could you cut the wires near the bottom so the flowers are loose?

---

## FRAN:

Okay?

---

## TRISH:

They were in a vase I didn’t like.

---

## FRAN:

How long have you had these?

---

## TRISH:

Can you believe it? Twenty something years. You can wash them. They never fade. But I didn’t like the vase. 

---

I always meant to put them in something else. The problem was the whole thing, the vase and the flowers, turned out to be in one piece.

---

So last week, I broke the flowers out of the vase with a hammer. Only then I find out that the stems are welded together, too. 

---

I got another pot they’d look nice in, but I can’t get them into it with that thing on the bottom. And now I’m so weak.

---

## FRAN:

Look, I could go out and buy you flowers.

---

## TRISH:

My head is killing me. NO, I WANT THESE! I’ve had these a long time. I always meant to do this. I just didn’t like the vase.

---

## TRISH:

Water.

---

## FRAN:

How many of those are you taking?

---

## TRISH:

Four.

---

## FRAN:

Are you supposed to take so many?

---

## TRISH:

I’m not supposed to take any. This is my secret stash.

---

## FRAN:

They are kind of pretty.

---

## TRISH:

Yeah. I like them.

---

## FRAN:

Right.

---

## TRISH:

Seeing anybody?

## FRAN:

No.

---

## TRISH:

Come on. I need some gossip.

---

## FRAN:

Well, I am having dinner with a guy when I get back.

---

## TRISH:

Nice guy?

## FRAN:

Maybe.

---

## TRISH:

Don’t tell him about me right off.

---

## FRAN:

Why not?

---

## TRISH:

Who needs a sob story up front? Get him on board first. He’s gotta be better than Roger, right? 

---

Don’t drag your feet, Fran. Don’t be too picky. It’s over in a minute.

---

## FRAN:

What, are you trying to give me a panic attack?

---

## TRISH:

You should listen to me.

## FRAN:

I’m listening.

---

## TRISH:

Listen harder. Do what you have to do. Make your move.

## FRAN:

Okay.

---

## TRISH:

You hearing me?

## FRAN:

Loud and clear.

---

## TRISH:

LIVE!

---

## FRAN:

Okay, I’ll live.

## TRISH:

Promise?

---

## FRAN:

Promise. Where’s the thing you want to put these flowers in?

---

## TRISH:

Living room. By the tv.

---

## FRAN:

Okay.

---

---

## TRISH:

Are you seeing anybody? Sorry. I already asked you that. You are, right? You said you are. Good for you.

---

## FRAN:

You say something? Is this it?

---

## TRISH:

Yeah.

## FRAN:

It’s cute.

---

## TRISH:

Let me have it, please. And the flowers.

---

## FRAN:

I’ll hand them to you.

---

## TRISH:

When I’m gone, maybe you can reach out to Roger a bit.

---

## FRAN:

Sure.

---

## TRISH:

He’s not a bad person.

## FRAN:

Okay.

---

## TRISH:

There’s love in there. He’s just the way he is. He can’t sit still.

## FRAN:

Right.

---

## TRISH:

I wish I could have relaxed him, taken the ants out of his pants. I thought I could for a while. 

---

But then you wake up to, you know, the limitations of people. And it’s okay. Let it be, you know? Ma had that attitude, you know?

---

## FRAN:

Yeah.

---

## TRISH:

Childhood’s the best time maybe. I loved being a kid. Before Mom got sick.

---

## FRAN:

Before my time.

---

## TRISH:

And the funny thing is, I couldn’t wait for it to be over. I wanted to be out of there and on my own. Where did I think I was going? 

---

Life is ridiculous. You can’t talk about it because you always get it wrong. No talking, right? 

---

I’ll tell you one thing. I didn’t think I’d end up on cinderblocks, in a ratty trailer in Pennsylvania. 

---

The pills are kick-in in. Oh yeah. And I wish you and me had gotten drunk together at least once. Spilled our guts. The whole melodrama, right?

---

## FRAN:

Yeah, that would’ve been nice. 

---

## TRISH:

We have to do it now, whatever it is. Nothing I say needs to be said. I was like Roger. On the run. Bonnie and Clyde, huh? 

---

But we never robbed a bank. We never really did anything, him and me. What did we do? If you looked us up, we’re not even in the book. 

---

There. Put it back by the tv if you don’t mind. It’ll look nice there for the kids. They’ll know their Momma’s around. Even when she isn’t.

---

## FRAN:

It does look nice.

---

## TRISH:

Take this rose.

## FRAN:

What for?

---

## TRISH:

For you.

## FRAN:

Okay.

---

## TRISH:

They’re that age, my kids, when everything’s important. Yeah. All their lives they’ll remember stuff from now. Meaningless things, you know? 

---

The pattern on a spoon. A bird washing itself in a puddle. The sun. It burns into you at that age. It burns. We played a hundred games of Hearts. 

---

The record player’d be going. The washing machine would be going. Then Ma would start talking about her cards. And Susie would say ‘No talking!’ And all we did was talk. 

---

It blows my mind. You go to a restaurant, everybody’s talking. And I think ‘About what?’ What are they talking about? What could they be talking about? What’s the topic? 

---

Sometimes you see hundreds of people, in an airport, in a mall, yakking away. About what for Chrissake? 

---

What are they even talking about? It doesn’t matter. It’s not the point. It’s like the point is that it doesn’t matter. 

---

The point is... It’s like the birds in the morning. They always sing the same thing. But what would the morning be without them? 

---

The people in the restaurant die, and other people come and pick up the conversation like they were always there, and they’ll always be there. 

---

Don’t they know they’re already ghosts? Imagine how many people are standing behind you, watching you take your turn. Right now. You gotta know Ma’s back there looking. 

---

It’s like a childhood, this life, and then you realize that childhood is all there is maybe. We talk about growing up, but who grows up? 

---

There’s no time. Being a kid is everything. “Don’t talk about your cards!’ And all we did was talk.

---

---

## FRAN:

Trish? You asleep?

---

## TRISH:

She’s here, isn’t she? 

---

Mom. Yeah, she’s here. Remember everything. 

---

Oxygen.

---

---

Radio.

---

[*Radio* by Lana del Rey Plays]

---

[Ambient restaurant noise, Jazz music]

---

[Music fades, applause]

---

## FRAN:

Here I am. I’m sorry I’m late.

---

## OWEN:

You’re not really that late.

## FRAN:

What’s that smell?

---

## OWEN:

They’re grilling. That’s how they do it here. When you’re ready, you just go up, pick what you want, and they grill it. Fish. Vegetables. Meat. Whatever you like.

---

## FRAN:

It’s so nostalgic.

---

## OWEN:

What?

---

## FRAN:

I’m stoned.

## OWEN:

Oh.

---

## FRAN:

I took mushrooms.

## OWEN:

Is that something you do?

---

## FRAN:

No, it’s my first time. Have you ever taken them?

## OWEN:

No.

---

## FRAN:

I guess I wanted to change the way I see things a little bit

## OWEN:

Did it work?

---

## FRAN:

I don’t know. Those lights look good. Really good.

---

## OWEN:

Okay.

---

## FRAN:

It’s a very low dose. I made sure of that. I brought some for you in case you wanted...to join me. It’s chocolate. You like chocolate?

---

## OWEN:

Yeah. How long’s it last?

---

## FRAN:

That was my first question, too. Couple of hours. My friend at work who tells me I’m manifesting, she got it for me.

---

## OWEN:

You’re funny.

## FRAN:

I am?

---

## OWEN:

Yeah. I never would’ve figured you to show up stoned.

---

## FRAN:

I’ve been a little bitter, and I don’t like that. I want to step out of that.

---

## OWEN:

What are you bitter about?

---

## FRAN:

I think I’m just disappointed.

## OWEN:

With what?

---

## FRAN:

If I knew I’d tell you. I guess I feel like the light has never been on me. It’s my fault. I’ve never had the courage. To step into it. That spotlight from the sky. 

---

Somebody here on my left is all lit up. Somebody on my right. But me...

---

## OWEN:

You’re in the gloomy spot.

---

## FRAN:

Don’t start in with the gloomy again. I can’t take it.

---

## OWEN:

Why not? It’s what you’re saying.

---

## FRAN:

Don’t put words in my mouth. Oh wow.

## OWEN:

What?

---

## FRAN:

I’m picturing that. Like you have a cup of words, and you’re picking them up with a tweezers and putting them in my mouth. Like when they feed a baby platypus or something.

---

## OWEN:

A baby platypus? Damn.

## FRAN:

What?

---

## OWEN:

You’re wrecked. You’re halfway to the moon. Alright, I’ll take it.

---

## FRAN:

Oh wow. You did it. Just like that.

---

## OWEN:

Tasty.

## FRAN:

I didn’t think you’d do it.

---

## OWEN:

Why not? I could use a jolt.

---

## FRAN:

Is this my water?

## OWEN:

Yeah.

---

## FRAN:

I’m looking at you through my water.

## OWEN:

How do I look?

---

## FRAN:

Like the plastic palace in my mother’s goldfish bowl.

---

## OWEN:

Great. How long’s this stuff take to kick in?

## FRAN:

‘Bout twenty minutes.

---

## OWEN:

So you’re twenty minutes ahead of me.

## FRAN:

I do feel different.

---

## OWEN:

You look very pretty.

---

## FRAN:

Thank you.

---

## OWEN:

How was your road trip?

---

## FRAN:

Fine.

---

## OWEN:

Where’d you go?

---

## FRAN:

Pennsylvania. Family thing.

## OWEN:

Wedding?

---

## FRAN:

Yeah. I went for a wedding. So.

---

## OWEN:

I have a surprise.

## FRAN:

What?

---

## OWEN:

It’s gonna blow your mind. I found your laundry.

---

## FRAN:

What do you mean?

---

## OWEN:

Your laundry. The bag we lost six months ago. I found it.

---

## FRAN:

You’re kidding me. This is my laundry?

---

## OWEN:

Amazing, right? I had to do some major detective work. It was in one of my other stores the whole time, in a storage closet. How it got there I have no idea. There it is.

---

## FRAN:

Did you open it?

---

## OWEN:

No. Your name was on the ticket. It’s yours. I didn’t want to nose through your stuff.

---

## FRAN:

Those are my sheets. That’s my blue stripe. Oh my God.

---

## OWEN:

What?

---

## FRAN:

My boyfriend’s pants are in here. Gross. From back when I had a boyfriend.

---

## OWEN:

Do you know where he is? I can return ‘em if you want.

---

## FRAN:

No way he’s getting those pants. He stuck me for the rent. What size are you?

---

## OWEN:

I don’t want your boyfriend’s pants.

---

## FRAN:

I guess you wouldn’t. It’s so strange.

---

## OWEN:

What?

---

## FRAN:

Time. You think a thing is gone, and there it is. It’s in the laundry bag.

---

## OWEN:

Can we have wine with this? I ordered this wine.

---

## FRAN:

Why not? She said it’s really mild.

---

## OWEN:

You want me to serve you?

---

## FRAN:

Yeah, I don’t trust my spacial...aim. 

---

You wanna know something about me?

## OWEN:

Sure.

---

## FRAN:

I have a very strong sense of smell.

---

## OWEN:

Okay. What are you smelling?

---

## FRAN:

For example, I can smell this wine without even picking it up.

## OWEN:

Wow.

---

## FRAN:

And I can smell you.

---

## OWEN:

Uh oh. Do I smell like laundry?

---

## FRAN:

No.

## OWEN:

Good.

---

## FRAN:

You smell like a man.

---

## OWEN:

Is that good or bad?

---

## FRAN:

I like it. Why did your fiancé leave you?

---

## OWEN:

You want to get into that?

## FRAN:

Yeah.

---

## OWEN:

Are you sure?

## FRAN:

Why not?

---

## OWEN:

Okay. We had sexual problems.

---

## FRAN:

Oh Jesus Christ I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have asked.

---

## OWEN:

It was me.

## FRAN:

You.

---

## OWEN:

After the accident, my back was a disaster. I couldn’t perform because of the pain. That was a deal breaker for her. I can understand.

---

## FRAN:

It’s better now?

---

## OWEN:

A little. The truth is I don’t know. Maybe not.

---

## FRAN:

You haven’t? You can’t have sex?

---

## OWEN:

You want me to be totally honest? I’m afraid to try. I’m kind of doing alright now, and I’m scared to tamper with that. 

---

I guess I’ll have to, right? I want to. I don’t know. My doctor says I’m being silly. He says no matter what, there’s ways and ways.

---

## FRAN:

To?

## OWEN:

Have a kid.

---

## FRAN:

You want a kid?

---

## OWEN:

Maybe I’d like to have one. I don’t know. One. It’s expensive though.

---

## FRAN:

Yeah.

---

## OWEN:

I just paid off my last mortgage and I never want to be in debt again. That much I know. My father always said a kid is eighteen years of bills.

---

## FRAN:

That’s one way of looking at it.

---

## OWEN:

It’s the truth. My father’s life was ruined financially because he had three kids. He used to tell us, among us, we were fifty four years of bills.

---

## FRAN:

Nice. And then there’s college.

---

## OWEN:

No way would I pay for college. I didn’t go to college. None of us did.

---

## FRAN:

Do you feel like we’re just surrounded by unforeseen problems. Like fog or something?

---

## OWEN:

Let’s talk about you.

---

## FRAN:

I was. If my laundry can come back after all this time, what else is out there that I don’t know? I mean, maybe bad things.

---

## OWEN:

Why would you go there?

## FRAN:

Where?

---

## OWEN:

Wait a minute.

---

## FRAN:

What?

---

## OWEN:

I think it’s hitting me a little.

---

## FRAN:

What’s happening?

---

## OWEN:

I don’t know. This place seems more glamorous or something.

---

## FRAN:

The lights.

---

## OWEN:

Yeah, the lights are totally happening.
[Sound of grill firing up]
And the grill.

---

## FRAN:

The grill is wild.

---

## OWEN:

And you. You’re starting to happen.

---

## FRAN:

Me? What do you mean I’m happening?

---

## OWEN:

I can’t explain it. You’re...jumping out from the background.

---

## FRAN:

Do you think what we usually see is reality, or this?

---

## OWEN:

I can’t have a conversation like that.

---

## FRAN:

Like what?

## OWEN:

High flown.

---

## FRAN:

I think this is reality.

## OWEN:

Come on. It’s the mushrooms.

---

## FRAN:

Are you lonely?

## OWEN:

Yeah.

---

## FRAN:

We should probably eat.

---

## OWEN:

We can. You just pick from what they have on the display, and they make it. One, two, three.

---

## FRAN:

Do you have trouble making decisions?

## OWEN:

No.

---

## FRAN:

If I go up there and they ask me what I want, I may freak out a little.

---

## OWEN:

Why?

---

## FRAN:

Too much pressure to choose shuts me down. Let me show you something. Look at this.

---

## OWEN:

What is it?

---

## FRAN:

Paint chips.

## OWEN:

Okay.

---

## FRAN:

I was thinking about changing the color of my kitchen so I got these chips. I got it down to these four. Do you know how long I’ve been carrying these chips around?

---

## OWEN:

No.

---

## FRAN:

Three years.

## OWEN:

Whoa.

---

## FRAN:

I can’t choose the color.

---

## OWEN:

They all look about the same to me.

---

## FRAN:

They are all about the same, but I get afraid.

---

## OWEN:

Alright, so...

---

## FRAN:

And if I freak out over something as stupid as paint chips or what to have for dinner, how do you think I am when it’s something important?

---

## OWEN:

Maybe no decision is that important.

---

## FRAN:

That’s not what you think.

---

## OWEN:

We’re two different people.

---

## FRAN:

I think we’re like six different people.

---

## OWEN:

Okay, we’re six different people. Are we hungry?

---

## FRAN:

Yes!

## OWEN:

Now we’re getting somewhere!

---

## FRAN:

You know what? I want chicken!

---

## OWEN:

They don’t have chicken.

---

## FRAN:

What?

## OWEN:

They have beef, vegetables, and all kinds of fish.

---

## FRAN:

I want chicken!

---

## OWEN:

Oh, they’ll make you spaghetti too, if all else fails.

---

## FRAN:

But I want chicken!

---

## OWEN:

And this is exactly when reality becomes super important. You must choose from what exists on the menu, Fran, and not choose the invisible thing in your mind.

---

## FRAN:

But I like the invisible thing best.

---

## OWEN:

That’s the romantic bullshit, and I’m against it. It robs people of their actual lives.

---

## FRAN:

I never thought about it that way.

---

## OWEN:

I’ve thought about it.

---

## FRAN:

This is the best conversation I’ve ever had!

---

## OWEN:

It is?

## FRAN:

Yes!

---

## OWEN:

Me too maybe. It’s the mushrooms.

---

## FRAN:

I don’t care what it is.

## OWEN:

Me neither.

---

[Sound of grill firing up]

---

## FRAN:

Whoa! The grill.

---

## OWEN:

Can we talk about sex again?

---

## FRAN:

Sure. I’m going to put the paint chips away.

## OWEN:

No, let me see.

---

## FRAN:

What are you doing?

---

## OWEN:

I don’t know. Making it like a little accordion.

---

## FRAN:

Oh yeah. What are you going to play a little song?

---

## OWEN:

Right, no, it’s just I’m a private person. I like to fiddle with something to talk about personal things like sex. 

---

Before my back got destroyed, I had a lotta sex, and I was ashamed cause I was raised that sex is bad. 

---

Then after, I had no sex, and now I’m ashamed about that. You know where that leaves me?

---

## FRAN:

Where?

---

## OWEN:

I like never want to think about sex again.

---

## FRAN:

But do you want to have it?

---

## OWEN:

I don’t care. I don’t know. I don’t wanna care either way. I just don’t want to think about it ever again.

---

## FRAN:

You’re scared.

---

## OWEN:

Major. My heart makes a fist when I thinking about trying.

---

## FRAN:

Give me your hand.

## OWEN:

Why?

---

## FRAN:

Because two is stronger than one.

---

## OWEN:

Alright.

---

## FRAN:

You’ve been alone with a big issue.

## OWEN:

What?

---

## FRAN:

Sex.

## OWEN:

Right.

---

## FRAN:

One person can never solve sex. That’s why you’ve felt overwhelmed. It takes two.

---

## OWEN:

I guess that’s true.

---

## FRAN:

I can help you maybe.

---

## OWEN:

How?

## FRAN:

If you let me.

---

## OWEN:

I don’t know. What would you do?

---

## FRAN:

I don’t know.


---

## OWEN:

Whoa.

## FRAN:

Some problems are like a pirate map torn in two.

---

## OWEN:

You just destroyed your thing.

---

## FRAN:

Doesn’t matter. I’m never gonna paint that kitchen.

---

## OWEN:

No?

## FRAN:

No. Focus. You got half the pirate map, and so do I. We each got half the answer.

---

## OWEN:

We’re pirates?

---

## FRAN:

All I’m saying is it takes two to to ...

## OWEN:

Okay, I get it.

---

## FRAN:

You do?

---

## OWEN:

Yeah. But one thing.

## FRAN:

What?

---

## OWEN:

Never ghost me.

---

## FRAN:

You mean like, not return your calls?

## OWEN:

Yeah.

---

## FRAN:

Did your girlfriend do that?

---

## OWEN:

Yeah. At a certain point. That’s gotta be up there with the most awful things you can do to a person.

---

## FRAN:

I don’t think anybody’s ever done it to me.

---

## OWEN:

It’s like you don’t count for anything. Like your terrible pain doesn’t matter to anybody. It’s like you’re dead but the suffering goes on. 

---

She said she loved me, but she wasn’t in love with me anymore. Becausa the sex. And when I thought about that, I thought, isn’t love bigger than that? 

---

Isn’t love bigger than being in love? I mean, much bigger? How could you love someone, and then just drop them? I’m sorry.

---

## FRAN:

For what?

---

## OWEN:

You understand what I’m saying.

---

## FRAN:

Yeah. I get it. I’ll never ghost you.

---

## OWEN:

Cool. Okay. So what do you want?

---

## FRAN:

From Life?

## OWEN:

No! For dinner.

---

## FRAN:

Chicken!

## OWEN:

Me too! And it’s not on the menu!

---

## FRAN:

What are we gonna do?

## OWEN:

About what?

---

## FRAN:

We both want something we can’t have.

---

## OWEN:

That’s romance and I’m against it. I want something that I can actually have.

---

## FRAN:

Maybe you’re right.

## OWEN:

I’m right.

---

## FRAN:

We have to make a decision.

---

## OWEN:

Listen, Fran. I’m gonna say this to you. You don’t have to do anything that you don’t want to do. That’s always an option.

---

## FRAN:

I know! But that’s been the problem. Like my last boyfriend, he wanted to take things to the next level, but I wouldn’t. 

---

Because it was easier not to make up my mind. And guess what? He left. 

---

Why are you smiling?

## OWEN:

I don’t know.

---

## FRAN:

I like thinking about the dinner we can’t have.

## OWEN:

Me too.

---

## FRAN:

It’s almost like having it. Now you direct my thoughts. What should I think about now?

---

## OWEN:

Nothing.

## FRAN:

That’s hard.

---

## OWEN:

Give yourself a break for once.  Let’s step outside of things, you know? Let’s just look at the lights.

---

## FRAN:

Do you believe in ancestors?

---

## OWEN:

Ancestors? You mean like dead people?

---

## FRAN:

No, no. Like these lights. What if everybody’s like these lights and it’s all around us, and we’re not alone, and it’s good, you know?

---

## OWEN:

What are we talking about?

---

## FRAN:

Why shouldn’t we just enjoy our lives Owen?

## OWEN:

I guess we should

---

## FRAN:

I just want to be happy

## OWEN:

Yeah, Me too!

---

[Grill fires up, applause]
## OWEN:

Whoa. The grill.

## FRAN:

The grill.

---

## FRAN:

I can’t believe you found my laundry.

---

## OWEN:

Yeah. It’s kind of amazing.

---

## FRAN:

Maybe anything is possible.

---

## OWEN:

Yeah.

---

[jazz music]

---

## SUSIE:

What?! What?! I can’t believe it! Goddammit! Well, that’s the icing on the cake. Surprise, surprise, you know? I could spit! 

---

No, I will not be doing that. So predictable! It’s like by-the-numbers predictable! 

---

Sorry to go off on you, Teresa. Thanks for letting me know. Thanks. Okay. 

---

Fran! Fran! You’re not going to believe this.

---

## FRAN:

What is it?

---

## SUSIE:

Roger’s in jail.

## FRAN:

He’s in jail?

---

## SUSIE:

He was dealing drugs out of his car. In Tampa. The Florida State troopers have him.

---

## FRAN:

Does he have a lawyer?

## SUSIE:

Who cares?

---

## FRAN:

Well, he’s going to need a lawyer.

---

## SUSIE:

Who cares about that asshole and his ff’ing recovery? He’s a criminal! You know what? I can’t think about it. We can’t think about it. We’ve got other fish to fry.

---

## FRAN:

Right.

---

## SUSIE:

The BQE is going to be a nightmare. You packed? This is it. We need to go.

---

## FRAN:

No. I’m not coming.

## SUSIE:

What?

---

## FRAN:

I’m not coming.

---

## SUSIE:

What do you mean you’re not coming? She’s dying.

## FRAN:

You don’t know that.

---

## SUSIE:

Why’d you pack a suitcase if you’re not going?

---

## FRAN:

I guess because I changed my mind while I was packing.

## SUSIE:

It’s your sister.

---

## FRAN:

I’ve been down there twice already.

## SUSIE:

So what?

---

## FRAN:

You didn’t go the last time.

---

## SUSIE:

Don’t you think I feel bad about that? Tyler was sick.

---

## FRAN:

Well, I have stuff, too.

## SUSIE:

Don’t you want to be there?

---

## FRAN:

I’ve been there.

## SUSIE:

But this is it.

---

## FRAN:

You mean, you think I should be in on the kill?

---

## SUSIE:

What are you, crazy?! What kind of thing is that to say? No, I don’t mean anything like that. Collect yourself. 

---

You’re gonna regret if you don’t go, Fran. She’s forty eight. This is a tragedy. Her children are huddled around her, waiting for her to get better. 

---

She’s not going to get better. They need us. And you need to be there for you.

---

## FRAN:

No, I don’t.

---

## SUSIE:

Yes, you do. Listen to me. You’re just having a moment. Even if you feel like hiding from it now, later you’ll see. I’m right about this.

---

## FRAN:

So let me find out for myself.

---

## SUSIE:

I would but there’s no time for that.

## FRAN:

There has to be time.

---

## SUSIE:

The BQE is going to be like an oil painting!

## FRAN:

I don’t care about the BQE! 

---

I need more time, room, right now in this conversation.

## SUSIE:

Okay.

---

## FRAN:

I’m not really being given a chance to figure out what’s important.

---

## SUSIE:

What do you mean?

## FRAN:

I’m seeing somebody.

---

## SUSIE:

Who?

## FRAN:

A man. And I don’t want to leave him right now.

---

## SUSIE:

Who... What man? What are you talking about?

## FRAN:

I’ve fallen in love.

---

## SUSIE:

You have not.

## FRAN:

I’m on the way.

---

## SUSIE:

I don’t understand. When did you meet this guy?

---

## FRAN:

Three weeks ago. Just about.

---

## SUSIE:

You met a guy three weeks ago and you would ignore the death of your sister to... What are you saying? To go on a date with him?

---

## FRAN:

Another date. Yes.

## SUSIE:

That’s crazy.

---

## FRAN:

Not to me.

## SUSIE:

You can do that when you come back.

---

## FRAN:

We don’t know how long it will be.

## SUSIE:

Are you serious?

---

## FRAN:

There’s a momentum to these things and if you miss it, the window closes.

---

## SUSIE:

The window that’s closing for good is on Trish’s life. Are you this desperate?

---

## FRAN:

If she’s dying, she’s dying. She’ll be dead and I’ll be stuck here alive with no one if I don’t...give life a chance.

---

## SUSIE:

You make it sound noble.

## FRAN:

I’m not trying to sound anything. We don’t know that she’s dying.

---

## SUSIE:

She’s dying.

## FRAN:

It could takes months.

---

## SUSIE:

Weeks.

## FRAN:

Weeks is a long time right now. In my life. She won’t even know I’m there.

---

## SUSIE:

You don’t know that.

## FRAN:

She’s in a coma. 

---

She went into a coma when I was down the last time. She’s still in a coma. I saw her when she was still conscious, when she knew I was there. 

---

We talked. I told her how I felt. She was able to acknowledge me. That was the important time. When she knew I was there. 

---

Now it’s what? I’m going for me? I don’t need it. I need love. I need companionship. I need a next step. 

---

This guy, we slept together.

---

## SUSIE:

So what?

## FRAN:

For him it’s a big deal.

---

## SUSIE:

I need you.

## FRAN:

Why?

---

## SUSIE:

To face this. I need you to stand with me. I shouldn’t have to explain.

---

## FRAN:

If I’m there, and Trish dies, and I come home, and my guy’s gone, what have I got? A dead sister and nothing.

---

## SUSIE:

Does he know?

## FRAN:

Does he know what? No.

---

## SUSIE:

How do you think he’d feel about that?

## FRAN:

Not good.

---

## SUSIE:

Of course he wouldn’t. No decent person would. If you told him, he’d urge you to go I’m sure.

---

## FRAN:

Of course he would. That’s not the point. The point is, if I lay the sadness and tragedy of this family on him at such an early point, it will make him feel like that’s what he’s in for. 

---

Sadness and weight. Those are not the associations I want him to have for me.

---

## SUSIE:

What’s his name?

## FRAN:

Owen.

---

## SUSIE:

Well, I think you’re shortchanging Owen. I think you should give him the chance to step up.

---

## FRAN:

A man shouldn’t have to step up three weeks after he meets a woman.

---

## SUSIE:

Life is what it is. It makes the demands it makes.

## FRAN:

And life is laying out two choices for me. 

---

All I’ve ever dreamed of is finishing the part of my life where I’m a member of this goddamn family, and starting the part of my life where it’s my life. My family. My time.

---

## SUSIE:

What do you mean? You don’t want to be my sister?

---

## FRAN:

Not really. No.

---

## SUSIE:

Well, tough! You are! And those kids down there in Pennsylvania, they’re your niece and your nephew.

## FRAN:

I don’t even know them.

---

## SUSIE:

What are you talking about? You were there when they were born. You know them.

---

## FRAN:

I’m not really interested in other peoples’ kids, Susie. I want my own.

---

## SUSIE:

And you love Tyler!

## FRAN:

He’s sweet, but he’s not mine. He’s yours.

---

## SUSIE:

Why are you acting like this? What is this brutality coming from you?

---

## FRAN:

I have to be forceful. I know you want me to go, and I have a different choice I want to make.

---

I can’t be reasonable anymore. I’ve always done what this family wanted me to do and what do I have to show for it? Nothing. Look at me.

---

## SUSIE:

You have a family.

## FRAN:

No, YOU have a family, a husband, a kid. Trish may be dying, but at least she did it.

---

She has kids. All I have is a history of guilt and bullshit. A studio apartment. Woo hoo! Skirts and shoes. I haven’t had a meaningful boyfriend in years. 

---

I met this guy and he’s actually available. He has a business. He wants a home. I think he wants a wife. He’s even open to having a child. Maybe even with me. 

---

Imagine me having a child of my own. I know it’s a long shot, every guy is, but I haven’t even been in the game, 

---

## SUSIE:

Marriage isn’t so great.

---

## FRAN:

You’d do anything to keep your marriage going. Don’t bullshit me.

---

## SUSIE:

It’s hard work.

## FRAN:

I bust my ass in a meaningless job. I’m not lazy.

---

## SUSIE:

Nobody said you were.

---

## FRAN:

It’s easy for me to get in the car with you. Go along with what you want. This is work. Fighting with you. 

---

But I have to clear a place for my own life to happen. I can’t postpone my turn anymore. I have to take the plunge.

---

## SUSIE:

Take the plunge, hah? You have no idea.

## FRAN:

Of what?

---

## SUSIE:

Gus is a nightmare.

## FRAN:

Oh don’t. What are you talking about?

---

## SUSIE:

Trish is the only person who’s ever been there for me. Since Mom went. Not you. Not Gus. He’s my husband on paper, but there’s nothing there. 

---

He hasn’t shown up for me ever. I’ll tell you a home truth. The women in our family are absolute shit at men. 

---

Now Trish is dying, and I may not make it. Do you understand? I need you, Fran. When Trish is gone, I’m going to fall to pieces.

---

## FRAN:

You have your son.

## SUSIE:

Tyler’s six. You can’t lean on a six year old.

---

## FRAN:

Well, you can’t lean on me, either. I won’t let you! I’m done! I want things.

---

## SUSIE:

I have cancer!

## FRAN:

What?

---

## SUSIE:

When I go down there, and I look at Trish in that bed, that’s going to be me.

---

## FRAN:

What are you talking about?

---

## SUSIE:

I have pancreatic cancer.

---

## FRAN:

What do you mean, when did you find this out?

---

## SUSIE:

That’s why I couldn’t go down the last time, not Tyler.

---

## FRAN:

What’s the treatment?

## SUSIE:

I’ve got three months tops. Probably less.

---

## FRAN:

God, what is it with this family? Are we just cursed? Mom and Trish, now you?

---

## SUSIE:

I wasn’t going to tell you.

## FRAN:

I wish you hadn’t. Get a second opinion.

---

## SUSIE:

I have.

## FRAN:

A third!

---

## SUSIE:

I was going to wait until Trish...was gone. So you could have your time with her. I probably would’ve ended up telling you in the car. 

---

I’m so completely worried. Gus isn’t going to be there for Tyler. The kid has a learning disability. To Gus he’s just a write off. 

---

He’ll marry some corporate witch and Tyler will be shoved in the darkest corner they can find. Trish was the obvious one for me to turn to, but she’s going to be gone before me. 

---

And she’s a single mom. Her two, what’s going to happen to them? Do you think their father’s going to take them in? He’s in jail! 

---

He hasn’t paid child support in two years. He couldn’t get custody of a lamp! Don’t you see what’s got to happen, Fran? It’s you.

---

## FRAN:

Me?

---

## SUSIE:

Her two, and Tyler, they’re going to need you. They’re going to have to be with you. You’re the only one.

---

## FRAN:

What are you talking about?

## SUSIE:

You heard me.

---

## FRAN:

You’re not going to die!

## SUSIE:

I am.

---

## FRAN:

Get a second opinion.

---

## SUSIE:

I’ve gotten all the opinions. The treatment is morphine. I’m done.

---

## FRAN:

Are you on morphine now?

---

## SUSIE:

No. Vicodin.

---

## FRAN:

Are you seriously suggesting that I’m going to take on three children?

---

## SUSIE:

Yes.

---

## FRAN:

This is a joke.

---

## SUSIE:

Well, you wanted a family of your own.

## FRAN:

Get off it.

---

## SUSIE:

And you wanted to get rid of us. Well, we’re done. We’re gone.

---

## FRAN:

What’s Gus saying?

---

## SUSIE:

He doesn’t know.

---

## FRAN:

Tell him!

---

## SUSIE:

I want to get my ducks in a row first. If I go to Gus with this, I have to be able to tell him what’s going to happen. If it’s easy, he’ll do it.

---

## FRAN:

What’s easy about it?

---

## SUSIE:

Easy for him. That’s all he cares about.

---

## FRAN:

Well. No.

---

## SUSIE:

You’ll do it.

## FRAN:

No, I won’t.

---

## SUSIE:

This guy probably won’t work out anyway.

## FRAN:

How do you know?

---

## SUSIE:

It’s not important. You were right. It’s going to be too much for any new guy.

---

## FRAN:

I’m not going down there with you.

## SUSIE:

Yes you are.

---

I can see stuff now. Everything’s clearer to me. If you don’t get in the car, where are you going?

---

## FRAN:

On with my life.

## SUSIE:

No. If you don’t get in the car, your life stops!

---

## FRAN:

I’m going to date this guy.

---

## SUSIE:

If you can’t tell him these realities, it’s not real. You’ll fall through the ice.

---

## FRAN:

I’m entitled to some happiness.

## SUSIE:

You’re entitled to nothing and you know it! 

---

Life is work! Life is responsibility! Happiness is a minute here and there! If you’re lucky!

---

## FRAN:

So now you know what life is?

---

## SUSIE:

Yes. Mine’s over, almost over, so I get to say, yeah.

---

[Susie begins to cry]

## SUSIE:

It’s okay.

---

## FRAN:

This can’t be happening.

## SUSIE:

I know.

---

## FRAN:

I love you.

## SUSIE:

I know.

---

## FRAN:

I always thought one day we’d connect, we’d have a new relationship.

## SUSIE:

We’re having it right now, baby.

---

## FRAN:

Oh my God, I said the same thing to Trish. I’ve missed everything. I’m losing everything.

## SUSIE:

No, you’re not.

---

## FRAN:

I’m so selfish.

## SUSIE:

No.

---

## FRAN:

I can’t take care of three kids.

---

## SUSIE:

Trish’s oldest can help. Nancy. She’s very responsible.

---

## FRAN:

She’s ten.

---

## SUSIE:

And I’m going to see about money. I have insurance. There’ll be some money. And Trish’s insurance. I’m looking into that.

---

## FRAN:

I can’t drive down there like this. I feel faint. I’ll crash the car.

---

## SUSIE:

I’ll drive.

---

## FRAN:

Are you in pain?

---

## SUSIE:

Not too bad.

---

## FRAN:

How can you be so calm?

---

## SUSIE:

I’ve had some time to take it in. I found somebody to talk to. Maybe you should see her, too.

---

## FRAN:

Maybe.

---

## SUSIE:

It’s a wake up call.

## FRAN:

Was I asleep?

---

## SUSIE:

Yes. You know what I want to say to you? It’s kind of crazy but I’m going to say it. You’re a woman.

---

## FRAN:

What’s that mean?

---

## SUSIE:

You’re a woman and YOU’RE MY SISTER.

---

## FRAN:

Give me the keys.

---

## SUSIE:

Are you sure?

---

## FRAN:

I would do anything for you.

---

## SUSIE:

I know.

---

## FRAN:

Baby.


## SUSIE:

You see?

---

## FRAN:

Anything you need.

## SUSIE:

I know. I know.

---

I’m going to be watching over you.

---

## FRAN:

Oh God, don’t let this happen.

## SUSIE:

It’ll be alright.

---

## SUSIE:

What?

---

## FRAN:

Nothing. I said to him. ‘Why can’t I just get hit by a car?’

---

## SUSIE:

I don’t understand.

---

## FRAN:

I didn’t think anybody was listening.

---

## SUSIE:

Someone’s always listening. She’s here, you know.

---

## FRAN:

Who?

---

## SUSIE:

Mom.

---

## FRAN:

I know. Christ. I can smell the soap.

## SUSIE:

Yeah.

---

## FRAN:

I have such a feeling.

## SUSIE:

What?

---

## FRAN:

For the first time in my life, I know where I’m going.


---

[Jazz music, City Sounds]

---

## OWEN :

Hey Fran, I’m just checking in. I was thinking you might want to take the tour tomorrow. See my store in Queens.

---

Gets some fajitas or something. CHICKEN fajitas. Let me know. I like your message. Very straightforward. 

---

I kept that quarter you found on my floor. That’s my lucky quarter now. I’m sending you... I’m thinking of you, okay? I’m thinking of you.

[Doorbell]
## FRAN:

Hi.

---

## OWEN:

Oh, hey.

---

## FRAN:

What’s up?

---

## OWEN:

I’ve been busy. I had a plumbing thing, a flood. In one of the other stores.

---

## FRAN:

You stopped returning my calls.

## OWEN:

I’ve been busy, like I said. And I needed a minute.

---

## FRAN:

It’s been a lot longer than a minute. How much does that weigh?

---

## OWEN:

Okay. Whoa. Thirty eight pounds.

---

## FRAN:

Yeah. New realities. I should have known.

## OWEN:

What?

---

## FRAN:

When a guy goes off on an issue, it’s his issue.

---

## OWEN:

Meaning what?

## FRAN:

You ghosted me.

---

## OWEN:

Not really.

## FRAN:

Don’t. 

---

You made a big speech about nobody should ghost anybody, and then you ghosted me.

---

## OWEN:

You ghosted me. I didn’t hear from you for ten days.

---

## FRAN:

My sister died.

## OWEN:

I didn’t know why.

---

## FRAN:

And then you did.

---

## OWEN:

And by that time, you’d already blown up our future.

## FRAN:

How you figure that?

---

## OWEN:

You tell me you’re taking on three kids, what am I supposed to say? Great?

---

## FRAN:

I tried to explain.

## OWEN:

After the fact.

---

## FRAN:

Did you even listen to my messages?

## OWEN:

Some of them.

---

## FRAN:

My sister died. My other sister’s very sick.

---

## OWEN:

I know. I’m sorry. But still.

---

## FRAN:

But still what?

## OWEN:

What do you think? I freaked out.

---

## FRAN:

Teenagers freak out.

## OWEN:

I have my reasons. You don’t know. 

---

How’d you even catch me in? I’m almost never here.

---

## FRAN:

I watched for your car.

---

## OWEN:

I’m seeing somebody else.

---

## FRAN:

What? Oh. Okay.

---

## OWEN:

You really upset me. You made a huge decision without talking to me.

---

## FRAN:

It had nothing to do with you.

## OWEN:

How can you say that? That’s just insulting.

---

## FRAN:

So now you’re the wounded party?

## OWEN:

I need to be taken into account.

---

## FRAN:

When did I say different?

## OWEN:

Actions speak.

---

## FRAN:

Okay.

## OWEN:

Look. You’re gonna have to help me out here.

---

## FRAN:

With what?

---

## OWEN:

Put your bag in that cart. My back’s been really bad. It’ll explode if I pick that up.

---

## FRAN:

No problem.

---

## OWEN:

So why’d you show up today?

## FRAN:

Somebody had to. And I’m moving.

---

## OWEN:

Where?

## FRAN:

Pennsylvania. A trailer. Then I don’t know.

---

## OWEN:

A trailer in Pennsylvania.

## FRAN:

Yeah. My sister’s kids have to finish school.

---

## OWEN:

What about your job?

## FRAN:

I hadda quit.

---

## OWEN:

When do you want this?

## FRAN:

What?

---

## OWEN:

Your laundry.

## FRAN:

Couple of days will be fine. 

---

I’m here for one more week. This should finish off my credit.

---

## OWEN:

What credit?

## FRAN:

I had a credit. Fifty something dollars.

---

## OWEN:

That credit was because we lost your laundry, but I found your laundry, so actually, you owe ME money.

---

## FRAN:

You’re not serious?

## OWEN:

Look, I run a business.

---

## FRAN:

You’re going to be that much of an asshole?

## OWEN:

I’m the asshole? 

---

You got into my life, you you you opened me up, and drop this bomb on me like I was nothing. What’s the matter with you?

---

## FRAN:

Don’t ask me that.

## OWEN:

I AM asking. What’s the matter with you?

---

## FRAN:

You wanna know what’s the matter with me? NAME SOMETHING! EVERYTHING! I’m a mess! I’m at my limit!

---

## OWEN:

Whoa.

## FRAN:

I can’t explain! I have no patience! 

---

I know I probably should have talked it over with you, but the writing was on the wall, and I was beyond overwhelmed.

---

## OWEN:

You owed me a conversation.

## FRAN:

We talked.

---

## OWEN:

Not at the time. Ten days later.

## FRAN:

You should have answered my calls.

---

## OWEN:

You called me after the fact. The decision was made. You took on the kids. You know what? I just hate being a man. I hate the things we have to say.

---

## FRAN:

Well, I hate being a woman. I hate the things we have to DO. 

---

Admit it. You and me, you didn’t want me. You just wanted somebody to fill the slot your fiancé left. When things got real, you were gone.

---

## OWEN:

What a crock.

## FRAN:

It’s the truth.

---

## OWEN:

I had sex with you. We had sex.

## FRAN:

So?

---

## OWEN:

So? Don’t. I trusted you. I had a shit ton of anxiety about sex, and you knew that, and I believed you would understand what it meant. To me. And then you were gone.

---

## FRAN:

I’m sorry.

## OWEN:

Okay. 

---

So here we are. What do you want from me?

---

## FRAN:

I don’t know. This was a bad idea. Look. I’ll take my bag back.

## OWEN:

Don’t.

---

## FRAN:

I’m sorry, but I can’t really afford to blow fifty bucks on a gesture. I’ve got a lot on my plate.

---

## OWEN:

Don’t touch that bag.

## FRAN:

Why not?

---

## OWEN:

You sabotaged us. Why?

## FRAN:

I got hit by a car, okay? I have custody of three kids. That’s the news. 

---

Actually two, but the third’s coming. And there’s not enough money. And there are lawyers to be paid. And grief. And other things.

---

## OWEN:

How old are the kids?

## FRAN:

Young.

---

## OWEN:

I’m sorry.

## FRAN:

Thanks.

---

## OWEN:

But you didn’t handle it right.

---

## FRAN:

You’re right. I coulda told you earlier, and I could have told you more. 

---

I guess I wanted you to see me as a positive package. For as long as I could. So I could maybe grow on you.

---

## OWEN:

How would you feel if you were me?

## FRAN:

I have no idea.

---

## OWEN:

Sometimes a bond is formed, sooner rather than later.

## FRAN:

I know. I know that.

---

## OWEN:

You have three kids?

## FRAN:

Yeah.

---

## OWEN:

Just like that?

## FRAN:

Pretty much. 

---

Next week, I’m applying for food stamps. That’s my life now. 

---

I thought about calling you, then I thought of what you said about kids. I did the math. Three kids is fifty years of bills.

---

## OWEN:

That was my father. He was right though.

---

## FRAN:

I’ve turned into everything you don’t want.

## OWEN:

That’s for me to say.

---

## FRAN:

You did say. Actions speak. You went dark.

## OWEN:

I guess I did.

---

## FRAN:

I get it. It’s just the way it is. Come on. I’m gonna go.

---

## OWEN:

Wait.

## FRAN:

For what? For you to catch up with yourself? 

---

You turned your back on me, Owen.

## OWEN:

You turned your back on me first. 

---

When you left me out of your life at the crucial moment. Don’t dance around that. I hate this whole thing. This is why I didn’t call. I didn’t want to go through this.

## FRAN:

Because you’re a coward?

## OWEN:

No. Because I knew where we’d end up, and I wasn’t ready for that.

---

## FRAN:

For it to be over.

---

## OWEN:

Give me a minute!

## FRAN:

No. Look. This is horrible. Just let me get my stuff and get out of here.

---

## OWEN:

You’re not the only one who feels pain.

## FRAN:
I know. And I’m sorry.

---

## OWEN:

You should have called.

## FRAN:

I should have, you should have. Come on. We’re beating a dead horse.

---

## OWEN:

Right.

## FRAN:

It broke my heart when you stopped answering me.

---

## OWEN:

I didn’t know what to say! Look at it from my point of view. Three kids.

## FRAN:

Yeah.

---

## OWEN:

I can’t believe you took that on. How can you possibly handle that?

---

## FRAN:

You think I woulda if I had a choice?

## OWEN:

Didn’t you?

---

## FRAN:

Yeah, I guess I did. There was a moment and I did choose. That’s the truth. It’s just rough.

---

## OWEN:

I couldn’t do it.

---

## FRAN:

You know what amazes me? I used to think I didn’t understand my mother. I was wrong. I understood her perfectly. 

---

It was myself I didn’t understand.

## OWEN:

And now you do?

---

## FRAN:

It’s funny. When push came to shove, it’s you that turned out to be the romantic.

## OWEN:

I don’t understand.

---

## FRAN:

You want something that’s not on the menu. I’m nothing but real now. And it’s rough. No pretty lights. Doesn’t matter.

---

## OWEN:

Well. Listen. You can have the credit.

---

## FRAN:

I don’t want it.

## OWEN:

Okay. I hope things go good for you.

---

## FRAN:

Thanks. You were right. It was just the mushrooms.

## OWEN:

I don’t want to be right.

---

## FRAN:

THEN DON’T BE! I really admire the people who just do it, you know? They just pickup their shit and they never say a word. 

---

I shouldn’t have come. I knew all this already. When I was a kid, we’d play Hearts, and my sister would say “No talking about your cards.” 

---

And she was right. What’s the point of beating it to death? Just play your hand, right? Straight up. A good lesson. 

---

I’m gonna teach it to my kids. Just play the cards you’re dealt, and... I’m so ashamed.

---

## OWEN:

Of what?

## FRAN:

I don’t know. Bye.

---


---

## OWEN:

I’m not seeing anybody.

---

---

## OWEN:

3210, Blastoff

---

## FRAN [Voicemail]:
Hi, This is Frances Costello. I’m not here right now, but if you leave a message, I’ll call you back.

---

---

[Doorbell rings]

## FRAN:

You rang?

---

## OWEN:

Yeah.

---

## FRAN:

No message.

## OWEN:

No.

---

## FRAN:

There’s so many things I’ve been afraid of, Owen. Maybe you, too. Look. I’m sorry I freaked you out.

---

## OWEN:

Thanks.

## FRAN:

I wasn’t built for these dramatic things.

---

## OWEN:

Me neither.

---

## FRAN:

I’m not strong. When I think of my mother and my sisters, I have to ask, how’d they do it? How’d they bear it? 

---

Kids, sickness, death. It’s a mystery, that kind of strength. I’m scared and I don’t want to be bitter. 

---

There’s things I can say and there’s things I won’t say. I gotta handle this right, so it sits okay with me down the road. 

---

For me, it’s you. I choose you. And I’m asking you to choose me. As I am.

---

## OWEN:

Look Fran, this last few weeks have been like...

## FRAN:

Wait. And it’s worse than you think. I’m pregnant.

---

## OWEN:

WHAT?!

## FRAN:

So it’s four kids. It’ll be four kids.

---

## OWEN:

I... You’re what?!

## FRAN:

I wasn’t going to tell you.

---

## OWEN:

What were you going to do?!

## FRAN:

I don’t know. Suck it up somehow.

---

## OWEN:

So you’re going to have it?!

## FRAN:

One way or the other.

---

## OWEN:

I can’t think!

## FRAN:

Me neither.

---

## OWEN:

It’s a disaster!

## FRAN:

Yeah.

---

## OWEN:

You can’t expect me to...sign on to this!

## FRAN:

I don’t expect anything. 

---

But you called me back, Owen. And when you did that, I had to tell you.

---

## OWEN:

Right.

## FRAN:

Right.

---

## OWEN:

You’re a... So I’m... Jeez.

---

## FRAN:

What?

## OWEN:

Don’t do anything. Don’t say anything.

---

## FRAN:

Should I put down this freakin bag?!

## OWEN:

No!

---

## FRAN:

Then I’m leaving!

## OWEN:

Don’t leave.

---

## FRAN:

Why not?

## OWEN:

I don’t know.

---

## FRAN:

If you’re gonna talk, then you’d better start saying something! This bag weighs thirty eight pounds.

---

## OWEN:

Give me your hand.

## FRAN:

Why?

---

## OWEN:

Give me your freakin hand.

## FRAN:

Are you sure?

---

## OWEN:

No! Put that down.

---

## FRAN:

My father left us when we were kids. My sisters married assholes. All the women in my family die way young.

---

## OWEN:

Shut up.

## FRAN:

A hundred years of bills.

---

## OWEN:

If you gotta talk, say something encouraging.

---

## FRAN:

And there’s two dogs.

## OWEN:

Encouraging?

---

## FRAN:

Alright. Two is stronger than one.

---

## OWEN:

I had a pretty good life till you showed up.

---

## FRAN:

You did not.

## OWEN:

Shut up!

---

## FRAN:

No, you shut up!

## OWEN:

No, you shut up!

---

## FRAN:

Okay, Tarzan.

---

## OWEN:

You have to be quiet I swear to God!

## FRAN:

I’m stopped. I stopped.

---

## OWEN:

Make a space. For me.

---

## FRAN:

Go.

---

## OWEN:

Alright, I’m in.

---

## FRAN:

Yeah?

## OWEN:

Yeah.

---

## FRAN:

For all of it?

## OWEN:

For all of it.

---

## FRAN:

Are you crazy?

## OWEN:

No, but I can’t feel my face.

---

## FRAN:

You know what?

## OWEN:

What?

---

## FRAN:

You gotta excuse me, but I gotta say it. 

---

You’re a man, Owen. I didn’t even know what that was, but here you are. You’re a man. And I mean that like forever.
