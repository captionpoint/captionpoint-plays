## ANN:
Hello. I’ll be playing Peter Pan.

---

This is something of a relic.

---

Peter Pan, presented by the Davenport Children’s Theatre in Davenport, Iowa, 1955.

---

Let’s see. . . Mr. Smee—played by Bump Heeter. Tinker Bell—played by herself, of course.

---

Mrs. Darling—Mary Ellen Hurlbutt— oh my God she was in my wedding.

---

When she was still a Hurlbutt. We used to call her Fling Fanny.

---

Our first production was at the Shriner’s temple,

---

a big building on Brady Street, where the Shriners did mysterious things.

---

Then we upgraded to the Orpheum, a real movie theater, where Mary Martin once performed.

---

I met her when she came through town.

---

Mom took me behind the proscenium to her dressing room…It was thrilling.

---

Our picture was taken for the local paper and she signed my script:

---

To Ann, Peter Pan, with love, Mary Martin, Peter.

---

I was so flustered. I forgot my script in the dressing room

---

and so she sent down my script and a bouquet of flowers.

---

The director—Mary Fluhrer Nighswander—

---

had a little acting studio above Hicky’s lunch counter.

---

She was married to a chiropractor

---

my father, being a medical doctor, thought chiropractors were charlatans,

---

and Davenport, Iowa, among its other claims to fame,

---

is the birthplace of the chiropractic art, or “science”..

---

But Mr. Nighswander—we called him Doc— designed our flying apparatus. It was—functional.

---

They put a lot of Kotex in your pants

---

because the flying apparatus cut into your thighs.

---

And of course, I was being asked to sing at the same time.

---

It was a bit of an ordeal because the technique wasn’t fully mastered.

---

Sometimes I’d be sort of dragged across the floor and then up.

---

I remember, at my sixty-fifth birthday, one of my brothers was giving a toast and said:

---

“Can you believe she played Peter Pan?” Everyone laughed.

---

I wasn’t sure if it was a joke about my age, or my fear of flying, or my waistline—or all three.

---

At any rate everyone laughed.

---

But I wasn’t ever scared to fly in a theater. I loved it—it was a great excitement.

---

It was after I had children I was afraid to fly;
 
I’m one of those people who thinks they have to keep the plane aloft by worrying.

---

My worry keeps so many things aloft…Or did, until the inevitable inertia crept in and so many people started dying.

---

My husband, my mother, and now—

---

But let’s not talk about that.

---

My father is a great lover of roses and grew them in the backyard.

---

He was out of the house a lot when I was little because he vaccinated, weighed,

---

and generally took care of all the babies in town.

---

He always carried around his brown doctor’s bag, just in case.

---

The mumps, the measles, rubella— coxsackie virus,

---

these were the siren songs that kept him out of the house on 111 McClellan Boulevard.

---

So there were lots of things he missed in my childhood.

---

But he never missed me playing Peter Pan.

He said: “If your dad is in pain, we can up the dosage of morphine.

Otherwise, we’ll just have to wait.

But there are euthanasia laws in the state of Iowa. And this is a Catholic hospital.”

It’s not about rushing, my God. It’s about staying ahead of the pain.

## ANN:
It just— it reminds me of when we put the dog down— her body was riddled with cancer— she couldn’t walk, bleeding on the floor,

it seemed like the right thing to do— but in the moment—at the vet—

she sort of woke up—came to herself— she had these bright eyes—I was holding her paw—

then this sterile injection—she looked up at me with these big eyes“— like forgive them they know not what they do—

You were all grown up and out of the house.

---

## ANN:
Would Mom go with you to Mass?

---

## MICHAEL:
No, Mom was a Lutheran atheist to the bitter end. She said:

---

“I never understood how there could be a Heaven. It would be too heavy and all the bodies would fall down.”

---

## WENDY:
She used to say: “Man created God as a means of social control.

---

Religion teaches you not to think.”

---

## ANN:
Well, I guess I associate religion with stupidity too.

---

## MICHAEL:
Jesus, Ann.

---

## ANN:
Sorry. Well, the religious right anyway.

---

## JOHN:
Liberals make the mistake of conflating religion with ignorance,

---

it’s an ethical and a tactical error—

---

## WENDY:
Could we please not say “liberal” or “conservative” tonight? I’m not in the mood, I’m really not.

---

## JOHN:
Sorry.

---

## JIM:
Here, have some Jameson’s, you’ll feel better.

---

## WENDY:
No thanks. I’m going to get some water. Would anyone else like water?

---

## ANN:
No thanks.

---

## JOHN:
Nah.

---

## JIM:
Uh-uh.

---

## JOHN:
Ann, when did you stop going to church?

---

## ANN:
I was taking the pill after I gave birth to Katherine,

---

and I was going to Mass at St. Clement’s where she was baptized and I thought,

---
 
Well, I’m taking birth control so I’m in mortal sin, and it’s hypocritical for me to go to church,

---
 
I should stay home and read the New York Times instead—

---

## JOHN:
Ah, yes the great church of the New York Times—

---

## ANN:
All right—

---

## MICHAEL:
“Annie,  I remember you as quite the Catholic. We would all be in the basement during a tornado

---

and you were maybe twelve years old leading the Act of Contrition and of course a few Hail Mary’s thrown in—

---

## ANN:
I probably liked the drama of it.

---

I loved all the drama—the May altars—

---

## ALL:
♪ oh Mary we crown thee with blossoms today, queen of the angels, queen of the May— ♪

## ANN:

And the mournful advent songs— Midnight Mass—everything about Christmas—

---

## JOHN:
Remember the year of the lutefisk?

---

## JIM:
Oh God the lutefisk.

---

## MICHAEL:
Mother decided to get in touch with her Scandinavian roots—

---

## ANN:
Oh it was awful!

---

## MICHAEL:
The smell—

---

## JIM:
An affront to the olfactory nerves—

---

## ANN:
The texture!

---

## MICHAEL:
Gelatinous gobs of herring—

---

## WENDY:
Preserved in lye—

---

## ANN:
Lye, can you imagine!

---

## JOHN:
But we were really uncharitable —no one would eat it— Mother was reduced to tears—

---

## JIM:
We were pretty merciless—

---

## WENDY:
You were.

---

## ANN:
 
One year Mom and I shopped for dresses for the Christmas dance

---

and we found two we both liked and —if you can imagine —I had a hard time choosing.

---

## JOHN:
What?

## JIM:
NO! MICHAEL; Impossible

## WENDY:
Not you, Annie!

---

## ANN:
Anyway, I finally chose one— It was blue chiffon.

---

And then on Christmas morning my other dress was there—green satin.

---

## WENDY:
Oh! The green satin—

---

## ANN:
With the square neck, square back, and big bow in the back. It was such a surprise.

---

## JOHN:
Remember the Santa paper?

---

## ANN:
Mom would be wrapping and smoking all night—

---

## MICHAEL:
Amazing she didn’t burn the house down—

---

## JOHN:
And one year she ran out of Santa paper in the middle of the night

---

—it was an emergency —she was so worried Wendy would realize—

---

## WENDY:
Aw, Mom.

---

## JIM:
Remember Otto Stegmaier?

---

## ALL:
(echo “Otto Stegmaier”)

---

## JIM:
 
When I was eight, he made an off-the-cuff comment about Santa Claus being a phony.

---

And he turned to me and asked me if I still believed in him.
 
Honestly, I’d never given it a moment’s thought. I said, “Nah, I don’t believe in him.”
 
The tone of his question left only one possible answer.
 
I sort of succumbed to the tone and believed the answer.

---

And I think I got that one right . . .

---

## WENDY:
Well, I think that’s sad. I think Santa Claus is real.

---

## JIM:
What?

---

## WENDY:
In a way.

---

## ANN:
Do you mean that there is a word, Santa Claus, an idea Santa Claus, that is real, so therefore, Santa Claus is real?

---

## MICHAEL:
That’s like saying unicorns are real because there is a word and a mental picture for them.

---

## ANN:
That’s an old problem in linguistics—

---

## WENDY:
I wasn’t really thinking of linguistics, I mean that during Christmas time

---

—we choose to give —so the spirit of Santa Claus—exists.

---

## MICHAEL:
That’s very “yes Virginia there is a Santa Claus” of you.

---

## ANN:
I suppose, in that sense, Santa Claus-ing, the action of being Santa Claus, exists,

---


it just doesn’t match the picture of a unified Santa Claus.

---

## WENDY:
I’m not sure what you just said, Ann. But I think that when we pray we make God happen.

---

Do any of you pray?

---

None of you? Mike?

---

## MICHAEL:
Sort of. Not really. I believe in a higher power

---

but I can’t tell if it’s God on my shoulder or Mom and Dad.

---

## WENDY:
John?

---

## JOHN:
I have conversations with God, I don’t know if I’d call it praying.

---

I remember walking around campus in the winter of my junior year

---

with the Jesuits and I wrote down everything I thought I’d ever done wrong in my life

---

and then I tore up the pieces of paper as small as I could

---

so no one would ever recognize the handwriting and threw them into the wind and I said: 

---

No more, No more guilt.

---

## MICHAEL:
I never knew that.

---

## JOHN:
Yeah, well.

---

## JIM:
That’s deep.

---

## JOHN:
All right, shut up. What about you? You must have prayed when you were a quarterback.

---

---

## JOHN:
I prayed so much as a young soldier of Christ it lost all meaning.

---

Annie I couldn’t believe it when you broke into the Our Father when we were holding vigil over Dad.

---


 
Okay, he was “our father” and it was an appropriate choice,

---

but you’ve been railing for decades against the bullshit in the Catholic Church.

---


 
Maybe you haven’t strayed so far from the flock.

---

## ANN:

I still take communion to be sociable . I do miss it, the affiliation but—

---

## JIM:
But—

---

## ANN:
I just can’t —I don’t have an explanation for the world . I don’t have an explanation for what happens after death.

---

## WENDY:
Doesn’t that make you afraid of dying?

---

## ANN:
Yes. Of course I’m afraid of dying. It’s organized my entire life.

---

Aren’t you afraid of dying?

---

## WENDY:
No. I think it’s like changing clothes. I think the moment will be beautiful.

---

Liberating. I think I’ve done it before. I think I’ve had lots of lives.

---

## ANN:
Oh

---

## MICHAEL:
Hm.

---

## ANN:
I wish I could believe that. It sounds nice.

---

## MICHAEL:
Annie, I wish I could prove to you that consciousness persists. I think you’d be less afraid.

---

## ANN:
How could you?

---

## MICHAEL:
Dad—if you’re here with us, give us a sign.

---

---

## ANN:
Oh my God—

---

## JOHN:
Holy shit!

---

## WENDY:
I told you!

---

## JOHN:
Well, I have no fear of death. I spend no time thinking of it. If there’s life after death, wonderful.

---

If there isn’t, what’s the point of worrying. Can’t do anything about it.

---

## JIM:
You don’t think you’re in denial?

---

## JOHN:
No. Life is for the living.

---

## WENDY:
That’s what Mom always said.

---

## MICHAEL:
Well, I’m afraid of dying. I think there’s a scientific part of me that wonders: What is it like to die?

---

And I sort of assume my mind would survive that experience.

---

I’m going to miss a whole lot of people. I think the scary thing is not knowing if they’re going to miss me.

---


I remember when we had to put down Capp, I thought: What is the meaning of the life of a dog?

---

I hope when I die people remember me more than they would remember the family dog . . .

---

on the other hand it’s not a competition so if they want to remember Capp more than me that’s fine too . . .

---

## ANN:
I guess I live so much in my own consciousness that the idea of not being here—of that ceasing . . . is terrible . . . Then I apply logic and say: but I won’t know—so . . .

---

But I would like my consciousness to persist so, I can see my grandchildren grow up.

---

I’d like to see their graduations, their . . .

---

## JOHN:
Of course.

---

## ANN:
. . . growing up.

---

## JIM:
But what does it mean to be a grown-up?

---

## MICHAEL:
All I know is my mantra used to be: immortality through immaturity!

---

## JIM:
 
Do you feel like a grown-up, Annie?

---

## ANN:

No. When I think of grown-ups I think of Dad wearing that hat—

---

a grown-up man’s hat—to work every day— not because it kept you warm but because that’s what grown-ups did.

---


 
I pride myself somehow on —not feeling grown up.

---

## JOHN:
So, you only have bad associations with growing up—“

---

## ANN:
Growing up means—planning. Even though I like plans and lists I’ve never had A Plan.

---

## JOHN:
Well by that definition isn’t being a grown-up a good thing? Someone who plans?

---

## ANN:
Maybe. I can’t seem to shake the disappointment that I haven’t—done something— whatever that would be . 

---

Dad always said: “I never praised you kids because I didn’t want you to get swelled heads.”

---

## JOHN:
He was not free with the compliments. It was always:

---

## JOHN, JIM & MICHAEL:
“He who flatters me does me an injustice.”

---

## ANN:
One time Dad said to me driving home from an Iowa football game:

---

“Well you’re very smart, Annie. ” But it made me feel like he was saying: 

---

“You’re smart so why have you not accomplished anything?”

---

## WENDY:
Geez.

---

## JOHN:
Of course Dad was proud of you.

---

## ANN:
He used to say, “You’re so smart, Annie, you shouldn’t be a teacher. You could have been a lawyer.”

---

## JIM:
Well, yeah . . .

---

## ANN:

And that’s what I associate with being grown up —programmed—ossified—

---

I remember my deep almost primitive hatred of Nixon and wondering if it wasn’t somehow to do with Dad . . .

---

## JOHN:
Do you remember having to be in the children’s brigade for Nixon?

---

## ANN:
I was out of the house by then, thank God—

---

## JIM:
Kennedy came through town that election cycle and was motorcading on River Drive.

---


 
I was holding a Nixon sign assuring balance to the proceedings.

---

He came by in an open convertible, in the back seat, just like in Dallas.

---

Everyone cheering. My eyes zeroed in on him and I started running after the motorcade. He was the enemy in my mind,

---

just as the Ohio State football team was the enemy of the Hawkeyes, my team.

---

I was madly yelling obscenities and booing him; but all the while I had him in my eye and couldn’t stop thinking how cool he was

---

and wondering why in the hell I was doing what I was doing.

---

And secretly inside I joined the cheering. How could I not . . .

---

## MICHAEL:
I wonder if the whole country grew up after JFK was shot.

---

## JOHN:
Either that or the whole country decided never to grow up after JFK was shot.

---

## ANN:
Do you feel like a grown-up?

---

## JOHN:
Yeah and I’m tired of it.

---

## ANN:
When did you feel like a grown-up?

---

## JOHN:
When I got a seat at the big table.

---

## ANN:
What?

---

## JOHN:
You know the big dining room table rather than the little kid card table at holidays?

---

## ANN:
Wow that’s so literal. Michael?

---

## MICHAEL:
As the fourth of five I had the luxury of never having to grow up;

---

I was always little Mikey as soon as I crossed the threshold. I defer to everyone, I don’t know why Wendy doesn’t defer to me.

---

No, but seriously I think I grew up during my medical training.

---

When they first called a code I would run in the other direction but by the end of my residency I ran toward the code. 

---

And that felt sort of grown up.

---

## ANN:
Wendy?

---

## WENDY:
As a child I thought growing up was getting married, and I never wanted to do that

---

because married people looked so bored with each other and I never wanted to be like that. 

---

I wanted to run into fountains with my clothes on.

---

## ANN:
And when you got married?

---

## WENDY:
Yes—but not overnight— it was finding a livelihood where I could help other people. It was learning to get out of the way.

---

## JIM:
So you’re the only one who doesn’t feel like a grown-up?

---

## ANN:
I guess.

---

## JIM:
Well, if you don’t grow up you don’t have to die. Here’s to not to not growing up.

---

## MICHAEL:
You can grow up before you die or not grow up before you die,

---
 
but either way you’re going to die. Give me some of that.

---

## ANN:
And dying is such a failure.

---

## JIM:
How do you mean?

---

## ANN:
Our bodies are the enemy and dying is a capitulation to a foreign shore.

---

## JIM:
Do you experience your body as the enemy?

---

## ANN:
Don’t you?

---

## JIM:
: No.

---

## ANN:
You cut cancer out of people’s bodies. Aren’t you sort of the hero and the body is this enemy?

---

## JIM:
Cancer is the enemy. You’re marshaling the body’s resources. The body is your closest ally.

---

## JOHN:
Like Canada?

## ALL:

## ANN:
I’d like it if Canada were Heaven— I’d go to the Shaw festival—

## JIM:
I remember once driving into Manhattan on an August Sunday to see a patient.

---

The day was hot as hell, nobody on the street. It was so still, like everyone was at a party elsewhere

---

and I was the only one not invited. I thought: Is this what death is like? Awful.

---

## ANN:
It’s funny, I think I believe in Tinker Bell more than I do in the afterlife.

---
 
I stopped believing in God when I noticed that all the myths were the same—

---

I was teaching the myth of Prometheus and suddenly I thought—Prometheus—oh! He’s just like Jesus!

---

And I thought about Greek myths and how silly they seem to us now

---

and how our myths will seem just as silly to those who come after us—

---

## WENDY:
But if they’re all the same metaphor I mean doesn’t that prove something?

---

## ANN:
Hmm.

---

## MICHAEL:
A good Catholic doesn’t think God is a metaphor. When the little bell rings it’s real.

---

## JOHN:
I should know, I was an altar boy. I rang that bell.

---

## ANN:
Like Tinker Bell.

---

class: center, middle
[a tinkling sound]

## JOHN:
Well I think it’s all a metaphor.

## WENDY:
But metaphors are real that’s what I’m trying to say—

---

## ANN:
Anyway, isn’t it weird that I religiously believe fairies onstage are real; it isn’t a very useful belief . . .

---

but I don’t believe in an afterlife even though it could be a useful belief.

---

## JOHN:
But you can’t just choose your whole belief system based on usefulness, can you?

---

## JIM:
There are consequences to having a false belief.

---

## ANN:
Well sure—

---

## JOHN:
Take this country for example.

---

## WENDY:
No thanks.

---

## JOHN:
We’ve confused self-interest with selfishness.

---

## MICHAEL:
We have! No one really understands anything about economics; of course I understand everything about economics . . .

---

## JIM:
You know what’s really wrong with this country?

---



Too many crazed and half-witted Platonists and too few sensible Aristotelians

---

who want to roll up their sleeves and get things done.

---

## ANN:
I suppose you think liberals are the crazed, half-witted Platonists?

---

## JIM:
I don’t even know if Plato was a Platonist . . . .

---

## MICHAEL:
Now you’ve lost me.

---

## JIM:
Plato goes like this

---

and Aristotle goes like that.

---

Liberals believe in unreal worlds— Neverland if you will—

---

and conservatives are pragmatists who try to solve problems on the ground.

---

## ANN:
Newt Gingrich being a paragon of practical wisdom?

---

## WENDY:
Do we have to fight about politics tonight?

---

## JIM:
Dad would have approved.

---

## MICHAEL:
Then let’s fight!

---

## JOHN:
You know what Dad used to say— if you’re not a liberal before the age of twenty you have no heart

---

and if you’re not conservative after the age of forty you have no brain—

---

## ANN:
The idea of conservatives being the grown-up party is absurd—

---

the party of Lincoln used to be pragmatic, now you’re all insane—

---

## JOHN:
How would you know, you don’t read conservative papers,

---

we read the New York Times every day but when’s the last time you’ve picked up a conservative paper—

---

or read William Safire— or Ann Coulter—

---

## ANN:
AHHHHHHH!

---

## JOHN:
Oh ho!

---

## ANN:
I wouldn’t dream of reading Ann Coulter— she’s an idiot witch—

---

## MICHAEL:
How do you know if she’s an idiot if you don’t read her—

---

## JIM:
She’s not exactly my first choice, but if she were liberal you would say she was a sassy Joan of Arc—

---

## ANN:
Don’t you dare insult Joan of Arc—

---

## JIM:
Oh I forgot you played her in college—

---

## MICHAEL:
I read Nicholas Kristof even though I don’t agree.

---

## ANN:
Good for you.

---

## JOHN:
He advocates socialism—

---

## ANN:
What???!

---

## JOHN:
Is a businessman really worth a billion dollars? No. But the gross redistribution of income makes no sense either.

---

## ANN:
What are you talking about?

---

## JOHN:
We’ve incentivized the wrong behavior

---

## ANN:
The welfare state is gone. Bill Clinton just dismantled it.

---

## JOHN:
The welfare state is far from gone! It is alive and well and ever-expanding!

---

## ANN:
Dad lived through the Depression. He ate squirrels. He shot squirrels and ate them because he was hungry.

---

Why was he so undone by the concept of the have-nots being helped?

---

## MICHAEL:
Dad did pro bono work all the time and never asked for recognition—

---

## JIM:
Dad grew up dirt poor. His father was educated, was even a lawyer,

---

but he was a small-town lawyer in a town that was too small to need one.

---

## ANN:

Exactly— how can people who have struggled so much in the past lose all empathy for people who struggle in the present?

---

## JIM:
Let me finish. Dad didn’t even have a bathroom in his house.

---

When he moved into a house with five functioning toilets—

---

## JOHN:
functioning—

---

## JIM:
—almost, can you imagine how flushed (sorry) he felt with success?

---

He went to a subsidized state university on the GI Bill—

---

## ANN:
Exactly my point—

---

## JIM:
—but it wasn’t enough. He waited on tables at the student union. He met Mom because he waited on her.

---

## ALL:

Made her a hamburger in the shape of a heart. Poured on ketchup for blood.

---

## JOHN:
He won her over! In his mind he pulled himself out of the prairie, out of the Depression, out of the outhouse— into our house.

---

He became somebody, he became a contender. He works his ass off to send us to good schools
 
and we come back espousing views that undermine his life narrative.

---

So he flicks the channel and watches another episode of Archie Bunker. It is his refuge, his post-Depression, post-outhouse refuge,
 
how can we deny him that? How can we say he is wrong?

---

## MICHAEL:
Hear, hear!

---

## ANN:
Why are you so angry?

---

## JIM:
I’m not angry.

---

## JOHN:
Look, Dad hated that the whole idea of the family was being eroded. He cared about—you know—family values.

---

## ANN:
 
Christ . . .

---

## JOHN:
Now, I come from this old-fashioned unit called the family, thank God, and it’s a tragedy that fifty percent of this country doesn’t have one!

---

## ANN:
Where do you get your figures?

---

## JOHN:
The government can’t do the same job raising a family—

---

## ANN:
So the subtext is—

---

## JOHN:
There’s no subtext—

---

## ANN:
Come on that’s code for—

## JOHN:
I’m from the Midwest, I don’t speak in codes, I say what I mean—

## JOHN:
No!

## JOHN:

## ANN:
They are personal—

---

## MICHAEL:
We’re just talking about ideas— it’s all in good fun—

---

## ANN:
Well it’s not fun for me—

---

## JOHN:
And I would never say that about single mothers, you’ve been a single mother since Pat died, 

---

and you’ve done a beautiful job with your girls and you sure as hell deserve praise.

---

## ANN:
Well thank you.

---

## JOHN:
You’re welcome.

---

## ANN:

It’s just that if this family, who loves each other about as much as a family can,

---

can’t talk about politics in a civilized fashion, how do you expect the rest of the country to talk to each other at all?

---

## MICHAEL:
I think this is a very civilized conversation—

---

## WENDY:
This is not civilized! You’ve all had too much to drink— and—no one listens anymore—

---

## JOHN:
I’m listening! My hearing is just going!

---

## ANN:

Political arguments are a sport for you boys and it’s not a sport for us—

---

everyone yells and interrupts on the talk shows so now we all yell and interrupt, it’s awful—

## MICHAEL:

No one was yelling! AHHHHHH! That’s yelling.

---

ANNWhen did you all go to the dark side? Was it under Reagan? You all sound like Aunt Helen!

We should be an example of a functional democracy!

## WENDY:
This is not a functional democracy. And I am sick of pretending that it is!

---

I used to feel bad for Mom cleaning all the time while the men talked politics—now I understand.

---


 
She just wanted everyone to shut the hell up— so she could hear herself think!

---

She could think better over the sink with the water running! It’s all noise! Static.
 
And I’m so goddamn tired of it!

---

We’re on a sinking ship, and you’re fighting over the precise location of the deck chairs.

---

The ocean is rising, the world is falling apart, and it’s all bullshit—

---

My God! We’re orphans now!

---

## ANN:
And for a moment I was transported back to the teeny breakfast nook at 111 McClellan.

---

Mom and Dad still alive.

---

All of us around the wooden table, arguing about politics. Mom was bustling around the kitchen, the smell of bacon,

---

Dad was putting NutraSweet on his grapefruit.

---
 
Mom was on her eighth cigarette and eighteenth cup of coffee since five in the morning,

---
 
she was smoking and needlepointing a pillow that said “The Best Is Yet to Come.”

---

Two radios are on and two televisions, one with a football game and one with Crossfire.
 
---

We’ve been having the same political argument for the past thirty years—

---

the lamp over the table was the same— but now there are no parents to adjudicate.

We’re supposed to be the grown-ups now. We slept in our childhood beds that night.

## PETER PAN:
I know how to sew.

---

## WENDY:
So do I. Mom taught me.

---

PETER PAN   No, Mom taught me.

---

## WENDY:
Mom taught me. You’re Peter Pan. You don’t have a mother. And you don’t know how to sew.

---

## PETER PAN:
Right, I’m Peter Pan.

---

## WENDY:
I’ve been sending you letters, you know.

---

## PETER PAN:
We can’t get letters in Neverland, Wendy. I don’t have an address!

---

## WENDY:
Now, Peter! I can’t sew your shadow on while you’re crowing.

---

## WENDY:
Nana! Give me that medicine. It’s for Michael. Here Michael, take your medicine.

---

## MICHAEL:
I won’t take it, I won’t!

---

## WENDY:
Now, Michael, you must take your medicine. Father says so.

---

## MICHAEL:
I’m a doctor, I don’t take medicine.

---

## WENDY:
Now, Peter, sit still, stop trying to touch your shadow. Sit still and I’ll do it.

---

## WENDY:
Everything has a shadow, Peter Pan.

---

Honestly you should have gone to Jungian analysis. You would have learned that you can’t experience joy without your dark side.

---

## PETER PAN:
I don’t know what you just said, Wendy.

---

## WENDY:
You can live on Freud until you’re forty but when you’re seventy and facing death you either need religion or Carl Jung.

---

## PETER PAN:
Why can’t I fly without my shadow?

---

## JOHN:
Think about it, Peter.

---

PETER PAN  What?

---

## JOHN:
A plane that’s flying without its shadow on the ground is—

---

## PETER PAN:
Is what—

---

class: center, middle
[Boom]

---

## JOHN:
Poof—dead!

---

## PETER PAN:
Or just flying at night!

---

## WENDY:
I’ve sewn it on, Peter.

---

## PETER PAN:
Oh, well done! It’s on again, my shadow is on again!

---

## PETER PAN:
Now I can fly!

---

## JOHN:
That was the worst flying I ever saw, Peter.

---

## PETER PAN:
Sorry.I’m afraid—

---

## MICHAEL:
What—you afraid, Peter Pan?

---

## PETER PAN:
I’m not afraid. My foot hurts.

---

## JOHN:
Then I’ll fly.

---

## JOHN:
Ouch.

---

## MICHAEL:
I’ll do it.

---

## JOHN:
Oh. We’re old, aren’t we? We’re getting too old to fly?

---

## MICHAEL:
One of my best friends just died.

---

## WENDY:
Me too.

---

## MICHAEL:
And I had to treat him.

---

## JOHN:
They’re all getting old and dying. It’s awful.

---

## PETER PAN:
No! Keep a positive attitude. We’ll walk to Neverland. Except my foot is killing me.

---

Could someone grab me a cane? How far a walk is Neverland?

---

## WENDY:
Why Peter, you can’t walk there!

---

## PETER PAN:
Right. Come! Just think wonderful thoughts and they’ll lift you up into the air!

---

## PETER PAN:
March!

---

ALL: ♪ “Oh when the saints, oh when the saints, oh when the saints go marching in ♪ . . . .”

## JOHN:
It’s Neverland!

---

## MICHAEL AND WENDY:
Neverland!

---

## JOHN:
There’s the volcano!

---

## MICHAEL:
There’s the Jolly Roger!

---

## WENDY:
It’s so beautiful!

---

## PETER PAN:
Sometimes I get panic attacks when I first get to Neverland. Don’t worry, it’s nothing.

---
 
Just, I hate travel. Airports, train stations, flying . . .

---

## WENDY:
Breathe, Peter, deep breaths.

---

## PETER PAN:
Maybe we shouldn’t have come.

---

## JOHN:
The sun is out. Let’s play shadow tag. Peter, you’re it.

---

## PETER PAN:
Gotcha, you’re it Michael!

---

## MICHAEL:
Run, run, I’m it!

---

## JOHN:
Look at my top hat in the shadow!

---

## WENDY:
I’m standing on your head.

---

## JOHN:
Get off of my head.

---

## WENDY:
My shadow is so short!“

---

## JOHN:
My shadow is so long! My shadow is longer than your shadow!

---

## MICHAEL:
Is not!

---

## JOHN:
Is too!

---

## WENDY:
I didn’t know it was a competition!

---

## PETER PAN:
When I turn around my shadow turns with me!.

---

## PETER PAN:
Oh—dizzy—

---

## ALL:
Oh . . .

---

## PETER PAN:
I can’t see anyone’s shadow!

---

## WENDY:
It’s because of the clouds!

---

## PETER PAN:
Well we can’t play if we can’t see each other’s shadows. Anyway, my foot hurts.

---

## MICHAEL:
Let me look at it.

---

## PETER PAN:
It’s not the diabetes, it’s the gout.

---

## MICHAEL:
When you first feel a twinge, you have to take an anti-inflammatory. You have to stay ahead of the pain.

---

## PETER PAN:
I don’t like taking ibuprofen, it causes bleeds.


## JOHN:
Where is Hook? I’ll fight him! I’d love to kill a pirate! Ha! Ha!

---

## MICHAEL:
Where are the lost boys?

---

## JOHN:
We are the lost boys.

---

## PETER PAN:
Wendy, you don’t know how lucky you are to have had a mother.

---

## WENDY:
I miss her!

---

## PETER PAN:
Oh, don’t cry, Wendy! I can’t stand it when you cry!

---

## MICHAEL:
I don’t want to grow up.

---

## JOHN:
I don’t want to grow up either!

---

## WENDY:
I want my mother! I want my father!

---

## MICHAEL:
Me Too!

---

## JOHN:
Me too!

---

JOHN, MICHAEL, AND WENDY: We don’t want to grow up!

PETER PAN I can’t stand it! Tinker Bell!

How can you be the oldest, Peter, if you don’t grow up?

I’m the oldest because I am the oldest.

## JIM as HOOK:
Ah, if it isn’t Peter Pan!

---

## PETER PAN:
In the flesh, Hook! Ticktock ticktock where’s your arm, Hook?

---

## HOOK:
Heard a rumor you walked here, Pan. Why didn’t you fly?

---

## PETER PAN:
You must be mistaken. I flew.

---

## HOOK:
No, Peter Pan. You thought you’d never grow up. But you have.

---

You walked here. Slowly. Are you ready to face me?

---

## WENDY:
You big bully!

---

## HOOK:
Time for you to walk the plank little girl.

---

## PETER PAN:
You won’t kill my sister! Everyone, it’s time to kill Captain Hook.

Hook is death! Kill death! Make death die!

And Dad sold the house.

He sold the house?

He died. And we sold it. We all sold the house.

We could at least look through the windows!

Oh yes yes! Let’s!

Can we get in through the windows?

## JOHN:
No. The house isn’t ours anymore.

.WENDY:  Then where will we go?

---

## JOHN:
Back to our grown-up lives, I suppose.

## PETER PAN:
No, no!

---

## WENDY:
We must, Peter. I just remembered that I have a job. With people who are sad, who need me.

---

And also, my husband— my two kids— they need me too—

---

## PETER PAN:
leave, Wendy!

---

## WENDY:

I must, Peter.

---

## JIM:
I have to go cut cancer out of people’s bodies. Also, I have two grandchildren who I like to hold. I need to go.

---

## JOHN:
I have my students. My kids. I need to see my wife. We want to grow old together.

---

## PETER PAN:
No, don’t leave!

---

## MICHAEL:
I have my patients, my wife, my children. Peter Pan, we can’t stay. .

---

## PETER PAN:
When will I see you? Don’t go, don’t go! Oh Wendy!

---

## WENDY:
Spring cleaning, Peter Pan! I’ll come back for spring cleaning!

---

## PETER PAN:
Ugh. Grown-ups. Spring cleaning. I want to keep flying!

---

## PETER PAN:

There’s the Davenport Children’s Theatre! There’s the balcony! There’s Mr. Smee! Bump Heeter . My God, Mary Ellen Hurlbutt—she looks so pretty! And in the audience, Mary Fluhrer Nighswander! And all the men in the lobby are wearing hats!

---

## PETER PAN:
I think I see my father in the audience.] I take a bow.

---

## PETER PAN:
Thanks, Dad. Did you grow these yourself?

---

## GEORGE:
Yep. You looked great up there.

---

How ’bout my little girl flying?

---

Now let’s go back to 111. There’s a little party for you. Mother made Chex party mix.

---

You can change out of those green tights and come home.

---

## PETER PAN:
I can go home?

---

## GEORGE:
Whaddya mean, of course you can.

---

It’s your last Christmas before you go out east to college.

---

We’re all going to miss you. But it’s going to be an awfully big adventure.

---

## PETER PAN:
Do you think so?

---

## GEORGE:
I know so.

---

## PETER PAN:
I’m suddenly afraid. Did you die? What was it like?

---

Your breathing was terrible. It seemed like you didn’t want to go. Was it awful?

---

## GEORGE:
Come on now, change your costume.

---

## PETER PAN:
I don’t want to change costumes.

---

## GEORGE:
Those green tights can’t be too comfortable after a while. Mother’s waiting at home.

---

## PETER PAN:
Will you come with me?

---

## GEORGE:
They don’t want a father in the dressing room.

---

## PETER PAN:
No, I mean will you come with me?

---

## GEORGE:
Course I will. I’ve been here all along.

---

## PETER PAN:
Oh, good! Will you hold my flowers while I change?

---

And my photograph with Mary Martin? It’s my good luck charm.

---

## GEORGE:
I’m very proud of you, Annie.

---

## PETER PAN:
Thanks, Dad.

---

## GEORGE:
All right.

---
---

EPILOGUE

---
---

## PETER PAN:
And I went up to my dressing room while he waited. I took off my green tights.

---

But before I went home, I stayed in the theater for a little while longer.

---

Where you don’t have to grow up.
