And they had already done their little - well not little, these guys were actually - I notice some people don't watch, on principle, they bury their heads in their books or their phones, but I always feel like they're kids, and I'm sorry, I can't stand on my hands while the subway car is moving, so I admit it, I'm impressed -

### Page 11 → ~Lines 362-372 (MJ "I feel pretty okay")

**Should be (one speech):**
> When Alex was born a friend of mine, she's since moved to San Diego, her father was – anyway she had been through a lot of stuff, and when Alex was born, she said to me, "Mary Jane, you'll still have good days and bad days."

> That was the one move my baby and not tell me!

**Should be:**
