  DIAL M FOR MURDER
]<br>
Written by FREDERICK KNOTT<br>
Adapted by JEFFREY HATCHER

---

[Music]

---

## MARGOT
So. How would you murder me?

---

## MAXINE
How would you like to be murdered?

---

## MARGOT
What are my choices?

---

## MAXINE
Oh, there are so many methods to choose from. 

---

Alphabetically there’s asphyxiation, blade, bullet, bludgeon…

---

## MARGOT
Blow to the head?

---

## MAXINE
Same as bludgeon really.

---

## MARGOT
Sorry.

---

## MAXINE
Drowning. Electrocution. Garroting. Hanging. Poison. Strangling.

---

## MARGOT
Isn’t strangling the same as garroting?

---

## MAXINE
Garroting is a subcategory of strangling.

## MARGOT
I see.

---

## MAXINE
Truth be told, they’re both subcategories of asphyxiation.

---

## MARGOT
God is in the details. Go on.

---

## MAXINE
Shoot. Stab. Erm…

---

## MARGOT
You’re up to T.

---

## MAXINE
Tickle to death?

---

## MARGOT
It’s been tried.

---

## MAXINE
Yes, I know, you’re immune.

---

## MARGOT
You’re disturbingly good at this.

---

## MAXINE
It’s all I’ve thought about for the past year.

---

## MARGOT
Murder?

---

## MAXINE
Means, motives, killer and killed.

---

## MARGOT
It would defeat me. Having to come up with the motive alone. I mean, how many motives are there, really?

---

## MAXINE
Five.

---

## MARGOT
Five?

---

## MAXINE
Five for murder, yes.

---

## MARGOT
I’ll bet I can guess them.

---

## MAXINE
Go on.

---

## MARGOT
Money. Fear. Jealousy. Revenge. ...Uhm... five you said?

---

## MAXINE
I did, yes.

---

## MARGOT
I give up.

---

## MAXINE
Protecting someone you love. 

---

Was it all right, my dropping by? I mean, we had said we’d meet at the theater, the three of us.

---

## MARGOT
No, this is better, seeing you without Tony.

---

## MAXINE
Why?

---

## MARGOT
There’s something I wanted to tell you. When Tony let me know you were coming to London about your book, I knew I couldn’t put it off any longer.

---

## MAXINE
Better top this off then.

---

## MARGOT
After you went back to New York last year and wrote to me, 

---

I burned all your letters. All except one. You probably know the one I mean.

---

## MAXINE
I think I can guess.

---

## MARGOT
I carried it wherever I went. Then one weekend Tony and I were going away. 

---

We were at Victoria Station. The letter was in my handbag. 

---

But that day, I set my bag down to pay for something and when I turned back it was gone.

---

## MAXINE
Did you get it back?

---

## MARGOT
We reported it, and a week later the bag showed up in the lost and found. 

---

But the letter wasn't in it. A few days later I got this.

---

---

## MAXINE
“Am in possession of a letter belonging to you. If you wish its return, 

---

place 5,000 pounds in a package and leave it for John S. King 23 Newport Street, SW7.” 

---

Done in block capital letters. Anyone could have written this. What did you do?

---

## MARGOT
Nothing.

---

## MAXINE
Didn’t you want it back? 5000 pounds couldn’t have made much of a difference to you.

---

## MARGOT
Of course I wanted it back. But I was terrified to make a move. 

---

Then I received a second note.

---

## MAXINE
"If you do not deliver 5,000 pounds to John S. King at 23 Newport Street by this Friday, the letter will be given to your husband."

---

## MARGOT
So I took 5,000 pounds out of the bank, put it in a parcel and left it at 23 Newport Street.

---

It’s a little shop people use as a forwarding address.

---

## MAXINE
And then?

---

## MARGOT
Then I waited for the letter to be returned, but… Nothing came. 

---

After a week, I went back. They said a messenger had picked up the parcel.

---

## MAXINE
You never heard from the blackmailer again?

## MARGOT
No.

---

## MAXINE
Is that why you told me to stop writing?

---

## MARGOT
I imagined any letter you wrote to me being stolen and read.

---

## MAXINE
May I hold on to these for a while?

---

## MARGOT
If you like.

---

## MAXINE
You never told Tony?

---

## MARGOT
No, and I never will. 

---

That night I went to your flat to say good-bye, Tony was driving to Oxford for the weekend. 

---

When I came back here, I collapsed onto that sofa and cried for hours. 

---

Eventually I fell asleep. Then I woke, and Tony was standing there, looking down on me.

---

He said he’d got halfway to Oxford when suddenly he knew that he had to give up writing and take that job at your publishers.

---

## MAXINE
Yes, he called me next morning and said the same thing. Public relations. I hear he’s very good at it.

---

## MARGOT
It’s his great talent, charming people.

---

## MAXINE
Did he say why he was giving up on his writing?

---

## MARGOT
He said he wanted to become the husband I deserved.

---

## MAXINE
And has he been?

---

## MARGOT
I think he believes he’s tried.

---

## MAXINE
And that’s good enough for you? 

---

---

That night. A year ago. I’m standing there in that closet called a flat, slicing button mushrooms for the spaghetti, thinking:

---

"I’m going to make Margot tell Tony everything, have it out with him."

---

## MARGOT
You know it never could have worked.

---

## MAXINE
It?

---

## MARGOT
We. Us.

---

## MAXINE
Because?

## MARGOT
Because it couldn’t! It..! I’ve told you about my aunt.

---

## MAXINE
Your aunt who never married and left you everything.

---

## MARGOT
She knew me very well. When Tony proposed and I was on the fence about saying “yes,” she was quite clear about what I should do.

---

## MAXINE
Did she think marriage would make you happy?

---

## MARGOT
Happier than she’d been.

---

## MAXINE
So to please your rich, unmarried, unhappy aunt who was, in every way but her predilections, boringly conventional and afraid of scandal, 

---

you married Tony, the consequence of which is that you are as unhappy as she was, only for different reasons.

---

At least you got her money when she died.

---

Why didn’t you tell me about these blackmail notes when you got them?

---

## MARGOT
I don’t know. I was confused. And I.. I thought it might have been you.

---

## MAXINE
You thought I sent you these blackmail notes?

---

## MARGOT
You were so angry with me, flying back to New York like that!

---

## MAXINE
Yes, flying to New York, writing you letters every day, until you told me to stop.

---

I couldn’t stay here in London knowing you were trying make a go of it with Tony. 

---

Do you know how I spent the past year? 

---

I got the cheapest apartment I could find, a sixth floor walk-up in Greenwich Village, and I typed.

---

Rather I smoked and typed. Rather I smoked and drank a half bottle of whiskey a day and typed,

---

but the whiskey was only at the end of the day, it was the reward for my work.

---

If I wrote a thousand words, I could have a drink, then fall into bed, exhausted. 

---

I thought, if I don’t finish this book, what was it all for, all the mess and roiling passions? 

---

So I smoked and I typed and I finished it. That’s how I spent the last year since you broke things off. 

---

That’s how I filled my days. And how do you fill yours?

---

## MARGOT
I keep house, I volunteer. At the museum.

---

## MAXINE
Which? London has so many.

---

## MARGOT
The British Museum and the National and the Tate and the Portrait Gallery. 

---

I’m part of a group that goes into the East End to see to women who don’t have it as good as.. 

---

I’m mad for the theater, evenings and matinees, you’ll always find me there, sixth row center. 

---

I’ve taken up Indonesian cooking. I gave up smoking. And there’s Tony.

---

## MAXINE
And does that fill your days?

---

## MARGOT
Not one bit.

---

---

[Door Slams]

## MAXINE
There’s the boy!

---

## MARGOT
Tony, where have you been?

---

## TONY
Sorry, darlings, an emergency blew up just as I was trying to leave.

---

## MAXINE
Aren’t you going to kiss me?

---

## TONY
I was observing the formalities: first the wife, then the lover.

---

## MAXINE
You and I were never lovers.

---

## TONY
Quite right, a dozen dinner dates does not a lover make.

---

So, what have you two been conspiring about? “Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous”?

---

## MARGOT
Don’t fix yourself a drink, you’ve no time. The play starts in less than –

---

## TONY
Yes, I know, and.. I can’t go.

---

## MARGOT
What?

---

## MAXINE
But the play’s a murder mystery, and it’s supposed to be dreadful, we’ll have such a good time.

---

## TONY
I know, and I’m sorry, but I’ve got to revise the jacket copy for your book.

---

## MAXINE
I thought that had been done months ago.

---

## TONY
It was, but the boss says it needs to be completely re-done. It’s got to be ready first thing tomorrow, so I’ve no choice.

---

## MAXINE
Can’t you dash off something in the morning?

---

## TONY
In the morning, you and I have breakfast with the editor of the Times Sunday Supplement, then a meeting about the cover art. 

---

I told them you hate the colors, lurid you called them.

---

## MAXINE
Not lurid enough.

---

## TONY
They’re showing you some new ideas based on the same look.

---

## MAXINE
Woman, corpse, blood?

---

## TONY
It’s what sells.

---

## MARGOT
Lovely.

## MAXINE
When’s the BBC interview?

---

## TONY
Tomorrow evening at eight o’clock. Very good time slot. 

---

You’ll be listened to by every wife, widow and pensioner in the country.

---

## MAXINE
My readership.

---

## TONY
And we’re having supper after.

---

## MARGOT
Where would you like to go?

---

## MAXINE
Where would you like to go?

---

## TONY
Uhm, darling? Pottifer is joining us for dinner tomorrow night.

---

## MARGOT
Oh, Lord.

---

## MAXINE
Who’s Pottifer?

---

## TONY
The BBC talks director. Dinner with him is the price of that awfully good time slot.

---

I know you loathe him, so I explained you were otherwise engaged.

---

## MARGOT
Ah. Well. Thanks for getting me off the hook. I will now spend a lonely evening at home. 

---

So I won’t see you at all tomorrow?

---

## TONY
The studios are just across the park. We’ll all have a drink here before we go. That all right, Maxine?

---

## MAXINE
Sure, I’m easy.

---

## TONY
Oh. I’d better call and get you a taxi.

---

## MARGOT
Don’t bother. We can pick one up at the corner.

---

## TONY
All right, but you’d better go now then.

---

## MAXINE
Come on, let’s make a run for it.

---

## MARGOT
What do you want us to do with your ticket, try to give it away?

---

## TONY
Sell it, have a drink on the proceeds.

---

## MAXINE
Should be good for two drinks. Margot. Your handbag.

---

---

## Tony
Bye, Dear

---

---

[Music]

---

[Front door buzzer]

---

## LESGATE
Mr. Fisher?

## TONY
Stephen Fisher, yes. 

---

## Tony
Captain Lesgate?

## LESGATE
Yes.

---

## TONY
Do come in.

---

## LESGATE
I’m a tad early. Hope you don’t mind.

---

## TONY
No, no, not at all, keep me on my toes. Did you have any difficulty finding your way?

---

## LESGATE
None at all.

---

## TONY
Drink?

---

## LESGATE
Love one. By the way, how did you know my car was for sale?

---

## TONY
Your garage told me. I stopped for a fill-up and saw it on the blocks.

---

I said I was looking for something like it, and they gave me your phone number. It is still for sale, I hope.

---

## LESGATE
If you’ve got eleven hundred pounds.

---

## TONY
I refuse to discuss the price until you've had at least three brandies.

---

## LESGATE
I warn you, I drive a hard bargain, drunk or sober. 

---

I can't help thinking I've seen you before somewhere.

---

## TONY
Funny you should say that. The moment I opened the door I... 

---

Wait a minute. Lesgate? No. Not Lesgate. Swann! C.J. Swann. Or was it C. A.?

---

## LESGATE
..C. A.

---

## TONY
You were at Cambridge. Must be twenty years ago. You wouldn't remember me. I think you only came my last year.

---

## LESGATE
Yes, of course. But I don’t recall anyone named Fisher.

---

## TONY
That’s because my name’s not Fisher. It’s Wendice.

---

## LESGATE
That’s right, Tony Wendice. So what's all this about “Fisher?”

---

## TONY
What's all this about “Lesgate?”

---

## LESGATE
I got bored. Thought it was time for a trade up. Don’t you like it?

---

## TONY
Love it. They drink, smiling at each other over their glasses. Would you like a cigar?

---

## LESGATE
I'll stick to my pipe, if you don't mind.

---

## TONY
That's one habit you've changed. At college you used to smoke rather expensive cigars. 

---

Here, look at this. A photo of us all at a reunion dinner. There you are, chewing on a huge Havana.

---

## LESGATE
That must be ten years ago. The first and last reunion I ever went to. What a murderous thug I look.

---

## TONY
You do rather. Of course, I always remember you because of the College Ball. 

---

You were treasurer the year the ticket money was stolen, weren’t you?

---

## LESGATE
Nearly a hundred pounds. I'd left it in a cash box in my study. In the morning, it had gone.

---

## TONY
It was the college porter, of course.

---

## LESGATE
Yes, poor old Alfred. They found the cash box in his back garden.

---

## TONY
But not the money.

---

## LESGATE
No.

---

## TONY
What are you doing nowadays?

---

## LESGATE
A little of this, a little of that. What about you?

---

## TONY
I work for a publishing house.

---

## LESGATE
Books, eh? Must do well by it. You have a very comfortable set-up.

---

## TONY
My wife has money.

---

## LESGATE
Ah. People with capital don't realize how lucky they are. I'm resigned to living on what I can earn.

---

## TONY
You could marry for money.

---

## LESGATE
Yes, I suppose some people make a profession of that.

---

## TONY
I know I did.

---

## LESGATE
You mean the girl you fell in love with happened to have some money of her own?

---

## TONY
No, I married for money, quite deliberately.

---

## LESGATE
Well — that's putting it bluntly.

---

## TONY
Have I shocked you?

---

## LESGATE
No, I always admire a man who knows what he wants.

---

## TONY
To know what you want to pay for, that's the thing. Everything has its price.

---

## LESGATE
Yes, quite. I haven't a great deal of time --

---

## TONY
I was telling you about marrying my wife.

---

## LESGATE
Yes, your “profession.”

---

## TONY
Oh, I had a profession before that. Avocation really. I was a writer.

---

## LESGATE
Would I have read anything you’ve written?

---

## TONY
Not unless you had a job rejecting manuscripts.

---

## LESGATE
I see. So you gave it up. Before or after you married for money?

---

## TONY
Oh, after. My wife was very taken with the idea of being married to a writer. 

---

There’s something about a tortured novelist burning with things to say and looking damn good while he’s not saying them. 

---

Full of promise which didn’t pan out.

---

## LESGATE
She hasn't left you because of it.

---

## TONY
She nearly did. Oh, not because I gave up on the writing. Get you another?

---

## LESGATE
Let me. You’ve got that groggy leg. 

---

## TONY
Thanks. Move the bottle over here. 

---

Would you like to hear about it? How my wife nearly left me.

---

## LESGATE
Your party, your brandy.

---

## TONY
It is, yes. I used to go around with a woman, another writer, more successful than me, by which I mean she was successful.

---

In those days, she’d written only short stories. Thrillers. Naturally, I pretended to look down on her stuff.

---

I was a “serious” writer. About the same time, I met this other girl, very pretty, with a nice inheritance in the offing.

---

We got married and set up here. Very placid and pleasant. I wrote like a demon, but I couldn’t get any what-the-Americans call action. 

---

Lots of activity though. I was always going off to do readings of this or that unpublished novel. Oxford. Cambridge. 

---

If it were a slow season, I’d go to Edinburgh. Lord, I went to Wales once. 

---

There were always people in the audience to listen to me. Women mostly. Young. My wife professed not to like that.

---

## LESGATE
With or without reason?

---

## TONY
With very good reason.

---

You see, long after I’d realized that I wasn’t getting action, I still enjoyed the activity: 

---

the travel, the stipend, the adoring faces, the charming room at the college inn or the department chair’s guest cottage.

---

I thought I was being clever, pulling the wool over my wife’s eyes.

---

I figured she wouldn’t catch on. But you know what happened?

---

## LESGATE
She caught on?

---

## TONY
No. I did.

---

## LESGATE
To what?

---

## TONY
She was having an affair. The usual tells: she lost weight, there were phone calls that would end abruptly when I came into the room. 

---

Then we had a row. I wanted to go to Oxford for the weekend, she didn't want me to.

---

I went to the bedroom to pack. Then the phone rang in here. It all sounded pretty urgent. 

---

After she rang off, she suddenly was rather keen that I should go to Oxford after all.

---

So I packed my kit into the car, drove off, parked two streets away and came back. 

---

Five minutes later she came out and took a taxi. I followed. She got out in Bywater Street, an address I knew well. 

---

I looked in through a window, and what do you think I saw?

---

## LESGATE
I’ve no idea.

---

## TONY
My wife. In the arms of a woman.

---

## LESGATE
Ohhh.

---

## TONY
Can you guess who the other woman was?

---

## LESGATE
The female writer of thrillers?

---

## TONY
Well done!

---

## LESGATE
Bit of a coincidence, that, don’t you think?

---

## TONY
By no means. I had introduced them. My friend, my wife.

---

And me blissfully unawares, going off on my little jaunts to play with young poetesses and disappointed faculty wives.

---

## LESGATE
I can’t imagine how you must have felt.

---

## TONY
Try.

---

## LESGATE
I’d be in a bloody rage. I’d feel like giving them both a good bashing.

---

## TONY
Ah, now, I suspected you and I would be similar in that respect.

---

We don’t like women enjoying the upper hand, do we?

---

## LESGATE
Did you burst in on them or --?

---

## TONY
Lord, no. I watched. They were cooking spaghetti over a gas ring. 

---

Funny how you can tell when two people are in love.

---

They were sharing a cigarette, just like in the movies.

---

The two of them seemed to be in the middle of a serious discussion. 

---

Then it became an argument, then tears, then my wife left. No one ate the spaghetti.

---

## LESGATE
What did you do?

---

## TONY
I went down to a pub at the end of the street and proceeded to drink heavily. 

---

I wondered: Was she going to leave me? What would happen if she did leave?

---

There was no question of me leaving her. No, I'd grown to depend on her. 

---

All these expensive tastes I'd acquired. I sat there and thought of three different ways of killing the other woman.

---

I thought of a few more of killing my wife. That seemed by far the more sensible route.

---

Margot and I had just made our wills, leaving everything we had to each other.

---

Hers worked out at just over two million pounds. 

---

When I returned home that night, there was Margot right where you’re sitting, asleep, that pillow stained with tears. 

---

I looked down on her for a long time. Then her eyes opened and she looked up at me, and I told her my writing days were over.

---

As fortune would have it, a publisher I knew had offered me a job.

---

He was never going to publish my books, but he thought I could be useful in public relations. 

---

I threw myself into it, and in three months I was assistant head of publicity. 

---

In six, I’d taken over the top job. They can’t do without me now.

---

And irony: I’m in charge of the sales push for the other woman’s first novel. She’s just arrived in London to promote it.

---

## LESGATE
She left England?

---

## TONY
Turns out the spaghetti was a farewell dinner. They’d broken it off, that night. 

---

There were letters, though, after, from New York. They usually arrived on Thursdays. 

---

My wife burnt all of them except one. That one she would transfer from handbag to handbag, it was always with her.

---

That letter became an obsession. I had to find out what was in it, so I stole it.

---

## LESGATE
You stole your wife’s love letters?

---

## TONY
I even wrote her two anonymous notes offering to sell it back.

---

## LESGATE
Why?

---

## TONY
Malice. I was hoping it would make her come and confess everything, beg my forgiveness. But she didn't.

---

## LESGATE
Christ. Did she pay up?

---

## TONY
Five thousand pounds. But I kept the letter.

---

## LESGATE
I’ll get it.

---

## TONY
Go on. Read.

---

---

## LESGATE
Very, erm, explicit.

---

[Lesgate laughs]

---

## TONY
Yes. Anyway, they must have had the fear of God put into them because after that the letters stopped.

---

Funny to think that just a year ago I was sitting in that pub, actually planning to murder my wife.

---

And I might have done it if I hadn't seen something that changed my mind.

---

## LESGATE
What was it you saw?

---

## TONY
I saw you.

---

## LESGATE
… What was so odd about that?

---

## TONY
The coincidence. Only a week before I'd been to a reunion dinner and the fellows had been talking about you,

---

how you'd been court-martialed during the war, then a year in prison. That was news.

---

Mind you, at college we'd always said Swann would end up in jail. That cash box.

---

Everybody knew Alfred didn’t take that money, you did.

---

## LESGATE
Thanks for the drink. I take it you won't be wanting that car after all.

---

## TONY
Don't you want me to tell you why I brought you here?

---

## LESGATE
Yes, I think you'd better.

---

## TONY
As I say, it was quite a coincidence, seeing you in “The Grape and Vine,” just down the street from that flat. 

---

I asked about and found that you rented a room above the pub. You weren’t Lesgate yet. 

---

The owner of The Grape and Vine knew you as “Pryce-Jones.” I liked the hyphen.

---

Would you mind passing me your glass? 

---

Thank you so much. You see, since that first night at the pub, I’ve been following you.

---

I was hoping that, sooner or later, I might catch you at something, so I could, well, 

---

## Tony
not to put too fine a point on it...

## LESGATE
Blackmail me?

---

## TONY
Influence you. After a few weeks, I got to know your routine which made it a lot easier.

---

## LESGATE
Rather dull work.

---

## TONY
It was, a bit, at first, but you know how it is,

---

you take up a hobby and the more you get to know of it the more fascinating it becomes. 

---

You became quite fascinating. In fact, there were times when I felt that you belonged to me.

---

You moved from “The Grape and Vine” and took lodgings in South Kensington under the name “Asprey.” 

---

Six weeks later, you disappeared, owing six weeks rent and 50 pounds borrowed from your landlady.

---

If you want another drink, do you mind putting on these gloves?

---

Your new lodgings were in Belsize Park.There Mr. Asprey became Mr. Waterhouse.

---

Mr. Waterhouse left those lodgings owing fifteen weeks and somewhat richer for his brief encounter with a Miss Wallace. 

---

Miss Wallace was in love with you, wasn't she? 

---

I suppose she thought you were growing that handsome mustache to please her. Poor Miss Wallace.

---

By summer you’d moved to another flat owned by a Mrs. Van Dorn whose late husband left her two hotels and a very large apartment house. 

---

That’s where you became Captain Lesgate.

---

The only trouble is, Mrs. Van Dorn does rather enjoy being courted, and she is very expensive. 

---

Perhaps that's why you've been trying to sell her car for over a month.

---

## LESGATE
Mrs. Van Dorn asked me to sell it for her.

---

## TONY
I know. I called her up earlier today. She only wanted eight hundred.

---

## LESGATE
Where's the nearest police station?

---

## TONY
Opposite the church, two minutes walk.

---

## LESGATE
Suppose I go there now?

---

## TONY
What would you tell them?

## LESGATE
I shall tell them you are trying to blackmail me into...

---

## TONY
Yes?

---

## LESGATE
Murdering your wife.

---

## TONY
And if you did, I’d say you came here tonight, half drunk,

---

and tried to borrow money on the strength that we were at college together. 

---

When I refused you said something about a letter belonging to my wife.

---

As far as I could make out you were offering to sell it to me.

---

I gave you what money I had and you gave me the letter.

---

It has your fingerprints on it. Remember?

---

Then you said if I went to the police you’d tell some crazy story about my wanting you to murder my wife.

---

But before we go any further, consider the inconvenience.

---

I’d have to tell the police Captain Lesgate’s name is really Swann.

---

The tricky thing there is that C.A. Swann died four years ago.

---

Yes, I found the obituary. Motoring accident, body burned beyond recognition.

---

I take it whomever you put behind the wheel was your first victim.

---

## LESGATE
What do you mean, ‘first’?

---

## TONY
Well, I mean to say, I assume he was the first, just as I assume the second was Miss Wallace.

---

She was in all the papers. Middle-aged woman found dead from drug overdose.

---

No one knows who gave the stuff to her. But we know, don't we? 

---

Poor Miss Wallace. And now you’re planning to marry Mrs. Van Dorn, am I right?

---

## LESGATE
Smart, aren't you?

---

## TONY
Not really, I've just had time to think things out, put myself in your position. 

---

That's why I know you're going to agree.

---

## LESGATE
Why?

---

## TONY
For the same reason that a donkey with a stick behind him and a carrot in front goes forwards and not backwards.

---

## LESGATE
Tell me about the carrot.

---

## TONY
Five thousand pounds in cash.

---

## LESGATE
For a murder?

---

## TONY
For a few minutes work. At no risk.

---

I do think a honeymoon with Mrs. Van Dorn would be preferable to the hangman’s noose.

---

Five thousand pounds should see you safely married and on the Continent. 

---

You'll find it makes such a difference to have money in your pocket.

---

## LESGATE
This five thousand pounds, where is it? 

---

## LESGATE
Is this the five thousand your wife paid to...?

## TONY
Hm-hm.

---

## LESGATE
How much is there?

---

## TONY
The full amount. I don’t think you’ll do a runner, not with Mrs. Van Dorn in your future and me knowing about Miss Wallace and the rest.

---

## LESGATE
When would this take place?

---

## TONY
Tomorrow night.

## LESGATE
Tomorrow?! Not a chance.

---

## TONY
It's got to be tomorrow, I've arranged things that way.

---

## LESGATE
Where?

---

## TONY
Approximately where you're standing now.

---

## LESGATE
How?

---

## TONY
Tomorrow evening, at exactly eight o’clock you will enter the house by the street door. 

---

The street door is always unlocked.  You'll find the key to the front door under the stair carpet out in the hall. On the fifth step.

---

## LESGATE
The fifth step.

## TONY
That's the one. Use it to unlock the front door… and go straight to hide in the alcove.

---

## LESGATE
What if she’s right here?

---

## TONY
She won’t be. She’ll be listening to a radio program. The radio is in our bedroom.

---

At exactly ten minutes past eight that phone will ring. It will be me, telephoning from the BBC studios across Regents Park. That’s my alibi.

---

## TONY
The radio program’s an interview with the female novelist. I shall be there with her.

## LESGATE
All right, then.

---

## TONY
I shall use the phone in the control booth. I shall dial this number. 

---

There’s no extension in the bedroom, so when the phone rings she will come in here to answer it.  You stay hidden in that alcove until she answers the phone. 

---

When you’ve finished, pick up the phone and give me a soft whistle. Then hang up. When I hear your whistle I shall hang up.

---

## LESGATE
What happens then?

## TONY
Make a mess of things.

---

## TONY
Upend the coffee table, knock over that cigarette box and those silver trays. But leave it all here.

---

## LESGATE
As if I left in a hurry?

---

## TONY
Now, the French doors. If they’re locked, unlock them and leave them open.  Then go out exactly the same way as you came in.

---

## LESGATE
By the front door?

## TONY
Yes. And here's the most important thing. 

---

## TONY
As you go out, return the key to the place where you found it.

---

## LESGATE
Under the fifth stair carpet?

---

## TONY
The police will assume you entered by way of the French Doors. You thought the flat was empty and went to work.

---

She heard something and came in here. You attacked her. 

---

When you realized you’d killed her, you panicked and bolted into the garden leaving your loot behind.

---

## LESGATE
Just a minute. I'm supposed to have entered through the French Doors.  Suppose they’d been locked?

---

## TONY
It wouldn’t matter. She often takes a walk round the garden before she goes to bed, 

---

and she usually forgets to lock those doors when she gets back. That’s what I’ll tell the police.

---

## LESGATE
But she may say...

## TONY
But she isn't going to say anything. Is she?

---

## LESGATE
Why can’t I just leave by way of the garden?

---

## TONY
There’s an iron gate to the street. It’s locked at night, so you’d have to climb over it. If anyone saw you, you’d likely be followed.

---

## LESGATE
Right. So, I leave the flat, put the key back under the stair carpet, and go out by the street door. When will you get back?

---

## TONY
About eleven. I’ll bring the other woman back here for a nightcap. We shall find her together.

---

## LESGATE
You've forgotten something. When you return, how will you get into the flat?

---

## TONY
I’ll let myself in.

---

## LESGATE
But your key will be under the stair carpet. The other woman is bound to see you take it out. It’ll give the whole show away.

---

## TONY
No, it won't be my key under the carpet. It will be my wife’s.

---

I’ll take it from her handbag and hide it out there just before I leave the flat.

---

She won't be going out tomorrow night so she won't miss it. When I return I'll use my own key to let us in. 

---

Then, before the police arrive, I’ll find a moment to take her key from under the stair carpet and return it to her handbag.

---

## LESGATE
How many keys are there to that door?

---

## TONY
Two keys. Just hers and mine.

---

[telephone rings]

---

## TONY (To the phone)
Maida Vale 0401.

---

Hullo, darling, how's it going? -- Dreadful?

---

Good. Does Maxine hate it as much as you? 

---

Make a bet on who the killer is, and tell me who wins.

---

Oh, darling, just a minute, I think there's someone at the door.

---

## TONY (To Lesgate)
Careful, you might be seen from there.

---

## TONY (To the phone)
Sorry, darling, false alarm. -- No, No, go. -- Enjoy yourself. 

---

## TONY (To Lesgate)
Well?

---

---

[Dramatic Music]

---

## TONY (Voiceover)
Tomorrow evening, exactly eight o’clock. You will find the key to the front door under the stair carpet in the hall, on the fifth step.

---

You will use the key to unlock the door. You will hide in the alcove. When the phone rings she will come in. 

---

When you’ve finished, give a soft whistle. And here is the most important thing:

---

As you go out, return the key to the place where you found it, under the fifth stair carpet.

---

[Dramatic Music Continues]

---

## MARGOT
Do you enjoy thinking up ways to kill people?

---

## MAXINE
I never have to think up ways of killing people. Ways of killing people bubble up in my head all the time. 

---

I’m simply putting my natural instincts to good use.

---

## MARGOT
“Can anyone be a killer?”

---

## MAXINE
Oh, yes. Given the right circumstances. Any of us, even the nicest, most passive milquetoast can be a killer. 

---

Note that I did not say murderer. Murder is a legal term. One can kill with moral intent. That’s what we call it in war.

---

## TONY
I’m not sure you need to get into all that.

## MAXINE
Well, it’s true.

---

## MARGOT
She’s right, it is.

---

## TONY
I know, but it’s a talks program about thrillers, not moral philosophy. They’ve got Bertrand Russell for that. 

---

Read that last question, would you, darling?

---

## MARGOT
“Is there such a thing as a perfect murder? And if so, can you cite an example?”

---

## MAXINE
If I could cite an example, it wouldn’t be a perfect murder.

---

There are people who’ve committed murders who walk amongst us every day, on the street, in tea shops, at the pub.

---

A murderer might be sitting on your sofa or lying next to you in bed.

---

## MARGOT
That’s very good.

---

## MAXINE
Thank you.

---

## TONY
Right, that’s the lot.

---

## MARGOT
Won’t they ask what you’re working on next? They always do on programs like these.

---

## TONY
The voice of authority.

---

## MAXINE
I can say, “Yes, I am, but it’s early days.”

---

## TONY
Is that true?

---

## MAXINE
Yes.

---

## TONY
Well, tell. Come on, you know you want to show off.

---

## MAXINE
Okay. A woman - she’s married - is supposed to meet her lover at a hotel,

---

but she knows her husband’s hired a private detective to follow her.

---

So, when she arrives, she doesn’t go to straight up to the room, she goes to the bar and orders a drink.

---

She wants to figure out who the private detective is. A man comes in, orders something. 

---

The wife notices him looking at her. He’s the only man in the bar. She starts a conversation with him.

---

She’s making sure the detective knows she’s spotted him, if she’s spotted him, he’ll have to give up the chase. 

---

They chat. The man leaves the bar, leaves the hotel, the wife goes up to the room.

---

Next day her husband tells her his private detective saw her go into that room. 

---

The wife is stunned. The man she talked to in the bar didn’t follow her up to the room, she’s certain. 

---

How did she get it so wrong?

---

## TONY
Uhm --

---

## MARGOT
The private detective was a woman. The wife assumed the private detective was a man because private detectives are always men.

---

She noticed a man in the bar looking at her, but she didn’t notice if any of the women were.

---

## TONY
Is that it?

---

## MAXINE
It will be now. Do we have time for one more?

---

## TONY
A quick one.

## MARGOT
Me too.

---

## TONY
Oh, darling, I can’t seem to find my latchkey. May I borrow yours?

---

## MARGOT
Mine?

## TONY
Yes.

---

## MARGOT
What if I go out?

---

## TONY
I thought you were staying in this evening.

---

## MARGOT
Why should I? The two of you are going to be out and about, at the BBC, having a late supper at the Savoy Grill.

---

## MAXINE
Join us. Meet us at the Savoy. We’ll get tight as a drum.

---

## MARGOT
You’re sweet, but no. Mr. Pottifer always manages to put his hands where he shouldn’t, no matter how far away we’re seated.

---

## MAXINE
What will you do instead, go to a movie?

---

## TONY
I supposed you were going to listen to Maxine’s interview.

---

## MARGOT
Would you like me to?

---

## MAXINE
Be nice to know how I come across.

---

## MARGOT
Your voice can get brittle sometimes.

---

## MAXINE
When?

---

## MARGOT
When you’re nervous.

---

## MAXINE
I’m never nervous. Give me a shot of bourbon just before they turn on the microphone. 

---

## MAXINE
Oh!

## MARGOT
Tony!

---

## TONY
Sorry. I’m a clod, I know --

## MAXINE
It’s okay, it’s --

---

## MARGOT
No, that’ll leave a stain.

---

## MAXINE
It’s a radio interview, no one’s going to see it.

---

## MARGOT
You reek of bourbon. The interviewer will think you’re a dipsomaniac. I’ve got some remover in my basket.

---

## TONY
Is the remover the little brown bottle?

---

## MARGOT
Yes, it’s in here somewhere.

---

## TONY
Actually, I think it’s in the bedroom.

---

## MARGOT
Is it? Come on, I’ll get it out.

---

---

[Music]

---

## MAXINE (offstage)
What’s in the remover?

## MARGOT (offstage)
Acid, naturally.

---

## MAXINE (offstage)
Oh, good, make sure it burns an enormous hole.

---

## MARGOT (offstage)
It’d be easier if you took it off.

---

## MAXINE (offstage)
I suspected you had ulterior motives.

---

## MARGOT (offstage)
[laughs]

Stop it!

---

## MAXINE (offstage)
[laughs]

You’re the one who said “Take off your dress”!

---

## MARGOT (offstage)
I’m talking about the spot!

---

## MAXINE (offstage)
“Out, out damn’d spot!”

---

[Music Stops]

---

## TONY
Look. My latchkey. It was in my glove the whole time.

---

## MAXINE
Mystery solved.

---

## TONY
Now we’ve got to run.

---

## MAXINE
The studio isn't far, is it?

---

## TONY
No, just across the park, a three minute walk if we’re brisk.

---

## MAXINE
Anything you want me to slip into the interview?

---

## MARGOT
What, like "And a fond hullo to Margot Wendice, famous shutin?"

---

Find a way to sneak “button mushrooms” into one of your answers.

---

## MAXINE
Button mushrooms.

---

## MARGOT
Bet a quid?

---

## MAXINE
You’re on.

---

## TONY
Good night, darling.

---

## MARGOT
Have fun.

---

## MAXINE
Night, sweets.

---

---

## MARGOT
Be brilliant!

---

---

[Music]

---

## BBC INTERVIEWER (over radio)
This evening our guest is Maxine Hadley, author of “Your Death Is Necessary”. 

---

It’s being advertised as a thriller. Is it a thriller?

---

## MAXINE (over radio)
Well, my publishers call it a thriller.

---

## BBC INTERVIEWER (over radio)
It certainly looks like a thriller from the dust jacket.

---

## MAXINE (over radio)
Lurid, isn’t it?

---

## BBC INTERVIEWER (over radio)
I suppose the first thing, really, is to define what we’re talking about when we use the word “thriller.”

---

## MAXINE (over radio)
I’d say they’re novels that thrill.

---

## MAXINE (over radio)
Wilkie Collins called his books sensation novels, because they caused the reader to feel the sensations of dread, horror, suspense.

---

But I think all novels should have those sensations, at least to a degree.

---

## BBC INTERVIEWER (over radio)
What’s the difference between a thriller and a mystery?

---

## MAXINE (over radio)
In a murder mystery, the question is something like who killed Lord Frumfry in the library? 

---

In a thriller, the questions are will this or that character commit murder, what’s the killer after, will he kill again?

---

## BBC INTERVIEWER (over radio)
And you’ve got to have a good villain.

---

## MAXINE (over radio)
A good villain is essential.

---

## BBC INTERVIEWER (over radio)
Although, in my own experience, I don’t think I’ve ever encountered anyone who was an out and out villain.

---

## MAXINE (over radio)
I have.

---

## BBC INTERVIEWER (over radio)
Really?

---

## MAXINE (over radio)
Oh, yes. So have you, you just didn’t know it.

---

## BBC INTERVIEWER (over radio)
You may be right, there. So, then, what are the essential elements of a good thriller?

---

## MAXINE (over radio)
Well, it should have at least one murder. Preferably more. In ascending levels of violence.

---

There must be suspense. Questions must be posed. 

---

Events foreshadowed. And of course the stakes must be high.

---

## BBC INTERVIEWER (over radio)
High enough for one of the characters to commit murder, I should think.

---

## MAXINE (over radio)
Yes, motive is everything, even if the murder is unplanned.

---

[Music]

---

---

[Door opens, and slams shut]

---

## MARGOT
Who are you? What are you doing here?

---

## LESGATE
I’m afraid I’ve come to kill you.

---

## MARGOT
… Is this a joke?

---

## LESGATE
Actually, it isn’t, no. I... I was paid 5000 pounds to murder you. But I --

---

## MARGOT
Don’t come nearer!

---

## LESGATE
Sorry. What I was going to say is: I don’t have to go through with it. 

---

Killing you. I mean, I’ve got my money. Your money, actually.

---

## MARGOT
My money?

---

## LESGATE
The 5000 pounds you paid for that letter you never got back. The blackmail.

---

Pretty neat trick, you must admit, getting you to pay for your own murder. 

---

The thing is it’s all planned out to the minute. It’s got to take place precisely at ten after eight.

---

## MARGOT
Ten after eight?

---

## LESGATE
Because of the alibi. Do you hear it? The radio?

---

## MAXINE (Over radio)
I’m always more interested in the murderer than the victim.

---

## LESGATE
Don’t you want to know who paid me?

## MARGOT
Who?

---

## LESGATE
Yes, well, the price for that is 10,000 pounds. Isn’t too much to find out who it is wants you dead, is it? Hm? 

---

Don’t touch that phone!

---

## MARGOT
The police are just around the corner.

## LESGATE
Don’t. Touch it.

---

[phone rings]

---

[intense music]

---

[sudden loud music]

[Lesgate chokes]

---

## MARGOT
Police! Get the police!

[Lesgate stops breathing]

---

Tony? Tony, come home! Come home, now, quickly, please! A man attacked me! He tried to strangle me.

---

No, he's dead. Tony? Tony, are you still there?

---

Yes? Yes, I'm listening.

---

I won’t, I won’t call anyone, I won’t touch anything. I promise, only be quick!

---

[Margot sobs]

---

---

## MARGOT
Oh, Tony!

## TONY
It's all right, it'll be all right. What happened?

---

## MARGOT
He tried to strangle me. He got something around my throat, it felt like a stocking.

---

## TONY
But the scissors--

## MARGOT
I stabbed him.

---

## TONY
The blades went right through.

---

## MARGOT
Cover him, can’t you?

---

## TONY
Yes, of course. Did he --? What are you doing?

---

## MARGOT
Looking for an aspirin. My head’s pounding.

---

## TONY
Here, let me. I’ll get you some water. He must have broken in. I wonder what he was after.

---

## MARGOT
When will the police get here?

---

## TONY
Did you call them?

---

## MARGOT
No. You told me not to speak to anyone. Hadn't you better call them now?

---

## TONY
In a minute, in a minute.

---

---

## MARGOT
I'll get dressed.

## TONY
Why?

---

## MARGOT
They'll want to talk to me.

## TONY
Right, yes..

---

## MARGOT
Maxine’s still at the studio.

---

## TONY
I told them to tell her there was a minor emergency.

---

## MARGOT
..Tony?

## TONY
Hm?

---

## MARGOT
Why did you phone?

---

## TONY
… I’ll tell you about that later. You said he used a stocking?

---

## MARGOT
I think it was a stocking, or a scarf. Isn't it there?

---

## TONY
No. But I expect the police will find it. Go and change. I'll phone them right away. 

---

---

Hello, Operator, give me the Maida Vale Police, quickly. 

---

Yes, hello. There’s been a ghastly accident, a man’s been killed.

---

 Wendice. -- 61a Charrington Gardens. -- About ten minutes ago. 

---

He broke in and attacked my wife. A burglar, so it seems. How long until you can get here?

---

Two minutes. Good. -- No, we won’t touch anything. Good-bye.

---

---

## BBC INTERVIEWER (over radio)
Do you think there’s such a thing as a perfect murder?

---

## MAXINE (over radio)
Absolutely. On paper, I could plan a murder better than most people, but I doubt I could carry it out.

---

## BBC INTERVIEWER (over radio)
Really?

---

## MAXINE (over radio)
Oh, I might be able to carry it out, but in stories things turn out as the author plans them to, in real life they don't. 

---

I'm sure I’d make some stupid mistake and not realize it until the end when I saw that everyone was looking at me.

---

## BBC INTERVIEWER (over radio)
Can you give our listeners an example?

---

## MAXINE (over radio)
Oh, let’s see. A housewife makes dinner for her husband. Spaghetti with mushrooms.

---

The husband eats the dinner and dies, apparently of a heart attack. As his body is being taken away, something falls from his trouser cuff.

---

They test it and find it’s full of poison. What fell out of his trouser cuff? A button mushroom.

---

[front door buzzer]

---

## TONY
That’ll be the police. Margot?

---

## MARGOT
Yes?

---

## TONY
Did he say anything?

---

---

## MARGOT
No.

---

[End of Act 1]

---

---

[Music]

---

## TONY (On the phone)
No, I’m sorry, my wife can’t see anyone just now. I’m afraid not, sorry, good-bye.

---

## MARGOT
Who was that?

---

## TONY
Another reporter.

---

## MARGOT
How many is that now?

---

## TONY
The fourth. So far.

---

[front door buzzer]

## TONY
I’ll get it.

---

---

## MAXINE
Where’s Margot?

## TONY
Here, come --

---

---

## MAXINE
Did he hurt you?

---

## TONY
Just some bruising. On her throat.

---

## MAXINE
Jesus. Why didn’t you tell me what happened?

## TONY
Look, I know --

---

## MAXINE
When they said it was a minor emergency, I figured it was something like a bathtub leak. Reading it in the papers this morning --

---

## TONY
Yes, sorry, I should have phoned your hotel, but the police kept us rather busy last night. 

---

They didn’t leave until past three. Would you like coffee? I can make some.

---

## MAXINE
No. Thanks.

---

## TONY
I’d, erm, best change. Keep Margot company, would you?

---

---

## MAXINE
What’s the matter?

---

## MARGOT
Didn’t you hear? I stuck a pair of scissors into a man last night. I’m a murderer now.

---

## MAXINE
No, you’re not. You defended yourself.

---

## MARGOT
I did. Yes.

---

## MAXINE
I’m proud of you.

---

## MARGOT
Are you?

---

## MAXINE
Of course I am. If you hadn’t done what you did... The papers say it was a burglary.

---

## MARGOT
Do they?

---

## MAXINE
Well, isn’t that what it was?

---

## MARGOT
That’s not what he said.

## MAXINE
Who?

---

## MARGOT
The man who attacked me.

---

## MAXINE
... He spoke to you?

## MARGOT
Oh, yes.

---

## MAXINE
What did he say?

## MARGOT
He said... 

---

## Margot
He said he’d been paid 5,000 pounds to murder me.

## MAXINE
What?

---

## MARGOT
He said: “I’ve got my money. Your money, actually.”

---

## MAXINE
The 5000 pounds you paid for the letter?

---

## MARGOT
He called it a neat trick, getting a person to pay for her own murder.

---

## MAXINE
Who did he say sent him?

---

## MARGOT
We never got that far. I was wondering if it might have been you.

---

## MAXINE
I’m sorry?

---

## MARGOT
You could have written those blackmail notes, and when you got the money, you could’ve used it to pay him to kill me.

---

## MAXINE
Just why should I do that?

---

## MARGOT
Revenge. For my breaking things off. It is one of your five reasons, isn’t it? Revenge?

---

And it’s the sort of thing you think up, plotting how to murder people, working it out. 

---

He said the murder was planned, it was planned to take place at precisely ten after eight.

---

It had to take place precisely then because the alibi was the radio.

---

## MAXINE
Why would his alibi be the radio?

---

## MARGOT
That’s what I couldn’t figure. But then I’m stupid. He didn’t say it was his alibi.

---

He said it was the alibi. It didn’t hit me until I realized I could hear your voice. I’d tuned in just as I said I would.

---

He had to kill me at that moment precisely because that was when you were on the Talks Program. 

---

## MARGOT
An alibi of three million listeners.

## MAXINE
Margot, this --

---

## MARGOT
Then I thought about your letter that I couldn’t destroy. It was so passionate, uncharacteristically so.

---

I started to wonder if you’d written about us that way for a reason: so the letter couldn’t help but be read as incriminating. 

---

No one reading a letter like that could think our friendship was innocent, not after you’d described it that way. 

---

It would be unmistakable that we’d been lovers. I’d have no choice but to buy it back, a boringly conventional woman like me, so fearful of scandal.

---

You were right, 5000 pounds didn’t make much of a difference to me.

---

But it could make quite a difference to a struggling writer living in a sixth floor walkup.

---

## MAXINE
Just so I’ve got this straight: I wrote a love letter so I could blackmail you for 5,000 pounds, then used that 5000 pounds to have you killed.

---

## MARGOT
Does it work?

---

## MAXINE
It’s good. May I steal it?

---

## MARGOT
It’s all yours. Even, even the blackmail notes I showed to you, you actually managed to make me give them back to you.

---

## MAXINE
“Back” to me? What, you think I did that to cover my tracks?

---

## MARGOT
Where are they now?

---

## MAXINE
At my hotel.

---

## MARGOT
And probably hard to find.

---

## MAXINE
Do you know how crazy you sound?

---

## MARGOT
I killed a man last night!

---

## MAXINE
I know. Didn’t think you had it in you. I see now that you do. 

---

What did the police think when you told them this man said he’d been paid to kill you?

---

## MARGOT
I didn’t tell the police.

---

## MAXINE
Why not?

---

## MARGOT
Because if I told them that, I’d have to tell them the rest, about the money, the letter, us.

---

## MAXINE
Did you tell Tony?

---

## MARGOT
The only person I’ve told is you.

## MAXINE
Why?

---

## MARGOT
To see how you’d react.

---

## MAXINE
Are you satisfied?

---

## MARGOT
Not really.

---

[front door buzzer]

---

## TONY (offstage)
Margot? Can you get it?

---

## MARGOT
I’d rather not right now!

---

---

## TONY
..I’ll get it, then, shall I?

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD (offstage)
Mr. Wendice?

---

## TONY (offstage)
Yes.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD (offstage)
My name’s Hubbard. May I come in?

---

## TONY (offstage)
Yes, please.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Mrs. Wendice. I’m Chief Inspector Hubbard.

---

## TONY
Erm, Inspector, this is Miss Hadley. A friend of ours.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Maxine Hadley. You and Mr. Wendice were together last evening.

---

## MAXINE
Yes.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Why was that?

## MAXINE
Why was what?

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Why were the two of you together?

---

## TONY
Miss Hadley was being interviewed for a talks program at the BBC.

---

## MAXINE
Mr. Wendice works for my publisher.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
You’re an author?

---

## MARGOT
Miss Hadley writes murder mysteries.

---

## TONY
Erm, what can we do for you, Inspector? We gave your people all the necessary information last night.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Yes, I’m sure, but there are a few things I'd like to get first hand. May I..?

---

## TONY
Of course.

---

## MAXINE
I should be going.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Oh, Miss Hadley, we may want to go over the odd detail with you later. Could you give me your address?

---

## MAXINE
I’m staying at the Ritz.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Write it there for me, would you? Room number, all that.

---

## MAXINE
Okay.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Is this your first visit to London?

## MAXINE
No, I used to live here.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
For how long?

## MAXINE
Three years.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Where?

## MAXINE
Chelsea. Bywater Street.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Off the King’s Road.

## MAXINE
Yes.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
That’s just down from “The Grape and Vine”, isn’t it?

---

## MAXINE
If you say so.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
When did you leave London?

---

## MAXINE
A year ago.

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Thank you.

---

## MAXINE
I, erm, may drop by later, if that’s all right.

---

## TONY
Yes, please do. I’ll see you out.

## MAXINE
No, I know the way.

---

## TONY
Shall we sit?

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Thank you. That was a very nasty experience you had last night, Mrs. Wendice.

---

## TONY
Erm, do you know yet who the man was?

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
We’re uncertain as to his real name. He had several. Pryce-Jones, Asprey, Waterhouse. 

---

The one he was going by recently was Lesgate. Had you seen him before, Mrs. Wendice?

---

## MARGOT
No, of course not.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Morgue photographs. Do you recognize him?

---

## MARGOT
Yes.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
You do? From...?

---

## MARGOT
From last night.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
No, I meant from before.

---

## MARGOT
I told you I’d never seen him before.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Yes, of course, sorry. How about you, sir? Ever seen him?

---

## TONY
No. No. At least... There is something familiar about him.

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Oh?

---

## TONY
Yes, but for whatever reason, I’m picturing him without a mustache.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
So you think you might have met him?

---

## TONY
Not met him, I’m sure of that. But ..

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Saw him?

---

## TONY
Saw him, yes. I’m thinking it was at a railway station.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Mrs. Wendice, would you show me where you were last night when things happened?

---

## MARGOT
I was in our bedroom listening to the radio. I came in here to fix a drink.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Did you switch a light on?

---

## MARGOT
No.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Would you show me where you were when he attacked you?

---

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
You said you went to fix yourself a drink.

---

## MARGOT
Erm, yes, but then I went to the desk.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
After you fixed yourself a drink?

---

## MARGOT
I didn’t fix myself a drink.

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Why not?

---

## MARGOT
Because the phone rang.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
This was your husband calling?

## TONY
Yes.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Why were you calling your wife, sir?

## MARGOT
Yes, why did you phone me?

---

## TONY
I wanted to see if I could change your mind about going to supper. Miss Hadley and I were going to the Savoy.

---

My wife had elected not to join us. I felt guilty about you spending the evening alone.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Right, then. You come in here, you go to the drinks table, the phone rings, you go over to the desk.

---

## MARGOT
I went to the desk and I picked up the phone. That’s when he attacked me.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Attacked you how?

## MARGOT
He got something round my neck.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
By "something” you mean..?

## MARGOT
It felt like a silk stocking or a silk scarf.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
What happened then?

---

## MARGOT
He got the stocking or whatever it was around my neck and pushed me over the desk. I remember feeling for the scissors.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Were those scissors usually on the desk?

---

## MARGOT
No, usually they’re in that mending basket there, but I'd forgotten to put them away.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
So, you forgot to put them away, but you remembered they were on the desk.

---

## MARGOT
I didn’t so much remember, I felt them.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
So you felt for the scissors..?

---

## MARGOT
I felt around, and.. and my hands found the scissors, and I.. I... I stabbed him with them.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Yes, I see. How do you suppose he got in?

---

## MARGOT
Through the French Doors there.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Why do you think that?

---

## MARGOT
Erm, because...

## TONY
Because when I got back those doors were wide open.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Were they locked last night?

---

## TONY
They were locked when Miss Hadley and I left for the studio.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Are you quite sure?

## TONY
I always lock them when I leave the flat.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Then how did he get in?

---

## TONY
We assume... Well, he must have jimmied the lock.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
The lock was carefully examined. It’s quite undamaged. And there’s no glass broken.

---

## TONY
But that doesn’t make sense. Darling, did you open the French doors last night?

---

## MARGOT
Once, to get some air.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
When was this?

---

## MARGOT
After he attacked me.

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Not before?

---

## MARGOT
No.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Are you sure?

---

## MARGOT
Yes.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Mrs. Wendice, why didn’t you ring the police immediately this happened?

---

## MARGOT
I thought my husband would call them.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
And it didn’t occur to you to call for a doctor?

---

## MARGOT
No.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Why not?

---

## MARGOT
He was dead.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
How did you know that?

---

## MARGOT
It was obvious.

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Did you feel his pulse?

---

## MARGOT
No.

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Did you check to see if he was breathing?

---

## MARGOT
I didn’t want to get near him, he’d just tried to kill me!

---

## TONY
Inspector, the French Doors. If the man didn't come in that way, how did he get in?

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
As a matter of fact, we’re quite certain he came in by your front door.

---

## MARGOT
But the front door is always locked.

---

## TONY
Margot, did you open the door and forget to lock it after we'd gone?

## MARGOT
No.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Are you quite certain you didn’t?

---

## MARGOT
I’m positive.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
How many keys are there to the front door?

---

## MARGOT
Only two. Mine was in my handbag and Tony had his with him.

---

## TONY
That’s right, I did.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Do you employ a charwoman?

---

## MARGOT
Yes, but she hasn't got a key. I'm always in when she comes.

---

## TONY
What makes you think he came in through the front door?

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
His shoes. It was raining last night. The ground was soaking wet. Muddy.

---

If he’d come in through the French Doors by way of the garden he’d have left footprints all over the floor.

---

He didn’t leave any because he wiped his shoes on the door mat.

---

## TONY
How do you know that?

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
It's a fairly new mat and some of its fibers came off on his shoes. 

---

Also, there was some tar on the mat and some of that got on his shoes as well. There's no question about it.

---

## TONY
Wait a minute, I think I've got it. Do you remember that time when your handbag was stolen?

---

## MARGOT
Yes.

---

## TONY
Wasn't your key inside?

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Hang on, I'd like to hear about this.

---

## TONY
My wife lost a handbag at, where was it, Victoria Station? 

---

It was that weekend we went down to Portsmouth to see Peggy’s new boat.

---

We were in the station restaurant, and I said something like “That fellow there seems awfully interested in you.” Remember?

---

## MARGOT
I don't remember a man, but it was at Victoria where I lost my bag.

---

## TONY
That photograph you showed us, that was the man!

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Did you get your bag back?

---

## MARGOT
From the lost and found office about a week later.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Was anything missing?

---

## MARGOT
Just a few pounds.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Nothing else was taken?

## MARGOT
No.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
No papers or letters?

## MARGOT
No.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Was your latchkey in your handbag when you lost it?

---

## MARGOT
Yes, but it was still there when it was returned.

---

## TONY
Whoever stole the bag could have had the key copied. 

---

He could have had a duplicate key made and returned the original to the bag.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
So he could have stolen your handbag, taken your key, copied it and used the duplicate key to open your front door.

---

## MARGOT
Yes, he could have.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
But of course he didn't.

---

## TONY
Why not?

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Because if he had, that duplicate key would still have been on him when he died. 

---

But no key was found when we went through his pockets.

---

## MARGOT
No key?

---

## TONY
So we’re back where we started.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
I'd like you both to make an official statement before the inquest. 

---

The station is only two minutes from here. Perhaps you could come now?

---

## TONY
If that’s what we should do...

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
It won’t take long. Mr. Wendice, I wonder if you might look out the street door. 

---

There was a small group of nosy parkers gathered when I came in. 

---

People read in their papers about a murder, and they line up like it’s Madame Tussaud’s.

---

## TONY
Of course.

---

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
How much does he know?

---

## MARGOT
What?

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Your husband, how much does he know about you and your friend Miss Hadley. She wrote this letter to you from New York.

---

## MARGOT
How did you get that?

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
It was found on the dead man, in one of his pockets. 

---

It makes for rather salacious reading. Any idea how it ended up on the body?

---

## MARGOT
No.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
When you lost your handbag at Victoria Station, did you lose this letter as well? 

---

Mrs. Wendice, your husband will be back any moment.

---

## MARGOT
Yes, that letter was missing when I got back my handbag.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
I asked you that before. You lied. Why?

---

## MARGOT
I didn’t want my husband to know! I --

[Door opens]

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Miss Hadley. Forget something?

---

## MAXINE
I did, as a matter of fact. My gloves.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Yes, I was wondering when you’d come back for them. How is it out there?

---

## TONY
We’ve got a full blown mob. If we’re to go to the station, you’ll have to have your men disperse them.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
It would be simpler to give them the slip by way of your garden. Unless they’ve gathered there too.

---

Mr. Wendice, would you mind checking?

---

## TONY
Of course, Inspector.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
All right, Miss Hadley, I got rid of Mr. Wendice for you.

---

You came back because you wanted to tell me something. Is it about this?

---

## MAXINE
How did...?

## MARGOT
The police found it on Lesgate.

---

## MAXINE
Lesgate?

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
The man Mrs. Wendice killed. A Mrs. Van Dorn let us into Lesgate’s flat this morning.

---

Behind a mirror we found 5,000 pounds in sealed bank notes. We traced the serial numbers to your bank, Mrs. Wendice. 

---

You took out those same bank notes six months ago. Would you care to explain how Lesgate ended up with them?

---

## MARGOT
I told you before, I never met any man named Lesgate!

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Six months ago, he was calling himself Pryce-Jones and living above The Grape and Vine off Bywater Street. 

---

Did you happen to frequent The Grape and Vine when you were living there, Miss Hadley?

---

## MAXINE
If The Grape and Vine was the closest purveyor of liquor, it’s a good bet I did, 

---

but I didn’t know a Pryce-Jones or Lesgate or whatever he was calling himself! 

---

All I know is someone was blackmailing Mrs. Wendice! After she lost that letter, she received two notes. This is one of them.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Where’s the other?

---

## MAXINE
At my hotel somewhere, I couldn’t find it.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
How did you get them?

---

## MAXINE
Mrs. Wendice showed them to me the day before yesterday.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
You paid the blackmailer five thousand pounds, didn’t you?

---

## MARGOT
Yes.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
How did you get him the money?

---

## MARGOT
I sent it to that address, like the note said to.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
And you got back the letter?

---

## MARGOT
I never got it back.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Is that why you met with him last night?

---

## MARGOT
What?

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
To say you’d paid him the five thousand pounds he wanted, now give back the letter?

---

## MARGOT
I didn’t speak to him!

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
The evidence suggests you were in the middle of entertaining him.

---

## MARGOT
This is ridiculous.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
You say you came in here to make yourself a drink. But my men found two cocktail glasses.

---

One was on the coffee table with your lipstick and fingerprints on it. The other was shattered on the floor next to the drinks table. 

---

It had been ground nearly to dust. We found shards of the same glass embedded in your slippers.

---

## MARGOT
Yes, I stepped on it.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Did you intentionally crush that glass?

---

## MARGOT
Why would I do that?

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
To make sure no fingerprints could be retrieved from it.

---

So it wouldn’t look like you and Lesgate were having drinks just before you killed him.

---

## MARGOT
Why would I be having drinks with him in my nightgown?!

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
But you weren’t wearing a nightgown. When the police arrived, you were dressed in a blouse and slacks.

---

## MARGOT
I changed, that was after! Tony, tell him!

## TONY
Darling, what’s going on?

---

## MARGOT
The inspector’s trying to say I killed that man intentionally! It was self-defense!

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Unfortunately, there were no witnesses, so we've only your word.

---

## TONY
That’s not true, I heard it over the telephone.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
What exactly did you hear, Mr. Wendice?  Did you hear anything that indicated a struggle was going on?

---

## TONY
What I heard was consistent with my wife’s explanation.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
So all you really know is what your wife told you.

---

You suggest that this man came to burgle your flat, but there's no evidence of a burglary. He didn’t even have a bag to put things in.

---

You told us he came in by way of the garden, but we know he came in by the front door.

---

## MARGOT
But he can't have got in that way. That door was locked and there are only two keys. 

---

My husband had his with him and mine was in my handbag! Here!

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
You could have let him in.

---

## MAXINE
You're not suggesting that Margot let him in herself.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
It appears to be the only way he could have entered.

---

## MARGOT
Don't you even believe I was attacked? How do you think I got these bruises on my throat?

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
You could have caused those bruises yourself. 

---

A silk stocking was found under the desk, with two knots tied in it.

---

## MARGOT
That must have been the stocking he used.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
We found its twin balled up inside some crumpled paper at the bottom of your wastebasket. 

---

The paper was torn out of a magazine that was on your coffee table. 

---

Can you explain why your attacker should do that?

---

## MARGOT
..No.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Those stockings were yours, weren't they?

---

## MARGOT
No!

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
We know they were. One of the heels had been darned with some silk that didn't quite match. 

---

We found a reel of that silk in your mending basket.

---

## MARGOT
That’s because I was mending some… There was a pair of stockings in here, I’m sure of it..!

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Let’s take a wide view, shall we? Lesgate stole your handbag at Victoria Station and discovered the letter in it. He decided to --

---

## TONY
Hang on, what letter? What are you talking about?

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
The letter from Miss Hadley that Lesgate used to blackmail your wife. 

---

Mrs. Wendice paid him 5000 pounds for it, but he didn’t return the letter. 

---

You arranged to meet him here last night, which is why you elected not to join Miss Hadley and your husband at supper. 

---

You let Lesgate in through the front door. You gave him a drink. You argued. You killed him.

---

The story that he was a burglar who attacked you was sheer fabrication.

---

## MARGOT
… Tony --

---

## TONY
I’m telephoning our attorney. I've heard of police deliberately planting clues to make sure of a conviction, but really!

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Mr. Wendice --

## TONY
Your men were in here for hours last night!

---

They could easily have taken those stockings out of that basket and done whatever they wanted with them. 

---

They probably wiped the, the fella’s shoes on the front door mat as well!

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Mrs. Wendice, I must advise you anything you say -

## MARGOT
He said he’d been paid to murder me!

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Could you repeat that, please?

---

## MARGOT
Lesgate, the man who.. whoever he was, he said he’d been paid 5000 pounds to murder me! 

---

He offered to tell me who it was paid him if I gave him another 10,000 pounds!

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
“Another” 10,000?

---

## MARGOT
He said the radio was the alibi, then he put that stocking ‘round my neck to strangle me, and I stabbed him!

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
So, Lesgate never got the chance to tell you who paid him to kill you.

## MARGOT
... No.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Pity.

---

## MARGOT
It’s the truth! It’s what he --!

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Let’s go quietly, shall we, Mrs. Wendice? 

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Else I shall have to call for the constables.

---

---

## MAXINE
Margot. Your handbag.

---

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Mr. Wendice?

## TONY
Hm?

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Will you be joining..?

---

## TONY
Of course. Yes.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Ah. Just wondered.

---

[Dramatic Music]

---

## BBC NEWSREADER (over radio)
...The Home Secretary is at this hour deciding if there are sufficient grounds to justify a reprieve for Mrs. Margot Wendice.

---

At the Old Bailey last November, Mrs. Wendice was found guilty of murder and sentenced to death. 

---

The trial, which featured lurid revelations regarding Mrs. Wendice and a close female friend,

---

was notable for the accused’s claim that the murdered man had been paid to kill her by a person or persons unknown. 

---

The jury returned a verdict of guilty in under an hour.

---

---

[Tony whistles]

---

[phone rings]

---

## TONY
Maida Vale 0401 -- Yes? - Oh, Fitzgerald, yes, I’m glad you called.

---

If your paper wants to publish the letter I shall have to ask for five hundred pounds.

---

Yes, it is a lot of money, but the cost of my wife’s defense was very high. 

---

Yes, well, how would you like your wife's dirty laundry read by millions of people?

---

Yes, think it over, only I'm going away the day after tomorrow.

---

South America. I may never come back.

---

[front door buzzer]

---

## TONY
Excuse me, I shall have to ring you later. 

---

Come in.

---

## MAXINE
Have you heard anything?

---

## TONY
Your timing is impeccable. She’s at the Home Office. Our lawyer has taken her. 

---

He says the chances of the Home Secretary granting clemency are slim to none. 

---

I expect someone will call shortly with the decision.

---

## MAXINE
Why didn’t you go with her?

---

## TONY
She wouldn’t allow it. I wanted to go to the prison this morning to say good-bye, but she wouldn't see me.

---

## MAXINE
She’s bad at goodbyes.

---

## TONY
Have you seen or spoken to her?

---

## MAXINE
We haven’t said a word to each other since she was arrested.

---

## TONY
I suppose you’ll be going back to New York now. 

---

I must say, it’s been admirable of you, staying on after the trial, through the appeals, right to the end.

---

## MAXINE
I’m not much in demand at present.

---

## TONY
Yes. Rough stuff, your book being pulled. I suppose I should say I’m sorry.

---

All those copies they printed before the scandal hit, taken off to the warehouse to be pulped. 

---

Oh, I should’ve offered you a drink. Bourbon on the rocks?

---

## MAXINE
Yeah, sure.

---

## TONY
What will you do now? Write another thriller, or have you done with that?

---

I doubt I’d know how to sell it to the reading public. Not that I’d have to. I’m out of a job too, you know.

---

## MAXINE
Yes, but you don’t have to worry about being comfortable. Not after tomorrow morning. 

---

But I am working on something right now, since you ask.

---

## TONY
Is it a mystery?

---

## MAXINE
Yes and no. I’m teasing out the plot, but I don’t think some of it holds up. 

---

The story’s about a woman who kills a man to get back a letter from him. 

---

Only she doesn’t find it. Even though the police find it quick enough, in one of the dead man’s pockets.

---

If you had just killed a man to get a letter, wouldn’t you go through every one of his pockets to find it? 

---

I know I would. Especially if my husband was hurrying home from the BBC and he was the person I was trying to keep the letter from. Yet she doesn’t.

---

## TONY
You’re not taking into account panic.

---

## MAXINE
Oh, I’m allowing for panic, confusion, the race against the clock. 

---

According to the police, she had the presence of mind amid all that to find a stocking, tie knots in it, then hide its mate.

---

If she had the presence of mind to do all that, why didn’t she have the presence of mind to find the letter? 

---

Then there are the stockings. She comes up with the idea to make it look like Lesgate used one of her stockings to strangle her. 

---

But then she’s got the matching stocking to deal with.

---

She can’t leave it in the mending basket, it’s the matching stocking that proves the other stocking is hers. 

---

She should destroy it. But she doesn’t. She hides it in the wastebasket. Badly. So badly the police couldn’t possibly overlook it. 

---

When the simplest and by far fastest way to get rid of that stocking in an instant would have been to..?

---

## TONY
What?

---

## MAXINE
Put a match to it. The stocking would have gone up in a flash. Poof.

---

## TONY
Would it?

---

## MAXINE
Any woman knows that. Men don’t though.

---

## TONY
No, I suppose we don’t.

---

## MAXINE
I want to show you something.

---

## TONY
It’s the blackmail note.

---

## MAXINE
The second one. Margot gave both of them to me.

---

## TONY
At the trial, you testified that you couldn’t find the second one.

---

## MAXINE
I lied. I kept thinking it was a clue, that it would lead to something.

---

I even went to the address on it, 23 Newport Street --

---

## TONY
So did the police. They turned up nothing.

---

## MAXINE
I know, but I still figured I could find a use for it. And I have.

---

My fingerprints are on that note. So are Margot’s. And now so are yours.

---

## TONY
What do you plan to do with it?

---

## MAXINE
Tell the police I found it in a pocket. My fingerprints and Margot’s are on it because she showed it to me.

---

Both of us testified to that. But your fingerprints are on the blackmail note because...

---

## TONY
Yes?

---

## MAXINE
You wrote it, you sent it to Margot, you were the blackmailer, not Lesgate.

---

## TONY
So. What’s the deal? I go to the police and confess, or you’ll give them that note with my prints on it? 

---

I’m not sure I see the advantage. If you give that note to the police, you implicate me.

---

If I confess to the police, I implicate myself. Either way, I lose.

---

## MAXINE
That isn’t the deal.

---

## TONY
What is it, then?

---

## MAXINE
I give this note to the police, or you give me half of Margot’s money.

---

## TONY
Oh.

---

## MAXINE
As you said, my book’s rotting in a warehouse waiting to be pulped.

---

No respectable publisher will give me a tumble now, not after that trial. 

---

Oh, I might be able to write under a pen name, in a few years, but not for the kind of money 

---

I would have made if “Your Death is Necessary” had been a best seller. And it would have been a best seller.

---

## TONY
Would have been, yes.

---

## MAXINE
So, you see, I could use a bit of money about now.

---

## TONY
Yes, but for you to get that money, I have to get that money, which means Margot has to be executed.

---

## MAXINE
She does, yes.

---

But do you know what I find interesting? You’re not arguing the point. You’re not saying you didn’t hire Lesgate to kill Margot.

---

## TONY
I don’t think it necessary. As far as I can tell, you’ve ginned-up the same hysterical story Margot told when she was arrested, 

---

only with me as the villain instead of you. The police didn’t believe it then, neither did the jury.

---

## MAXINE
No, they thought it was a desperate ploy by an unstable woman.

---

## TONY
More to the point, there was no evidence to back it up.

---

## MAXINE
There is now.

---

[Front door buzzes]

---

---

## TONY (offstage)
Inspector.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD (offstage)
Mr. Wendice. Sorry to disturb you. May I come in?

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Miss Hadley.

## MAXINE
Inspector.

---

## TONY
Maxine, tell Inspector Hubbard about the blackmail note.

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Blackmail note?

---

## TONY
Yes, show it to the inspector, will you?

---

## TONY 
Oh, dear. Now I’ve got my fingerprints on it. Sorry.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
How did you get this?

---

## MAXINE
I found it.

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
When?

---

## MAXINE
Today.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Where?

## TONY
In a pocket. Isn’t that what you said, Maxine?

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
You testified at the trial that you made a thorough search for that second note.

---

## MAXINE
I thought I had.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
But when you find it today, you come to show it to Mr. Wendice. I wouldn’t have thought the two of you would be so chummy.

---

## TONY
We’re old friends regardless.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Yes. Artistic people.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD 
This note is very similar to the first note. I’m not sure what it adds.

---

## MAXINE
Inspector, / I --

## TONY
/ Before you came, Inspector, Miss Hadley was spinning a story. 

---

Apparently I paid Lesgate to murder my wife because I was driven to homicidal fury by the relationship detailed in Miss Hadley’s letter.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Yes, the letter.

---

## MAXINE
The way all of you go on about “the letter”, like little boys with a dirty magazine.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Some of it was rather graphic.

---

## TONY
It certainly didn’t help Margot’s case.

---

## MAXINE
Margot’s case came down to three things: the letter, the stocking, and the key. 

---

Lesgate is supposed to have been blackmailing her because my letter was found in his pocket. 

---

But what if it was Tony who was blackmailing her? What if it was Tony who stole her handbag?

---

## TONY
Why should I do that?

---

## MAXINE
You wanted to find out who was writing to her. When it turned out it was me, you plotted your revenge.

---

## TONY
But the letter was found in Lesgate’s pocket.

---

## MAXINE
You could have planted it on him.

## TONY
When did I do this?

---

## MAXINE
After you returned from the studio and before the police arrived.

---

## TONY
And how does my revenge plot fit into this?

---

## MAXINE
Oh, the revenge plot was the original plot. Lesgate was supposed to murder Margot.

---

## TONY
And how did I persuade Lesgate to commit this murder he didn’t commit?

---

## MAXINE
With the 5000 pounds Margot paid for the letter you didn’t return.

---

## TONY
I see. Right, so, that’s the letter. What about the key? Miss Hadley does this for a living.

---

## MAXINE
You told Lesgate you’d hide your key outside the flat. Above the door or under a pot, somewhere. 

---
## MAXINE
Lesgate let himself in, then when you phoned / from --

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
/Miss Hadley, 

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
if Lesgate had used Mr. Wendice's key, it would still have been on him when he died. 

---

Besides, how did Mr. Wendice get in when he returned?

---

## MAXINE
Margot could have let Tony in.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
But Mrs. Wendice didn’t let her husband in. He let himself in with his own key. Both of them testified to that.

---

## TONY
Your move, Max.

---

## MAXINE
Lesgate could have taken the key from wherever Tony hid it, unlocked the door, then returned it to its hiding place before he came in.

---

## TONY
You know, all this sounds terribly involved, I must have been *planning it for years. *

---

## MAXINE
One year. Since you discovered Margot and I were lovers.

---

## TONY
Maxine, I’m going to say something no one was ever supposed to know. When I came back here that night, 

---

I found Margot kneeling beside Lesgate’s body, going through his pockets. She kept saying he had something of hers. 

---

A letter. She was hysterical. I had to calm her down, so I pulled her away from the body,

---

which is when the police arrived. That’s why she didn’t retrieve the letter.

---

## MAXINE
And you’re telling this story just now?

---

## TONY
I seem to be.

---

Inspector, I suppose I’ve committed a crime, admitting that.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
All this has been out of my hands for months now. 

---

There's been a trial and an appeal and now the Home Office...

---

## MAXINE
What about the Home Office?

---

## TONY
Do you know if there’s been a decision?

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
It’s why I came. The Home Secretary has denied her request. The hanging will go forward tomorrow morning.

---

I’m very sorry, sir.

---

May I walk you out?

---

## MAXINE
You’ve been very clever, Tony. You plot like a master, and you improvise brilliantly. 

---

But you have made one mistake. Just now. What will happen when Margot hears about this?

---

## TONY
About..?

## MAXINE
Your story. Margot tearing through Lesgate’s pockets, trying to find the letter.

---

## TONY
She'll deny it.

---

## MAXINE
She'll change her will. You'll have done it all for nothing.

---

[door slams]

## TONY
Do you think they'll let her?

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Let..?

---

## TONY
Let Maxine see Margot. Can she be kept from visiting her in prison? I don’t want my wife to be made upset.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Your wife isn’t at the prison. She’s likely to have just left the Home Office.

---

## TONY
Oh, yes, right. But once she’s back...

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Tell you what: I’ll ring up the warden and put a word in his ear.

---

Stop Miss Hadley from making a scene.

---

## TONY
Thank you, Inspector. You’re very kind.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Not at all, sir. Oh, by the way, there are items belonging to Mrs. Wendice at the police station. 

---

Her gloves, handbag. You’re to come and collect them today.

---

## TONY
Can’t they be sent here?

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
I’m afraid not. They have to be signed for in front of the Desk Sergeant.

---

## TONY
Must it be today?

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
I’m afraid so, sir.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Is this yours?

## TONY
What is it?

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Somebody's latchkey. It was lying on the floor, just here.

---

## TONY
No. I've got mine here.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Must be mine, then.

---

Yes, it is. It must have dropped out of my pocket. There's a small hole here.

---

That's the trouble with those keys, they're all alike.

---

Good-bye, Mr. Wendice. I don't suppose we shall meet again.

---

## TONY
No. I suppose not. Again, thank you.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Yes, sir. I’ll see myself out.

---

---

## TONY
Hullo, Fitzgerald? -- Tony Wendice. -- You have, eh? Well, I’m afraid the price has gone up. 

---

I want 1,000 pounds. – I know what I said earlier, but I’m raising it.

---

I want your answer now, yes or no. -- I thought you’d see reason. 

---

[Front door buzzes]

---

## TONY
Send the cheque in care of my attorney. He’ll see the letter’s delivered into your grubby little hands.

---

[Front door buzzes]

---

## TONY
Yes, you too, goodbye.

---

[Sound of urgent knocking.]

---

## MARGOT
May I have some water? Please?

---

---

## MARGOT
We were at the Home Office. They'd taken me there from my cell just after breakfast. 

---

I was kept in a room while they discussed the case. 

---

I sat there, thinking “They’re not going to hang me tomorrow, they can't possibly. The Home Secretary won't allow it.”

---

Then the door opened, and they told me to come in. My solicitor wouldn't look at me.

---

The Home Secretary was very brisk, very efficient. “Clemency denied.” 

---

But I suppose that was too efficient because he added that only a brazen woman would have the nerve to request clemency after such a sordid trial,

---

called me wanton, a degenerate. Then it was over. My solicitor still refused to look at me. 

---

They took me back to the car. I got in the backseat. There were only two guards, one in front to drive, the other in the back with me.

---

“They're going to hang me tomorrow. They're going to hang me and no one will help.” 

---

And then I noticed.. the door was unlocked. 

---

They have no problem believing a woman’s capable of committing murder in cold blood

---

but not that she’d try to escape when she's to be hanged the next morning. 

---

The car pulled away and started back to the prison. The streets were crowded. Traffic.

---

“They're going to hang me tomorrow, they're going to hang me..” I kept looking at the lock on the door,

---

thinking one of them's got to notice, the guard sitting next to me will see, he’ll reach over and lock it.

---

But he didn't. We stopped at a light. Regent’s Park. It was my only chance. I grabbed the door handle, pulled. 

---

And I ran, ran across the park.

---

## TONY
Why in God’s name did you come here?

---

## MARGOT
Where else could I go? Please, for God's sake, you've got to help me! Tony, say some --

---

[The phone rings]

---

## MARGOT 
What if it's the police?

---

## TONY
Hello. -- Yes, sergeant, the inspector told me. Is it really necessary that I come pick them up today?

---

No, no, I’ll be right there.

---

That was the police station. They have your handbag and other things to be picked up, they want me to come get them.

---

## MARGOT
They didn’t say anything about me?

---

## TONY
It appears word hasn’t reached them yet.

---

## MARGOT
Tony--

[Tony shushes Margot]

---

## TONY
I’m improvising. We’ve got to get you away. We’ll get you out of the country. 

---

The car’s in the garage at the corner. I’ll bring it round and drive us to Portsmouth. Peggy’s boat is docked there.

---

## MARGOT
How are we to manage a 55 foot yacht?

---

## TONY
Peggy has a captain. We’ll pay him however much he wants. 

---

If the police ask, he can pretend he didn’t know who we were.

---

## MARGOT
But, / Tony --

## TONY
/Darling, it’s our only chance, they are going to hang you tomorrow!

---

## TONY
Now, I’m going to go and bring round the car. It shouldn’t take more than five minutes.

---

## MARGOT
Shouldn’t I go with you?

## TONY
No, you might be seen. 

---

## TONY
Stay here. Don’t answer the phone, don’t answer the door. Promise?

---

## MARGOT
I won’t.

---

[door slams]

---

[music]

---

[Sound of a key in the front door]

[Margot Gasps]

---

## MAXINE
Margot? What the hell are you doing here?

---

## MARGOT
You first.

---

## MAXINE
I should think you’d be tired of asking house breakers what they’re doing in your flat.

---

## MARGOT
I ran away.

---

## MAXINE
Does Tony know?

---

## MARGOT
Tony’s getting me out of the country. We’re driving to Portsmouth. He’s gone for the car. He’ll be back in a minute.

---

## MAXINE
My God.

[Door opens]

---

## MARGOT
Who’s with you?

[Footsteps approach]

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Mrs. Wendice?

---

## MARGOT
I got away.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
You did, eh? Well. Somebody will be given a very strong talking to. But never mind about that now.

---

## MARGOT
Aren’t you going to arrest me?

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
You will be doing us all, especially yourself, a great deal of good by keeping quiet and behaving as you’re told.

---

## MAXINE
Let’s get you / into --

## MARGOT
/No! Tell me what’s going on! Especially as this isn’t the first time you’ve been here today.

---

That’s your color. The ice hasn’t even melted yet. What were you doing?

---

## MAXINE
Trying to save your life.

---

## MARGOT
By having cocktails with my husband?

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
By trying to blackmail him. Not that it worked. Told you it wouldn’t.

---

## MAXINE
It was worth a try! I thought if I could get Tony’s fingerprints on the blackmail note, 

---

he would pay me not to give it to the police. If he did that, it would be as good as a confession.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
But he didn’t, and it wasn’t a confession.

---

## MARGOT
What /do --?

[footsteps approaching]

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Quiet now!

---

[Sound of a key in the front door, the key doesn't fit]

---

[Front door buzzes]

---

[Door buzzes again]

---

[Knocking on the front door]

---

[knocking continues, more urgently]

---

[Footsteps leaving]

---

## MARGOT
Who was that?

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
That was your husband.

---

## MARGOT
Tony? But.. why couldn’t he get in?

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
He hasn’t got his key.

---

## MARGOT
But he took his...he took his raincoat, he always keeps his key in the pocket.

---

Why wouldn’t you let me answer the door?

---

## MAXINE
What did he say when he left?

---

## MARGOT
He told me to keep out of sight, don’t open the door, don’t answer the phone.

---

## MAXINE
Then he thinks you’re just following his instructions.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Now he’s gone to the police station where he knows your handbag is waiting, and in it, your key.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Hubbard here. -- He's realized about his raincoat. --He came back and couldn't get in.

---

He's probably on his way to the station now. Give Wendice those gloves and the handbag and make sure he sees the key inside the bag.

---

Better make him check the contents and sign for it. If he wants his own key and raincoat, tell him I've gone to Glasgow.

---

Call me back when he leaves the station.

---

## MARGOT
Why do you think Tony’s gone to the police station?

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Because he’s realized he picked up the wrong coat with the wrong key.

---

## MARGOT
I don’t understand.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Mrs. Wendice, what I've got to tell you may come as a shock. 

---

We strongly suspect that your husband plotted to murder you.

---

## MARGOT
How long have you suspected this?

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Miss Hadley came to me this morning with, what did you call it, a plot snag?

---

## MAXINE
The key. Call it my writerly obsession with tying up loose ends. It always bothered me that no key was found on Lesgate's body. 

---

Not even a key to his flat. Most people carry a key on them. 

---

Why didn’t the police find one on Lesgate? So I went to see the inspector.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Miss Hadley seemed to be accusing Scotland Yard of doing a poor job.

---

Well, I couldn’t let that stand, so I decided to search this flat one more time, to see if I could find Lesgate’s key. 

---

It could have fallen out during the struggle and ended up somewhere we hadn’t looked, in the gap between two floor planks, behind a baseboard.

---

But first I had to gain access to the flat. So I went to the station, got your handbag and lifted the key.

---

## MAXINE
Stole it.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Then I waited until Mr. Wendice had gone out this morning and tried to get in.

## MARGOT
Tried?

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
I never got in. The key I’d stolen from your handbag didn't fit the lock.

---

## MARGOT
Why? Has Tony changed the locks?

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
No.

---

## MAXINE
It wasn’t your key.

---

## MARGOT
Where’s my key then?

---

## MAXINE
It took me just half an hour to find it. It was hidden under the fifth stair carpet in the entry hall.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Wendice told Lesgate that he would leave your key under the stair carpet and to return it to the same place when he left.

---

But as Lesgate was killed, Wendice naturally assumed your key would still be in one of Lesgate's pockets. 

---

That was his mistake. Because Lesgate had done exactly what Miss Hadley suggested. 

---

He unlocked the front door, and then returned the key before he came in.

---

## MARGOT
And it's been out there in the hall ever since?

---

## MAXINE
It’s still there.

---

## MARGOT
So the key Tony took out of Lesgate's pocket and put in my handbag was...

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Lesgate's own key!

---

## MAXINE
We took the key that was in your handbag to a Mrs. Van Dorn's this morning. 

---

It unlocked the door to Lesgate’s flat.

---

## MARGOT
Does this mean I’m free?

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Actually, no, this is all supposition.

---

## MARGOT
What?

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Yes, I’m afraid we’ve yet to prove any of this.

---

[Phone rings]

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD 
Right, start the ball rolling. Mr. Wendice just left the station with your handbag. He’s on his way back.

---

## MARGOT
Did he tell them I was here?

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
He’s smarter than that. He knows that if the police come bursting in, you’d know it was him who tipped us off and change your will first thing. 

---

When he returns, he’ll try the key from your handbag.

---

When that key doesn't fit he'll realize his mistake, put two and two together and look under the stair carpet.

---

## MARGOT
But if he doesn't get that key, you can't prove a thing.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
True. But if he opens that door, we shall know everything.

---

[Sound of three thumps above]

---

## MARGOT
What’s that?

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
My men upstairs. There are two up top and three on the street.

---

[Phone rings]

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Quiet now. He’s returned.

---

## MARGOT
What if you’re lying.

## MAXINE
What?

---

## MARGOT
What if this, everything you’ve been saying is just to keep me here until more police come and arrest me.

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
There aren’t more police coming to arrest / you ..

## MARGOT
/You said you’ve got men up top, men in the streets! 

---

## MARGOT
Maybe this is all just another lie!

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
Mrs. Wendice --!

---

## MAXINE
Margot, for Christ’s sake!

---

[Footsteps approaching]

## MAXINE 
Shh!

---

## INSPECTOR HUBBARD
What do you think you’re doing?

## MAXINE
Margot, please!

---

## MARGOT
Do you want me to hang? Tony’s driving me to Portsmouth!

---

## MAXINE
You’ll never reach Portsmouth! He’s probably planning on running a traffic light that’ll make a constable stop the car!

---

That or a road accident, the kind the driver survives and the passenger doesn’t!

---

## MARGOT
No. No, Tony doesn’t think that way. You’re the one who thinks that way!

---

[Key is inserted into the front door lock. It doesn’t fit]

---

[Front door buzzer]

## MARGOT 
I’ve got to open the door!

---

[Front door buzzes, repeatedly]

---

## TONY
Margot!

## MAXINE
Margot, don’t!

---

## TONY 
Margot, open the door!

---

## MARGOT
Why should I trust you?

---

## MAXINE
You...you know why.

---

[Tony bangs on the door]

---

## TONY 
Margot, it’s Tony!

---

[Tony continues to bang on the door]

---

[Sound of key being inserted into the door. Sound of lock turning]

---

[Door opens]

[Dramatic music]

---

[Front door slams]

---
