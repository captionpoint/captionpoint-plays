You said we go home together.

## NUMBER FOUR:
You still think I am spy?

---

## LUKE:
No, of course not.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
Then why I am being sent to prison in China?

---

## LUKE:
It’s not prison, it’s a camp, with other stragglers of the war, it’s complicated.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
What about baby?

---

## LUKE:
The truck will take you to the China–Burma border.
They’ve prepared a package for all the girls. Food and supplies, even. Just add your stuff in.

Is this everything?

## NUMBER FOUR:
This is yours.

---

## LUKE:
Keep it.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
Why?

---

## LUKE:
Or chuck it.
Do what you want I don’t want it.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
What about baby.

---

## LUKE:
You can probably get some extra supplies for –

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
Chuck baby too? Baby never in any army.

You take her. You take your baby home.

## LUKE:
I can’t.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
Then she will die.

---

## LUKE:
Better off with the mother.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
In prison?

---

## LUKE:
It’s not –

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
I cannot be mother, she will die.

You want her die, we do it now.

---

## LUKE:
What are you – are you nuts?

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
Yes. Nuts. How do nuts take her home?

---

## LUKE:
I can’t raise a child on my own.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
Me too.

---

## LUKE:
Take her.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
No.

---

## LUKE:
Take her. I will come and find you, later.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
You said it is complicated.

---

## LUKE:
So, later. When it’s less complicated. When I’m ready. I will come and find you and bring you back.

What’s her name?

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
Baby.

---

## LUKE:
Still no name?

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
Baby good enough for complicated times.

---

## LUKE:
Anastasia.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
Anas– Why?

## LUKE:
Means, one who shall rise again.

We meet on today, a year from now.

---

## LUKE:

## ANA:

## ANA:
What does this say? Can you read it? It’s not English.

## JESUS:
That, is a series of numbers.
Possibly a phone number.

---

And that, is not English.

Possibly Korean.

---

## ANA:
So you can’t read it?

---

## JESUS:
Wild guess, name and number.

---

## ANA:
Whose?

---

## JESUS:
Great Question.

---

## ANA:
Was he sickly, or pale, or suicidal looking? The man who gave this to you?

---

## JESUS:
Not really? He was pretty nice, tipped well. Had a scruffy beard, nice teeth, oh and a little limp on the left leg.

---

Right leg? Left leg.

---

Right leg?

---

## ANA:
Right.

---

## JESUS:
Right on.
Are you looking for him or something? I could go ask the front desk girls for more info–

---

## ANA:
I know where he is.

---

## JESUS:
Oh woah.

He looked totally fine. Wow.

Sorry.

---

## ANA:
I’m not.

## ANA:
Sorry.

---

## JESUS:
Right on.

---

Okay look, I don’t do this for everyone but, if you wanted something to mellow out a bit,

---

## ANA:
Oh, I don’t really do that anymore.

---

## JESUS:
You’ve never done these before, man, authentic Korean grass from the mountaintops of Fuji.

---

## ANA:
Pretty sure Fuji’s in Japan,

---

## JESUS:
Okay, Rand McNally.

---

One for you, one for dear diary.

Just ring if you need anything else. Okay? 
Have a good night Miss Woods.

---

## ANA:
“June 17, 1944.

Abandoned.

No sight of friendlies for days."

---

"Laying low in abandoned village near the River Ayeyawady, scrapped what food I could but it’s not looking good."

---

"Enemy base must be close.

Had a near encounter at sundown.

At first I thought they were just out on patrol but –”

---

## LUKE:
I’m dead.

---

## JESUS:
Shh.

---

## LUKE:
How many are there? I can’t even, I’m dead.

I’mdeadI’mdead.

---

## JESUS:
Don’t panic.
They can’t see you from there.

---

## ANA:
“I could smell them from here.
The sweat.
The lust, in enemy uniform.”

---

## LUKE:
Six guys to a girl.

---

Stop it.
Can’t you stop it?

---

## JESUS:
You stop it.

Is your rifle loaded?

---

## LUKE:
No!

---

## JESUS:
Then load up.

---

## LUKE:
I can’t, they’ll hear me.

---

## ANA:
“When the first guy was done he threw her on her back.
The rest of them got into a line.
She was kicking, crying.”

---

## LUKE:
She’s a kid.
She’s like twelve.

---

## ANA:
“Six of them, one of me.”

---

## JESUS:
You’ve got visual, they don’t.

---

## ANA:
“It was impossible.”

---

## LUKE:
I’m not putting my ass on the line for some Oriental kid,

---

## JESUS:
So what are you asking me to do?

---

## ANA:
“Every bullet I shoot away could be the difference between my own life or death.”

---

## LUKE:
I can’t.

---

## JESUS:
You won’t know till you try.

---

## LUKE:
You’re the god, you fucking try.

---

## ANA:
“And suddenly the bald guy, sort of the leader type, he takes a knife, slits her stomach, sits her up against the wall and salutes.”

---

## LUKE:
Do something!

---

## ANA:
“The other guys laugh.”

---

## JESUS:
I’m not some Voodoo doll to call upon whenever you want to punish your foes –

---

## LUKE:
I can’t believe You are letting this happen.

---

## JESUS:
Me? You’re the one that volunteered for this mess.
You’re the one hiding behind a wall.

---

## ANA:
“Another guy steps in, takes the stiletto from the bald guy, sticks the whole damn blade into her –”

---

## LUKE:
Jesus!

---

## JESUS:
Luke.
Hey.
It’s okay.
They’ve gone.

---

## LUKE:
Is she…

---

## JESUS:
Still there.

---

## LUKE:
Alive?

---

## JESUS:
Yes.

---

## LUKE:
Is she hurting?

---

## JESUS:
What do you think?

---

## LUKE:
They’ll find me, they’ll find the shell and come looking.

---

## JESUS:
You don’t have to shoot her.

---

## LUKE:
I can’t do this.

---

## JESUS:
Go down, see what’s going on, see if there’s –

---

## LUKE:
I need a minute.

---

## JESUS:
Right.
Why put your ass on the line for some Oriental kid.
I get it.

---

## ANA:
“I went down with my stiletto in hand.

---

Her eyes were still alive.
Watery eyes, like skinned grapes.
Pleading.

---

She looked so scared.

---

I covered her bleeding body, found the artery in her neck, and cut as quick and deep as I could.
Held her hand till the heart stopped.

---

She had a tag around her neck.
I pulled it out and tucked it into my pocket.

---

And I don’t know why but –” Oh woah.

---

## LUKE:
I kissed her.

---

No breath, but still warm lips.
It’s disgusting but –

---

## ANA:
Really? I am all the way in South Fucking Korea so I can read about how you fucked around kissing dead girls in a war you didn’t fucking need to be in Fuck You.
I’m done.

---

## ANA:
I am done wanting to know things about you.

---

I will haul your ashy ass back to the States, which is more offspring duty than you ever deserved 
and then you and me are done for good because I just don’t want to know.

---

And Fuck You Too.

---

Hello tiny fridge.

---

Thank you tiny fridge.

---

Do you have any yummy snacks tiny fridge?

## JESUS:

## ANA:

---

## LUKE:
The fuck is going on?

---

## ANA:

---

## LUKE:

## JESUS:

---

She’s found the SPAM.

## ANA:

## NUMBER FOUR:
What you want?

---

## JESUS:
Here to help you out.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
I don’t need your help.

---

## JESUS:
Okay then here to deliver a message, they’re gonna blow up the bridge.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
I know.
It is bluffing.
Rumor.

---

## JESUS:
What if it is not?

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
They would never do that,

---

## JESUS:
Okay so, North Side has jumped the thirty-eighth parallel, all but taken Seoul, EVACUATE EVACUATE!

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
Is the rumor.

---

## JESUS:
Remember that little black car with dark windows that crossed over a few hours ago? That was your president.
He’s high-tailing it outta here.
As should we.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
He just announced on city speakers.
Everything is okay.

---

## JESUS:
Okay but so, I usually tend to be righter than the speakers.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
You are wrong.

---

## JESUS:
I am God.
I am never wrong.

---

Okay, that’s not gonna work on you right now, I see
that.
But, it would be better to see if I’m right or wrong about the bombing of the bridge, say, not on the bridge.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
I am waiting for Luke.

---

## JESUS:
It’s been four years, I think a few days’ break wouldn’t hurt? Stretch a little, get some food, stay alive.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
What if he comes when I leave?

---

## JESUS:
What if he comes when you are dead?

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
I think I choose dead over leaving.

---

## JESUS:
Oh man you are so much work.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
You really this guy?

---

## JESUS:
Yup.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
And I am not crazy?

---

## JESUS:
Depends on what you mean by crazy.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
Are you something I make in my head?

---

## JESUS:
No.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
Why you here?

---

## JESUS:
Oh you know, just hanging around.

---

Get it? With the hanging, like on your thing, nevermind.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
You are here to tell me, he is coming.

---

## JESUS:
Not exactly.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
You are here to tell me, he is not coming.

---

## JESUS:
I am here because, you remembered I was.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
I don’t trust speakers.

## JESUS:
Awesome.

## NUMBER FOUR:
But I don’t trust you either.

---

## JESUS:
Not awesome.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
And I don’t want to leave.

---

## JESUS:
Okay then.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
Okay then?

---

## JESUS:
We’ll sit here and wait for Luke slash be bombed into the river.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
You will stay?

## ANA:
“June 19.
I’m still here.
Not dead.
Yet.”

---

## LUKE:
What was that?

---

## ANA:
“Don’t know which way to head.
Which way is closer or further away from danger?”

---

## LUKE:
Stay there.
Shh.

---

## ANA:
“The girl is still here too.”

---

## JESUS:
I don’t know why you insist on keeping her a hostage.

---

## ANA:
“It’s comforting.
To have another body.
To hear another’s breath.”

---

## LUKE:
I’m not keeping her hostage.

---

## JESUS:
Yes you are.
What do you want from her Luke?

---

## LUKE:
Nothing.

---

It’s just, I don’t know you aren’t gonna run back and rat me out.

---

## ANA:
She says she’s running away, “I run away from Japanese.”

---

## LUKE:
But you are still their soldier.

---

## ANA:
“No.”

---

## LUKE:
Your uniform –

---

## ANA:
“I steal the clothes. To run.”

---

## LUKE:
I’ve no proof of –

---

## ANA:
“If you want proof I can show you.” Holy Crap what the hell?!

---

## JESUS:
Oh woah!

---

## LUKE:
No, don’t, please.

---

## ANA:
I’m not doing, it’s just happening.

---

## JESUS:
Oh boy.

---

## LUKE:
No! Look, just, I don’t want you to, Stop.

---

## ANA:
Thank God.

---

## JESUS:
You’re so welcome.

---

## LUKE:
That’s not why I’m keeping her.

---

## JESUS:
I didn’t say anything.

---

## LUKE:
I’m not going to be seduced.

---

## ANA:
What?

---

## LUKE:
I’m just not that kind of person.

---

## JESUS:
What kind of person?

---

## LUKE:
I don’t need That kind of – thing.
From you.
It’s indecent.

---

## JESUS:
Who’s giving you any kind of “that kind of thing”?

---

## ANA:
“I am indecent?” she asked.

---

## JESUS:
That’s a lot of judgment from someone who was making out with a dead girl.

---

## LUKE:
No.
I mean, it’s war.
No one’s decent.

---

## ANA:
“I was told I was going to shoe factory in China.
We do not Choose to be indecent.
My sister, she was not even tricked, she was just kidnapped from the street.”

---

## LUKE:
Sister? Is she here, in Burma too?

---

## ANA:
“Yes.
She was in the truck of new girls last week.
When I see it is her, that is when I made plan to escape.”

---

## LUKE:
Where is she?

---

## ANA:
“I don’t know. She is lost.
She is lost when we run away.”

---

## LUKE:
Older or younger?

---

## ANA:
“She is younger, just twelve.”

---

## JESUS:
Ah shit.
Dead girl was her sister?

---

## LUKE:
She was also…a…what you are? She was, wearing the same, as you?

---

## ANA:
“Yes! Same as me! You see her? She is shorter than me.
Longer hair, and same Japanese soldier clothes.
You see her?”

---

## LUKE:
I, not sure.

---

## JESUS:
Yes we did?

---

## LUKE:
How long were you out here, before we met?

---

## ANA:
“We left the Japanese camp a day before, and separated when the men came after us.”

---

## LUKE:
We are only a day’s walk from enemy base?

---

## ANA:
“Yes.”

---

## JESUS:
That’s bad.

---

## LUKE:
That’s bad.

---

## ANA:
“Yes.”

---

## LUKE:
Do you remember which way they are located?

---

## ANA:
“If I help you, will you help us?”

---

## LUKE:
Help me? How will you help me?

---

## ANA:
“I live here for nearly two years. I know locations.”

---

## LUKE:
Even if you find her, where would you go?

---

## ANA:
“I don’t know.
For protection, maybe we find British Army.
You are British Army?”

---

## LUKE:
No, I am, volunteer from USA.
Special unit.
But I guess yeah sort of the British Army.

---

## ANA:
“Then you can help us? You can take us home?”

---

## LUKE:
What’s that?

---

## ANA:
Someone’s here.

---

“The shot coming from below.
Two o’clock.
We have advantage.
Your rifle is good?”

---

## LUKE:
I don’t wanna die I don’t wanna die I don’t wanna die.

---

## JESUS:
No no, don’t space out now,

---

## ANA:
There is so much more journal left you didn’t die here, we made it out.

---

## LUKE:
The Lord is my shepherd I shall not want,

---

## JESUS:
Luke, no, look at me.

---

## ANA:
Come on Dad get up get up – AAHA Fuck me come ON!

---

## LUKE:
He makes me to lie down in green pastures,

---

## JESUS:
Hey hey come on.

---

## LUKE:
He leads me beside the still waters, He restores my soul, He leads me in the paths of
righteousness for His name’s sake.

---

## JESUS:
Luke, hey man, hold yourself together.

---

## ANA:
“Please, hello, give me knife?” The knife, get the knife, give her the fucking knife,

---

## LUKE:
Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,

---

## ANA:
Woods wake the fuck up.

---

## JESUS:
Come back to us Luke.

---

## LUKE:
I will fear no evil,

---

## ANA:
Okay, okay, I got the gun I got the gun now what?

---

## LUKE:
For thou art with me thy rod and staff they comfort me,

---

## JESUS:
Reciting poems won’t help you right now, hey, hello? Oh my god.

---

## LUKE:
Have mercy upon me o lord for I am weak,

---

## JESUS:
She said two o’clock,

---

## ANA:
What’s at two o’clock?

---

## LUKE:
Among the dead no one proclaims your name.
Who praises you from the grave? 

---

Am I dead?

---

## ANA:
“No.”

---

## LUKE:
I’m not dead?

---

## ANA:
“Alive.”

---

## LUKE:
Alive.

---

## ANA:
“You peepee your pants.”

---

## LUKE:
Everyone keeps dying.
Everyone keeps dying and I don’t.

---

## ANA:
“That is good thing.”

---

## LUKE:
Is it?

---

## ANA:
“Yes.”

---

## LUKE:
I’m scared.

---

## ANA:
“It’s okay.
It’s finished now.”

---

## LUKE:
Can you,

---

## ANA:
“Yes?”

---

## LUKE:
Hold me please?

---

## JESUS:
Luke.

---

## LUKE:
Please.

---

June 21, 1944.
No judgment.

---

## JESUS:
Luke.
What are you doing?

---

## LUKE:
No sense of right or wrong.
Just life.

---

## JESUS:
You’re better than this.

---

## LUKE:
Soft, warm, and tangible.

---

## JESUS:
This is not what she needs.
You know this is not what she –

---

## LUKE:
And now it’s all I can think about.

Come.
We have to get off the bridge.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
No.

---

## JESUS:
It’s blowing up!

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
No!

---

## LUKE:
June 28.
I see her eyes.
Same nightmare every night,

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
No no no no no no no no.

---

## LUKE:
I want to help, I want to pull the trigger, but I’m frozen.

---

## YOUNG SOLDIER:
[What are you doing there?]

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
[I’m not leaving!]

---

## LUKE:
I see her eyes.
Two skinned grapes, scared.
Begging.

---

## YOUNG SOLDIER:
[We’ve blown up the bridge, come with me!]

---

## LUKE:
But I do nothing.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
[Not leaving not leaving!]

---

## LUKE:
Her body is splayed across the earth,

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
[Let go!]

---

## LUKE:
And still they plow on.

---

## ANA:
What was that?

---

## LUKE:
And on,

---

## YOUNG SOLDIER:
[Do you want to die?]

---

## LUKE:
And on,

---

## YOUNG SOLDIER:
[Let me help you!]

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
[I don’t want to, no, let go!]

---

## LUKE:
And on.
And then I see their faces.

---

## ANA:
Holy shit!

---

## YOUNG SOLDIER:
[Here, get on my back!]

---

## LUKE:
They pull back and I see their faces.

---

## ANA:
Hello? Hello anyone out there?

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
[Let go let go let go let go!]

---

## ANA:
Help!

---

## LUKE:
And every face, is my face staring back,

---

## ANA:
Help! Help me!

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
[Let go let go let go let go!]

---

## LUKE:
Six devil mirrors grinning back at me, and I know it’s a dream it’s a dream it’s a dream,

---

## LUKE:
But I can’t wake up, lost, among the dead.

---

## SPEAKER:
Atten– guests – way as quick – safe – please – assist –

---

## JESUS:
Miss Woods! Miss Woods, are you there? Hello? Miss Woods?

---

## ANA:
Oh my god it’s you.

---

## JESUS:
Yup.
Me.

---

## ANA:
What’s today.

---

## JESUS:
Um…Tuesday? Wednesday?

---

## ANA:
February 13, 1975.
Confirm.

---

## JESUS:
Are you okay?

---

## ANA:
February 13, 1975.
Confirm.

---

## JESUS:
Yes.

---

## ANA:
We are in Seoul, South Korea.
Confirm.

---

## JESUS:
Yup.

---

## ANA:
My name is,

---

## JESUS:
Ana W–

---

## ANA:
Shit! My name is, Anastasia Woods Ana Woods Hi I’m Anayes.

---

It’s over.

---

Oh my god your drugs are Insanity.
Not in a good way.

---

## JESUS:
Ms. Woods, is everything alright?

---

## ANA:
Yes.
It’s great.
This is good.

---

I mean, except no, the phones don’t work, the door was jammed closed,

---

## JESUS:
Yeah, the city is enduring some serious riots, and –

---

## ANA:
Are they bombing the hotel? Are they angry at tourists? Are you here to evacuate me?

---

## JESUS:
Um, no, no one’s bombing anything,

---

## ANA:
But –

---

## JESUS:
Just yet, the students are swarming this way, the police are worse, they have gas grenades,

---

## ANA:
No bombing?

---

## JESUS:
We thought you folks on fifth floor would be fine, but with the kids, who knows what they’ll do, so we’re putting in some safety precautions.

---

## ANA:
No bombs.
At all?

---

## JESUS:
You sound disappointed, sorry Miss Woods if I could just sneak in front of you.

---

## ANA:
I’m losing my mind.

---

## JESUS:
Yeah you really picked a bad day to see the sights of Seoul.

---

## ANA:
I think I need to leave.

---

## JESUS:
Leave? Now? Hey woah wait it’s really not a fun crowd out there,

---

## ANA:
I’ve been in riots before I think I know how to handle it.

---

## JESUS:
I don’t think you get to handle anything as a non-Korean in a mob of angry Koreans.

---

## ANA:
I can’t stay.

---

## JESUS:
Why?

---

## ANA:
Unless will you stay? With me?

---

## JESUS:
Me?

---

## ANA:
Yes.

---

## JESUS:
In here?

---

## ANA:
Yes.

---

## JESUS:
Just us two?

---

## ANA:
Right.
You’re right.

---

Never mind.
I don’t know what I’m talking about.
Sorry.
I’ll be fine.

---

## JESUS:
Are you okay?

---

## ANA:
No, thank you.
It’s great.
It’s fine.
Bad dreams, mostly.

---

I’m fine.
I thought this had broken, but here you are.
You, too, are fine.

---

## JESUS:
What happened?

---

## ANA:
You know.
I don’t know what happened.
I just got a call and so I’m here.

---

Maybe he was dying, maybe he offed himself.
Who knows? I don’t.

---

Left me at Gran’s when I was barely five and went off to fight another war.
Any time he could he would be away.
Put me at Gran’s and went away.

---

He was in Vietnam for her funeral.
For my graduation.
Both of them.

---

Then he got sent back from Nam after some injury, I don’t know the details – you know, I was running around in tie-dye shirts with my peace flags against his flacks and machine guns.

---

Then he just up and left one day, disappeared without a word and then came back, in a box.

---

## JESUS:
Right on.

---

## ANA:
You weren’t asking about him, were you?

---

## JESUS:
Um, just, you were talking about something being broken, in the room,

---

## ANA:
Oh no nothing is broken.
I didn’t break anything.

---

I read the, and the guy, like I could hear him you know, and I burnt it, the journal, in there but then it reappeared in the fridge? With the SPAM? And he shot himself into pieces, the urn, not actual himself.
But somewhere a bomb went off and now it is fine.

---

As am I.
Also fine.
Sorry.
What’s it about? The riot.

---

## JESUS:
Freedom, democracy.
Hope for a new world.

---

## ANA:
After half a century of the same fight all over the world you think people would know better.

---

## JESUS:
Same fight, but new people.
I guess you gotta go through it yourself to actually know how it ends.

---

## ANA:
What if you don’t want to know how it ends? What if when you finally get some answers, you can sense that the ending that’s coming, really really just, clashes with your idea of what you are.

---

What if your idea of what you are was better than what you learn you actually are.

---

## JESUS:
Like how your idea of you as an orphan is better than learning that you are not an orphan, if the cost is learning the details of the “hows” and “whys” you are still unwanted regardless?

---

## ANA:
Yeah.
What?

---

## JESUS:
But he didn’t leave you his journal to do that to you, again.
I promise.

---

## ANA:
What? Did you know him? You knew my dad?

---

## JESUS:
Yes.
I did.

---

Okay all done.
That was a lot of work.
Please don’t walk into the mobs of angry Korean college kids.
Okay?

---

## ANA:
Who are you?

---

## JESUS:
Bellboy.
Sort of.

---

## ANA:
Hers?

---

## JESUS:
Yeah.

---

## ANA:
Did you do this?

---

## JESUS:
No.

---

## ANA:
The drugs again?

---

## JESUS:
No.

---

## ANA:
Was it me?

---

## JESUS:
Sort of.

---

## ANA:
Now what?

---

## JESUS:
Up to you.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
What happened?

---

## JESUS:
The bridge.
It fell.
And we’re falling with it.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
Am I dead?

---

## JESUS:
No.
We’re still falling.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
What about the soldier? Is he dead?

---

## JESUS:
No.
He made it off the bridge, south side.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
But I stab him.

---

## JESUS:
No.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
When he tried to carry me off bridge, I stab him.

---

## JESUS:
He ran when you took out the knife.
You stab me.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
I stab you? So the soldier, I did not kill him?

---

## JESUS:
You did not.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
This is very good news.

---

## JESUS:
I guess I’m glad it is good news for you that you stab me to bloody pulp, instead of that other guy who you didn’t know.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
It is good news, a little bit.
I’m sorry I stab you.

---

## JESUS:
Happens.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
Are you mad at me?

---

## JESUS:
No.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
I keep wanting to stab,

---

## JESUS:
I noticed.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
Everyone.
It is problem.

---

## JESUS:
Why?

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
Because it is bad thing to stab everyone.

---

## JESUS:
No, why do you want to?

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
If I knew why, why I live on bridge for four years? 
So long, this fall.

---

## JESUS:
People who come back from the dead say that the moment before death is very long.
A very clear and long panorama of all the events of one’s life.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
I am dying?

---

## JESUS:
You are falling.
Do you see all the events flashing before your eyes?

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
Not all.
Just one.

---

## LUKE:
You’re back.

---

## JESUS:
I had a feeling you’d go there.

---

## LUKE:
I’m glad you’re back.
I was worried.

---

## ANA:
Worried? Why?

---

## LUKE:
Because, you were here, and then not, and so I was worried about, what happened.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
I ran away while he was asleep.

---

## JESUS:
Was he being mean?

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
No.
He was nicer after I save his life.
But I had been with him many days.
And still we had not found sister.
So I left.

---

## LUKE:
What made you come back?
Did you miss me?

---

## ANA:
What is that?

---

## LUKE:
Dinner.
Hungry? It’s a fruit.

---

Go on.
Try it.

---

## ANA:
How do I know you’re not trying to poison me.

---

## LUKE:
Just try the damn fruit, huh? It’s good.

---

Okay fine.
Here.
See? Oh.

---

Oh woah.
Oh my gosh.
What is, I’m, I can’t, help help –

---

## ANA:
AAAAHHHH!!

---

## LUKE:
So good.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
And he tries so many ways to make me eat
his strange fruit but I don’t want to, because,

---

## JESUS:
Because it looked strange?

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
And poisonous.

---

## JESUS:
And you wanted to stay alive.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
For my sister.

---

## ANA:
You have eaten this before?

---

## LUKE:
No, but some other jungle fruits yes.

---

## ANA:
So you don’t really know? If it has poison or not.

---

## LUKE:
I guess not.
It’s a risk.

---

Death by ugly fruit.
Not the most ideal way to go, but between death by starvation or death by being shot in the face after excruciating torture? I’ll take it.

---

## ANA:
But remember about my sister.

---

## LUKE:
What? Remember what.

---

## ANA:
I have sister, I must find her, remember? Maybe my sister comes, looking for me and I
am dead and rotten?

---

## LUKE:
Maybe don’t talk about things like that.

---

## ANA:
Maybe you can have death by ugly fruit, but I have to be alive for her.

---

## LUKE:
Fine then fucking starve to death.
Your choice.

---

## JESUS:
Oy.
You know, he used to be such a gentle boy growing up.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
Every boy grows up to be not gentle.

---

## JESUS:
Not true.
I was the gentlest till the bitter end.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
And look where you end up.

---

## JESUS:
Nice one.
So back to you, in Burma, where it has now started to rain,

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
It is the monsoon rain.
Pouring.
We find shelter under rocks where the giant bugs are also staying.
After a long time, he says:

---

## LUKE:
I didn’t think you’d come back.
I woke up alone and I thought you had left.

---

## ANA:
I was lost.

---

## LUKE:
Why did you leave? Did I hurt you?

---

## ANA:
I was looking for my sister.

---

## LUKE:
Oh.
Did you? Find her?

---

## ANA:
No.

---

## LUKE:
Then why come back?

---

## ANA:
Maybe you can help me.

---

## LUKE:
I don’t know where she is.
I don’t even know where my base is.
I am not the best finder of things that need finding.

---

## ANA:
You are very good at hiding.
It was difficult to find you again.

---

## LUKE:
How did you then?

---

## ANA:
I found on floor.
And I know, you must be close, so I look for boot prints.
And bam! You are here with your poison fruits.

---

## LUKE:
If you found me so easy, guess it’s a matter of time before they do too.

---

## ANA:
No no, I am special.

---

## LUKE:
Yeah?

---

## ANA:
Yeah.
Maybe you leave me naked wood man, so I can use his magic powers to find you.

---

## JESUS:
You didn’t say that.
Did you really say that?

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
I think so? Maybe?

---

## JESUS:
Yeah then he probably came back with something snarky like:

---

## LUKE:
If that thing had any magic powers why would either of us even be here?

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
Are you guys fighting?

---

## JESUS:
I didn’t start it.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
Anyway, after I tell him how I find him he is scared again.
And I don’t like it.
Scared is contagious.

---

So I take a bite of his fruit and trick him to play my maybe game, like I did with the girls.

---

## ANA:
Maybe your fruit has magic powers too.
Maybe I eat your magic power fruit and stay strong.
So strong that maybe one day I will grow up and have many babies,

---

## LUKE:
Many babies?

---

## JESUS:
You like babies?

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
Of course and so I say yes maybe I will have at least eight babies.

---

## JESUS:
Oy.
You know they get more expensive in the future.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
I say maybe we will also have large stone house for us and babies, one with a real wood stove kitchen.
Everything is built with clay from Han River.

---

## ANA:
And in the kitchen today, our broth is boil boil boiling for the Solongtang.

---

## LUKE:
Solong what?

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
Solongtang, it is your favorite dish.
Noodles, vegetables and meat in a white broth pulled from bones of strong beef.
Maybe you are coming home so soon, so we are in hurry.

---

## LUKE:
Maybe I can’t raise eight kids on a writer’s salary.

---

## ANA:
Oh.
Six.
Three girl, three boy.

---

## LUKE:
Two.
One girl.

---

## ANA:
Four.

---

## LUKE:
Three, two girls one boy.
Final offer.

---

## ANA:
Deal.

---

## LUKE:
So maybe I come home after my daily eight hours of writing the next great American novel, back to our stone house with the clay stove, which is maybe in New York.

---

## ANA:
New York?

---

## JESUS:
Yeah, the guy is totally obsessed with New York.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
I know! He thinks,

---

## NUMBER FOUR & LUKE:
It’s the best city in the world.

---

## ANA:
Why? I want to live in Seoul.

---

## LUKE:
Maybe be quiet and let me finish my fantasy.

---

## ANA:
Okay.

---

## LUKE:
The kids run to my arms, because they know I picked up cheesecake from Veniero’s for dessert.

---

## JESUS:
What’s Veniero’s?

---

## NUMBER FOUR & LUKE:
The best cake shop in the world.

---

## JESUS:
Y’all need to get out more.

---

## LUKE:
“After dinner, kids,” I say.
Sternly, like a dad, but I wink and open the box for the little imps, and hope you won’t notice the four finger holes on the surface.

---

And then I see you in the hallway, flushed from the ovens and red clays, and I think, busted.
But then you slide over, oblivious and beautiful, smelling of Solo something

---

## NUMBER FOUR & ANA.
Solongtang.

---

## JESUS:
Oy white boys.

---

## LUKE:
Right.
I can never pronounce my favorite food which drives you crazy.
You come over, I peck you on the cheek,

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
And I say no, a little higher, actually, the spot between my ear and eye.
Where you like.

---

## LUKE:
Right here?

---

## ANA:
Yes.
Right there.

---

## JESUS:
That’s kinda cute.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
What happens next? I ask, and he says:

---

## LUKE:
Then…the radio starts playing

---

## ANA:
The radio? What radio?

---

## LUKE:
The one in our fancy living quarters, you had tuned to the swing station because you’ve just been solonging to the swinging, bambaramba bambaramaba bum bum bum.
Come on.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
And I say:

---

## NUMBER FOUR & ANA:
What is that I don’t do that.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
But he swing me around.

---

## LUKE:
Yeah you do.

---

## ANA:
Arraah!

---

## LUKE:
Then you pull away and say, “Well?” and I do the search, quick and frantic, is it your hair, dress, do you have a new shade of lipstick or mascara –

---

## ANA:
Wow.

---

## LUKE:
I too have a sister.

---

## ANA:
She teach you well.

---

## LUKE:
You have no idea.

---

## ANA:
So, what’s different with me?

---

## LUKE:
I get panicky, think I’m about to disappoint and…I see it.

---

## ANA:
What.
What is it?

---

## LUKE:
It’s a pair of teardrop earrings I gifted you the night before, on our tenth anniversary.

---

## ANA:
I wear the earrings for the rest of my life.

---

## LUKE:
Until, after a full long eighty plus year life, we are buried in the same graveyard.

---

## ANA:
Which is in Seoul.

---

## LUKE:
Which is in Kansas.

---

## ANA:
If our lived life was in your city, our dead life will be in mine.

---

## LUKE:
That’s fair.

---

Two daughters, one son, and two burial plots overlooking stretches of rice paddies in Seoul.

---

## ANA:
Do you promise?

---

## LUKE:
Huh?

---

## ANA:
What you say, of our life together?

---

## LUKE:
I promise.
If we make it out of here, I’ll take care of you.

---

## ANA:
And my sister?

---

## LUKE:
What?

---

## ANA:
If we make it out, you will help me find sister, and you will keep us safe?

---

## LUKE:
I promise.
Of course I promise.

---

## ANA:
I found something special.

---

## LUKE:
What?

---

## ANA:
But I do not know how to use it.

---

## LUKE:
Use what?

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
I found next to a man.
He was dead.

---

He was American.
Or British.
He was not Japanese.

---

As soon as found it, I knew what it was, and what it could do.
But it was already few days after I had run away from Luke.
I knew I needed him for it to work.

---

## LUKE:
What is that.
What – how did you –

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
Luke was so excited, so happy, I had never ever seen him like that.

---

## LUKE:
Where was the dead man?

---

## ANA:
River.

---

## LUKE:
He was in uniform?

---

## ANA:
Yes.

---

## LUKE:
Like yours or like mine?

---

## ANA:
Yours.

---

## LUKE:
Yes.

---

Yes yes yes, please… Oh Jesus, yes, yes yes yes! Mayday Mayday Mayday Private Whiskey Oscar Oscar Delta Sierra over.
Roger that.
First Private, Galahad Unit in liason
with First Battalion.
Over.

---

## ANA:
What happen? What they say?

---

## LUKE:
Stranded what seems west of Ayeyawady June 14.
Unsure of location.
Roger that.
Over and out.

---

I’m gonna make it.
I’m gonna make it!

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
I knew I needed him.
But I realize now he doesn’t need me.

---

## LUKE:
How am I gonna cross the river.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
He is no longer scared no longer needs me and so he doesn’t see me anymore.

---

## ANA:
Luke.

---

## LUKE:
Fuck it, we’ll just wing it.
Are you coming?

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
I say, “Are we coming back?”

---

## NUMBER FOUR & ANA:
I have to find my sister.

---

## LUKE:
Back? Here? That’s funny.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
He won’t listen.

---

## LUKE:
Got the case got the pack, you got the rifle,

---

## ANA:
You promised you’d help.

---

## LUKE:
What do you think I am doing? We can both go.

---

## ANA:
And then your soldiers will come back to –

---

## LUKE:
I’m a private.
I don’t have any soldiers.
Yet.

---

Come, let’s go.

---

## ANA:
I am not leaving.

---

## LUKE:
Fine then you stay here.

---

Give me my gun.
Hey.
Give me my – What are you doing? Give here.

---

## ANA:
My sister.

---

## LUKE:
No! What are you, okay stop,

---

## ANA:
Promise we come back for –

---

## LUKE:
She’s dead!

---

## ANA:
What?

---

## LUKE:
Look, kid, give me the rifle, okay? We’ll talk without the –

---

## ANA:
But you said,

---

## LUKE:
I lied,

---

## ANA:
Did you, to her too?

---

## LUKE:
Did I what?

---

## ANA:
Did you hurt her?

---

## LUKE:
No!

---

## ANA:
You hurt her and she run away from you, and you are lying because I have gun.

---

## LUKE:
It’s the truth okay I,

---

## ANA:
I trusted you.

---

## LUKE:
It wasn’t me.
Six guys, it was already too late.

---

## ANA:
This whole time, you said you will help me find her, this whole time.

---

## LUKE:
I’m sorry.

---

## ANA:
You said you were American.

---

## LUKE:
I am!

---

## ANA:
But you are the same as them.

---

## LUKE:
What? No! It was, look just give me the gun and let me explain.

---

## ANA:
When?

---

## LUKE:
What does it matter, when? Before, it was before we met, just a couple days before.

---

## ANA:
How?

---

## LUKE:
The guys, they, and I just watched, I promise.

---

## ANA:
You are the same as them.
You are a monster.

---

## LUKE:
You weren’t there, you don’t get to judge.

---

Ahh!! You…shot me.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
I shot him.

---

## LUKE:
Hey! Hey come on, kid, come back.

---

## JESUS:
Why did you run away?

---

## LUKE:
Where are you going?

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
I shot him.

---

## LUKE:
Get back here!

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
If I stayed I would kill him.
Or he would kill me.

---

## LUKE:
Fuck.
Fuck!

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
Then I went back to find him.
But he was gone.

---

He left some things.
He left SPAM.
I was hungry, very hungry suddenly, and so I opened can of SPAM cutting the can till I smell the meat, salty and greasy.

---

Then all of a sudden I throw up.

---

## JESUS:
Yeah, you’re not the only one to have that reaction to SPAM.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
I love SPAM. That is not why.

---

## JESUS:
I know. You were getting sad so I made a joke.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
Oh. Thank you.
I was not getting sad.

---

I was almost happy, when I understand what happened.
Surprised.
That something could decide to grow inside me.

---

## JESUS:
That sounds nice.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
I found a village, pushed into a hut with the rifle.
No worry, I not shoot anybody.

---

## JESUS:
I didn’t say anything.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
I make good friends.
And we found something the little alien liked.

---

## JESUS:
The ugly fruit.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
It smell like feet, you know? The little alien made me eat feet fruit for six whole months.

---

## JESUS:
Why is this the single moment flashing in your mind before you hit the water?

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
It is because of you.

---

## LUKE:
If you had anything to do with any of this, I thank you.
But I don’t think you are real for me anymore.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
I am thinking of them because you are here.

---

## JESUS:
Or maybe I am here ’cause they’re thinking of you.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
Nobody thinks of me.

---

## LUKE:
But maybe if you stay, you could be real for her?

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
Did that really happen?

---

## JESUS:
Why do you think I’m here?

---

## LUKE:
February 12, 1945.

---

There’s that story, about the pilgrim who braved the woods to fight the devil and then upon meeting the devil was surprised to know they bore the same face.

---

Like that story, about the hunters who destroyed the forests to protect their women and children against the tigers and when they were done, discovered they themselves were the tigers.

---

Like that soldier who only wanted to protect the things his heart is made of, but is shown that his heart is made of the same things that he is protecting against and… Did something change? Or was it always the same, was the pilgrim the devil, the hunters the tigers and the soldier, “the same as them,” only he was too stupid to know better before he fucked everything up.

---

## JESUS:
Why does she have your weapon?

---

## LUKE:
Sir, I reported it was lost during combat when –

---

## JESUS:
Why does she have your uniform, weapon and intelligence on the location of our camp, corporal?

---

## LUKE:
Captain,

---

## JESUS:
A hostile soldier.

---

## LUKE:
She’s not –

---

## JESUS:
Cited your number rank and name while trying to barter the rifle, Your rifle.

---

## LUKE:
I can explain, sir.

---

## JESUS:
So explain.

---

## LUKE:
She’s one of the girls we found in the Japanese base.
A runaway, when I found her at first, she was my informant, sir, she gave me the visuals of enemy camp beyond lines.

---

## JESUS:
So you gave your rifle to her as a, what, thank you gift?

---

## LUKE:
No sir, she must’ve retrieved it during combat, but I lost all contact when I was reinstated on base, sir.

---

## JESUS:
With your informant.

---

## LUKE:
Yes.
Sir.
The situation was complicated.

---

## JESUS:
In her condition, I can see how complicated.

---

## LUKE:
Condition, sir?

---

## JESUS:
Corporal Woods.
I value your valor and intelligence in the recent mission, and that honor will not go unrewarded.

---

## LUKE:
Thank you, sir.

---

## JESUS:
But I’m a couple days from taking my men home, and with Jap stragglers at large around the area, I will not tolerate a hostile threat…

---

## LUKE:
She’s not a threat, sir,

---

## JESUS:
…Even the idea of a possible hostile threat in my grounds, do you understand, corporal?

---

## LUKE:
Yes sir.

---

## JESUS:
Do you want to talk?

---

## LUKE:
Sir?

---

## JESUS:
Do you want to talk to the girl? She’s still here.

---

## LUKE:
Oh, um.

---

## JESUS:
I’m going to give you half hour with the girl to clean your mess up, so we can head home, where you can get the recognition you deserve.

---

## LUKE:
Thank you, sir.

---

Permission to ask a question, sir?

---

## JESUS:
Yes.

---

## LUKE:
You said condition, earlier, about her being in a condition.

---

What, what are the details of her condition, sir?

---

## JESUS:
She’s pregnant.

---

## LUKE:
There she stood.
A strange time-travelling dream.
So many thoughts locked together, and I don’t know what to say.

---

You found me.

---

## ANA:
By mistake.

---

## LUKE:
I looked for you.
I was worried.
When we secured the Japanese camps, we found these girls, but you weren’t there, I thought you’d been – Where were you?

---

## ANA:
I made new friends.
In village.

---

## LUKE:
Is it…mine? That why you’re here?

---

## ANA:
There have been more than a thousand men in there.

---

## LUKE:
I’m glad you found us.
We’ll get you home.

---

## ANA:
You will help me?

---

## LUKE:
I’m sure someone can help you get back to your home.

---

## ANA:
I cannot go back to my home.

---

## LUKE:
We’ve taken the area.
The war’s almost over.
We’re all going home.

---

## ANA:
I cannot.
I cannot go back without my sister.

---

## LUKE:
She died.

---

## ANA:
Why you have this?

---

## LUKE:
It was around her neck, when I, found her.

---

## ANA:
But, body –

---

## LUKE:
I buried her.
The village remains, where we first met, behind the far wall on the left, that was more than half a year ago.
There is no way she is still there.

---

## ANA:
I have to go.

---

## LUKE:
Wait, you can’t go there right now.
It’s not a safe zone.
We’ve been shooting at anything that moves.

---

She left.

---

## JESUS:
Water.
We hit water.
High five!

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
What is that?

---

## JESUS:
It’s a movement of joy.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
Why are you so much joy?

---

## JESUS:
We hit water.
Not rock, not cement, cuddly squishy water!

---

## LUKE:
You have to put that out.
We have an entire platoon scanning this area –

---

## ANA:
What are you doing!

---

## LUKE:
What am I – you have a fucking fire going in the middle of battlegrounds.
Jesus, what are you burning?

---

## ANA:
I found her.
My baby sister.

---

## LUKE:
We have to put her out.

---

## ANA:
She is my baby sister.

---

## LUKE:
I know.

---

## ANA:
She is dead.

---

I don’t have to look for her now.
I don’t know what I must do now.

---

I feel so tired.

---

## LUKE:
You’re…there’s a puddle…are you bleeding?

---

## ANA:
No, I…I feel funny.

---

## LUKE:
Funny how? What’s going on?

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
Who are all these people?

---

## JESUS:
Five to eight hundred civilians, seventy-seven policemen,

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
Why are they floating?

---

## JESUS:
Because they are dead.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
And me?

---

## JESUS:
You are not.
Now we can swim up! Come on jiggy dance jiggy dance!

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
I don’t want to.

---

## JESUS:
What? Why?

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
Tired.

---

## LUKE:
Oh shit! Woods to base.
Woods to base.
Come here, come!

---

## ANA:
Tired.

---

## LUKE:
We have to get out of here.

---

## ANA:
Something wrong.

---

## LUKE:
Woods to base, friendlies west of Ayeyawady,

---

## ANA:
Something very wrong.

---

## LUKE:
Hold fire, hold fire! Woods to base, Whiskey Oscar Oscar Delta Sierra, Hold on okay,

---

## JESUS:
Hold your breath,

---

## LUKE:
We’re gonna be fine.

---

## JESUS:
Hey come on you are so close to the surface, please kick,

---

## ANA:
Baby want to see us early.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
Do you think she is alive?

---

## JESUS:
What?

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
My baby? I wonder if she is alive.
I wonder if she will remember being in my body.
I wonder if she look like me.

---

## JESUS:
Swim up maybe one day we’ll find out.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
I am tired of maybes.

---

## JESUS:
You’re going to drown.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
Maybe.

---

## JESUS:
Don’t you want to live?

---

## LUKE:
Okay, hold on, okay, I’ve got you, right, okay?

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
Thirty to forty a day.
Multiplied by seven is two hundred a week.

---

If you are bleeding, if you are sleeping. No one cares.

---

Thirty to forty a day.

---

## LUKE:
Look at me, look at me, focus,

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
At first you are quiet because opium, but then you are quiet because you’re numb.

---

And then you come home and you quiet because, because,

---

Because what can I say?
Mother and Father.
I had thirty to forty a day.

---

I had a baby.
I threw away my baby.
I threw away your baby.

---

That is not good for them.
I want to be good for them.

---

I just want to be their daughter again.

---

## LUKE:
Can you hear me? Cease fire, we are friendlies – Just.
Breathe.
Come on.
We can do this.

---

## ANA:
I can’t,

---

## LUKE:
Yes Yes you can.
Just… like that huh? Like… do that.

---

## ANA:
UMMA!

---

## LUKE:
Copy, Corporal Woods, First Battalion, under severe friendly fire.
In out In out.
Breathe woman!

---

## ANA:
Hurts so much,

---

## LUKE:
I’m going in.

---

## ANA:
UMMA!

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
But the quiet, it hurts.
Not just me, everybody.

---

One day, my father’s soles come off his shoe.
He asks me to fix it, he says I worked in shoe factory for two years, so he smile and ask me to fix his shoe and all I can think is I want to kill you.

---

I want to, to my father.
I love my father.
I know I do.

---

But my arm is thinking kill, my arm is so angry, the things I keep for their happy, for my happy, they build up layer by layer into sharp steel, this sharp steel it grinds into my insides every time I breathe, it is so loud, so angry, it just wants to stab stab stab.

---

## JESUS:
It’s okay.

---

## ANA:
Make it stop! Make it stop!

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
It’s not okay I want it to stop.

---

## LUKE:
I know I know I know,

---

## ANA & NUMBER FOUR:
Make it stop.

---

## LUKE:
It’ll stop soon I promise.

---

## JESUS:
I could tell you Luke will have to fight three more wars before he knows how to find you.

---

## LUKE:
How’re you doing? Are you breathing? Talk to me.

---

## JESUS:
Tell you how Ana is crying on the other side of the world right now,

---

## ANA:
Shoot it!

---

## JESUS:
Dreaming about her mother.

---

## LUKE:
What?

---

## ANA:
Shoot it dead!

---

## LUKE:
Okay we can do that later, right now I’m gonna need you to push,

---

## JESUS:
That you will hold your love despite your rage,

---

## ANA:
Shut up I hate you!

---

## JESUS:
That forty-two years from now you will find that this rage was shared among 200,000 women of this land,

---

## LUKE:
I know I know I’m sorry just a bit more okay?

---

## ANA:
No.

---

## LUKE:
Almost done almost,

---

## JESUS:
I could tell you all there is to know of the world but none of these things will make it stop.
Things don’t stop, they grow, or shrink, recover or wither.

---

## LUKE:
Push.

---

## ANA:
Get it out! Get it out! Get it out!

---

## JESUS:
Once you’ve existed, you don’t ever stop.
Breathe in water, and your absence will do things to the world.
Kick your legs, and your life will do things to the world.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
Like my baby.

---

## JESUS:
Yeah.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
My daughter.
She kick a lot.

---

## JESUS:
She does.

---

## ANA:
Hurts.
So bad.

---

## LUKE:
Oh my god.
Oh my god.
I see the head,

---

## ANA:

## LUKE:

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
She hurt me so much.

---

## LUKE:
Okay okay I’m gonna okay slit the,

---

## ANA:
Noooo!

---

## LUKE:
A little so – the thing can have room.

---

## ANA:
MMMMMAAAA!

---

## JESUS:
I’m sure she would say the same of you.

---

## LUKE:
Shit.
It worked.

---

## JESUS:
It’s not exactly a party to slide through a hole the size of a golf ball, you know.

---

## LUKE:
It worked.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
She did seem very angry about it.

---

## LUKE:
It worked.
It’s coming it’s coming!

---

## JESUS:
So? What do you think?

---

## LUKE:
Push!

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
Okay.

---

## ANA:
UUUUMMMMAAAAAA!

---

## KOREAN:
[There’s another one.] 
[Lady! Hey lady, are you okay?]

---

## LUKE:
Hey kid.
She’s…

---

## ANA:
It’s a she?

---

## KOREAN:
[Look look, she’s not dead.]
[Hello, are you okay?]

---

## LUKE:
Yeh, she’s, I think – She is –

---

## KOREAN:
[What’s your name? Hello?]

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
My name is…

---

ANOTHER KOREAN.
[Do you remember your name?]

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
My name is 

---

Oh Jin-ah.

---

## LUKE:
I think she’s mine.

---

## LUKE:
March 28.
Rain.
Pouring like it did mid-July.
Everything smells a little less awake.

---

Captain?

---

## JESUS:
You can take them home.

---

## LUKE:
Sir?

---

## JESUS:
Of course we’d need to have proof of familial relations.

---

## LUKE:
She has no family in the US, sir, she’s from Chosun. Korea.

---

## JESUS:
Sign this, you’re her family.

---

## LUKE:
Pardon me, sir, I don’t understand.

---

## JESUS:
Marry the girl, she’s yours to ship back home.
If you want.

---

## LUKE:
How –

---

## JESUS:
I take care of my boys, corporal.
The girls will be transported to the border this afternoon.
She’ll want to say her goodbyes, I imagine.
Get the signed papers to Lieutenant Corvax.
Dismissed.

---

## LUKE:
She was asleep when I found her.
Her face, so peaceful, childlike.
Miracles happen.
And then people mess up.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
We go home together.

---

## LUKE:
War’s just ended.
Situation’s complicated.

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
You said we go home together.

---

## ANA:
“She looks up at me, leaning, pleading, and I feel something lurch, from the pit of my stomach.
Nightmares fly up into my mouth,”

---

## LUKE:
It’s complicated.

---

## ANA:
“Contaminates the tongue,”

---

## NUMBER FOUR:
What about baby?

---

## ANA:
“I lied.”
