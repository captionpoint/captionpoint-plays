What is the matter, Uncle Ben!?

class: cyan
## BEN:
So many things. What language is that?

---

## SARAH:
French. 

---
class: cyan
## BEN:
A miserable failure. 

---

## SARAH:
Uncle?!

---
class: cyan
## BEN:
Not your French... Although it could use some improvement.

---
class: cyan
## BEN:
This... this... experiment! It simply did not work!  Where is my notebook?.

## BEN:
(to the tune of Frere Jacques)
Where's my notebook, where's my notebook?

class: cyan
## BEN:
Sarah! What on earth are you doing?! 

---

## SARAH:
The experiment is a miserable failure. Don’t you want it gone from sight? 

---
class: cyan
## BEN:
Oh, youth. In such a hurry to get things right. 

---

## SARAH:
I-- I don’t understand. Isn’t it a mistake?

---
class: cyan
## BEN:
Certainly, a mistake. 

---

## SARAH:
A really big mistake?

---
class: cyan
## BEN:
Yes. But it is also a set of clues. A chance to gain some knowledge. 

---

## SARAH:
Mistakes are annoying.

---
class: cyan
## BEN:
Mistakes are essential! How am I going to learn anything, if I am not learning anything? 

---

## SARAH:
That does make a bit of sense. 

---
class: cyan
## BEN:
When I have a problem,

---

[DING]

---
class: cyan
## BEN
I observe and ask a question; then I make a hypothesis. 

---

## SARAH:
A what? 

---
class: cyan
## BEN:
A sort of educated guess-- a prediction, based on the clues-- as to what is going on. 

---
class: cyan
## BEN:
Then comes the fun part: the experiment. Sometimes it goes as expected. 

---

## SARAH:
And sometimes it does not. 

---
class: cyan
## BEN:
I think we’ve established that, thank you. Even still, we have some results, or data, 

---
class: cyan
## BEN:
which can be analyzed and recorded to arrive at... a conclusion. 

---

## SARAH:
A conclusion? Like an end? 

---
class: cyan
## BEN:
An end-- and also a beginning. 

---

## SARAH:
The end is the beginning? That’s confusing. 

---
class: cyan
## BEN:
Think of experimenting not as a line. But as a circle. 

---

## SARAH:
The beginning leads to the end... and then back to the beginning! I get it! 

---

But it’s hard to keep it going.

---
class: cyan
## BEN:
You’ll have to keep practicing.

Oh, Uncle Ben! Take me to France!

Ah ha! Your mother calls.

## MOTHER:
Time for your French lessons!

Oh la la! Will you see the latest fashions?

## BEN:
No, no. Nothing like that.

## BEN:
Off you go!

## SARAH:
What better way to learn French than in France?

## BEN:
This is not the moment to accompany me. Paris is in a bit of a frenzy. 

---

## SARAH:
A frenzy? My favorite! Tell me more!

---
class: cyan
## BEN:
It’s all because of a...

---

[MYSTERIOUS HUM]

---
class: cyan
## BEN:
Doctor Mesmer. 

---

## SARAH:
Doctor Mesmer? 

---
class: cyan
## BEN:
A supposed healer of some sort. The King of France has requested my help... 

---
class: cyan
## BEN:
(in a French accent)
“Ben Franklin will solve it... Ben Franklin knows everything... Why not send for Ben?” 

---
class: cyan
## BEN:
Because... 

---
class: cyan
## BEN:
Ben. Is. Exhausted. 

---
class: cyan
## BEN:
And I’ve got gout! But! The King needs my help. 

---
class: cyan
## BEN:
And I need his. 

---

## SARAH:
SO. MANY. QUESTIONS. First: Why do you need the King’s help? 

---

Second: What is gout? 

---

Third-- and, I just thought of this one-- 

---

WILL YOU TAKE ME TO FRANCE?!?!

---
class: cyan
## BEN:
First: I need to ask the King to support the American revolution-- in short, we must have more money. 

---
class: cyan
## BEN:
Second: Gout is a complex disease arising from a build-up of uric acid in the body. 

---
class: cyan
## BEN:
It takes hold of the big toe and awakens the sufferer from slumber with the feeling that his toe... 

---
class: cyan
## BEN:
...is on fire! 

---

## SARAH:
And... the third question... about taking me to France? 

---
class: cyan
## BEN:
That’s a hard no. 

---

## SARAH:
UGH!! 

---

## SARAH:
Pleeeeeeease! Please please please-

---
class: cyan
## BEN:
Sarah, really. You are too young. And too... 

---

## SARAH:
Too... not a boy? 

---
class: cyan
## BEN:
Something like that. 

---

## SARAH:
But that’s so unfair. 

---
class: cyan
## BEN:
Yes. It is. 

---

## MOTHER:
Sarah. This. Instant.

---
class: cyan
## BEN:
Run along! Your mother calls. And my dear sister is not to be trifled with.

---
class: cyan
## BEN:
She terrifies me.

---

## SARAH:
I’m only learning a few French words for society. 

---

The tutor is also teaching me how to curtsy; when to smile and laugh. And when to keep silent. 

---

It’s all just for show. My brothers are allowed to attend real school. 

---
class: cyan
## BEN:
Yes, well. France will wait for you. For now, stay curious, ask questions, make mistakes. 

---

And, above all, do not waste time. For time is what life is made of.

Do not waste time? Do not waste time, you say? Well, then, I shall not. Not a single second.

What’s all the fuss?! Couldn’t this have waited until morning?

This Doctor Mesmer continues to be a nuisance.

He is stealing our patients.

## DOCTOR 1:
And our patients’ money. 

---

## DOCTOR 2:
And, therefore, our money.

class: cyan
## KING: 
Hmm. The patients are going to Mesmer for a cure...

## DOCTOR 1:
Even though we have brilliant treatments... 

---

## DOCTOR 2:
Treatments like leeches! Did you bring the leeches?

class: cyan
## KING: 
What do they do exactly... the leeches?

## DOCTOR 1:
They suck out the bad blood...

Ick. That doesn’t sound so fun. And what does Mesmer do?

## DOCTOR 2:
He uses a magic wand.

A magic wand? That’s it?

## DOCTORS:
Oui.

Patients pay Mesmer and not the doctors... The doctors have less money, and so, I have less money.

Docteur Tardé to see King Louis the XVI!

Finally!

## DOCTOR 3:
Am I late?

Yes, but never mind. Do you have the leeches?

## DOCTOR 3:
Oops! I knew I was forgetting something!

## DOCTOR 2:
That guy! Always a day late and a leech short!

## DOCTOR 1:
He is such a poo-poo head.

The patients say they are cured.

## DOCTOR 2:
But they cannot actually be cured!

## DOCTOR 1:
They say they feel better.

## DOCTOR 2:
But they cannot possibly feel better!

A note!?

Then I fixed the trunk, so it wouldn’t lock. And when I got on board, I made friends with the cook.

He made me the most wonderful suppers...

And nobody stopped you?

## SARAH:
Not dressed like a boy, they didn’t!

I told anyone who asked that I was your grandson! People even wanted my autograph!

And what is it you plan to do now?

My plan is to help you, Uncle Ben! With your experiments, your inventions,

I am leaving for the palace shortly. I cannot bring you with me...

Can I? No, no, no... that will not work.

The negotiations with the king can be very tense.

Negotiations? What’s that?

Oh, I am very good at that.

## BEN:
You are rather convincing as a boy.

Perhaps I can be your assistant!

class: cyan
## BEN:
No no no, you couldn’t possibly be my assistant.

You could be my valet.

But I gave you mountains of money. Just last year! For the same revolution!

It is the same revolution, yes?

Yes. Turns out it’s very expensive to start a country.

Oh, well, yes... but really we are asking for continued support of the revolution.

Revolution?! In France?! Impossible!

Non, non, non... the AMERICAN revolution!

Ha! The look on your face... Revolution...Non, non, it could never happen here!

Ah. Of course. American Revolution. You can do it!

[MYSTERIOUS HARPSICHORD]

I had a terrible headache... I have no idea what was causing it. 

---

Shhh. There was a buzz all around Paris... 

---

Doctor Mesmer, Doctor Mesmer, Doctor Mesmer. Lady Champignon told Monsieur Mimolette... 

---

## FRENCHPERSON:
Mon dieu!

## MARIE:
...who spoke to Madame Frederic...

## FRENCHPERSON:
Zut alors!

---

## MARIE:
...who said something to Monsieur Arc-en-Ciel.

---

## FRENCHPERSON:
Sacre bleu!

---

## MARIE:
Who divulged the details to moi! 

---

I simply could not believe what I was hearing. So I went to see Dr. Mesmer for myself. 

---

And I was... mesmerized!!!

So how can you be certain Mesmer’s power is any different?

How are we going to learn anything if we are not learning anything?

What do you mean the wand may have some power?

I thought you said, and I quote: “It all does sound rather outrageous.”

Tying a key to a kite and flying it in a lightning storm also sounds pretty outrageous.

## KING:
Now that’s bananas!

First we establish the problem...

The problem is the doctors pounding on my door!

No no no, that is a side-effect. Then make some observations!

Then we arrive at a question...

Will the doctors every stop being so angry?

No, the question is: Can Mesmer actually cure patients with the wave of a wand?

## KING:
Hypothesis?

[MYSTERIOUS MUSIC]

---

## MESMER:
What is that music? Wait-- have I mesmerized myself? 

---
class: cyan
## CHARLES:
Dr. Mesmer! 

---

## MESMER:
Charles!

---
class: cyan
## CHARLES:
I followed you all the way to Switzerland! 

---
class: cyan
## CHARLES:
Wow, am I hungry! Fondue?

---

## MESMER:
Hmmm...looks like a wand... Acts like a wand... 

---
class: cyan
## CHARLES:
It is a wand!

---

## MESMER:
There are some people whom Ben Frahnklin and his science will never convince! 

---

Let’s go find them. Come, Charles, patients await! Don't forget my luggage!

## SARAH AND BEN:
(singing in better French)
Frère Jacques, Frère Jacques

---
class: cyan
## SARAH AND BEN:
Dormez-vous? Dormez-vous?

---
class: cyan
## SARAH AND BEN:
Sonnez les matines, Sonnez les matines

---
class: cyan
## SARAH AND BEN:
Ding dang dong! Ding dang dong!

---
class: cyan
## BEN:
Ahhhh! So good to be home. 

---

## SARAH:
Not really. France was so exciting! I got to conduct experiments. 

---
class: cyan
## BEN:
Your contributions were essential.

---

## SARAH:
I got to say things, and people listened. Now I have to go back to... 

---

## MOTHER:
Sarah! 

---

[FIREWORKS]

---
class: cyan
## BEN:
But look! The war is coming to an end, and it’s the beginning of a new country... a new experiment... 

---

## SARAH:
Uncle Ben, do you hear me? I cannot go back to just doing what I’m told, sitting properly, 

---

holding my tea cup just so, not thinking for myself or even being myself! 

---

## MOTHER:
Time for your lessons! 

---
class: cyan
## BEN:
Dear sister-- Sarah is... 

---
class: cyan
## BEN:
Busy. Helping me. With an experiment. 

---

## MOTHER:
Ok. 

---
class: cyan
## BEN:
Ok? 

---

## MOTHER:
Just don’t let her hop the next boat to France! 

---
class: cyan
## BEN:
It’s a deal! 

---

## MOTHER:
AND NO LIGHTNING!! 

---

## SARAH:
Another experiment, Uncle Ben?

---
class: cyan
## BEN:
Perhaps the greatest experiment of all!

---
class: cyan
## BEN:
We are building a new country. The United States of America. 

---
class: cyan
## BEN:
One without a king or a queen. One built and run by the people-- 

---

## SARAH:
A country not run by a king or a queen -- is it possible?

---
class: cyan
## BEN:
I do not know. 

---

## SARAH:
But you’ve written words and words and more words about this new country. How can you not know? 

---
class: cyan
## BEN:
If we’ve learned anything from Dr. Mesmer, my dear, it’s that the power was not in his wand, but in the imaginations of the people. 

---
class: cyan
## BEN:
A wand is just a wand! And a pen is just a pen. The power is not in the pen. It's...

---

## SARAH:
It’s in the people. 

---
class: cyan
## BEN:
Yes. In their hearts and minds. 

---

## SARAH:
The Constitution...

---
class: cyan
## BEN:
Yes, go ahead. Read the first line. 

---

## SARAH:
We the people.

---

I’m a person, Uncle Ben. Am I in here? What about my mother? 

---
class: cyan
## BEN:
Oh, my dear sister... 

---

## SARAH:
Or… People who don’t look like... um...well… like you. 

---
class: cyan
## BEN:
I-- I don’t have an answer for that. 

---

## SARAH:
We all should be part of this experiment, Uncle Ben. 

---

Every single one of us. The more people we include in the experiment, the better the experiment will be! 

---

You said so yourself. 

---

[FIREWORKS] 

---
class: cyan
## BEN:
What is YOUR prediction? 

---

## SARAH:
You want to know my hypothesis? About this whole United States of America experiment?

---
class: cyan
## BEN:
Your ideas are essential. 

---

[FLUTES PLAYING YANKEE DOODLE]

---

## SARAH:
I’m still observing... questioning. 

---

And I think this is just the beginning.
