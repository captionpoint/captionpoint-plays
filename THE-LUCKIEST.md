## PETER: 
So everybody is confirmed for tomorrow 
---
all 40 of them.  
---
Forty seems like a lot. 
---
Do you really like all of these people?    
---
I don’t think I even like ten 
people.  
---
Maybe fifteen.  
---
But forty.    
---
Allison finally got back to 
me.  
---
I had to nag her which was 
---
annoying but she’s coming. 
---
Why is she always so.  
---
She’s always so.  
---
Weird.  
---
About committing to things right? 
---
What’s that about.    
---
Isn’t she too old to be so.  
---
To be such a fucking commitmentphobe 
---
about everything 
---
about fucking brunch plans.  
---
Like just say yes.  
---
Don’t be an asshole and make 
---
us beg to hang out with you.    
---
Like maybe if she started 
---
responding to emails 
---
she could find love and happiness.  
---
She’s turning into one of those 
---
crabby old ladies.   
---
She is you know she is 
---
she needs to nip that shit 
---
in the bud right now.   
---
But she’s coming!  
---
Yay!    
---
Everybody is coming.    
---
I said 10am.  
---
Is that too early?    
---
I figure we can just hang out today right?  
---
You and me.  
---
Relax.  
---
Just us.  
---
And then tomorrow the masses can all descend.    
---
OK good good. 
---
This house is great, right? 
---
I was a little…  
---
Unsure?  
---
About a random Air BnB in Vermont?  
---
AirBnB creeps me out a bit.  
---
But the pictures were pretty 
spot on.    
---
Did you see there’s a pool out back?    
---
Maybe we’ll sit by the pool. 
---
Later.    
---
If you feel up to it. 
---
No rules.  
---
For today no rules.  
---
Tomorrow there are rules. 
---
For everybody else. 
---
But no rules for us.  
---
AirBnB was the right call, yes?
---
Your mom's cousin's place could have been
---
weird.
---
Ok, good.
---
Glad we are in agreement.
---
So, I have like uh
---
I have like
---
I went to Trader Joe’s 
---
and I got the.  
---
That cheese with the whatsitcalled the.    
---
Cheddar with the truffles.  
---
That was the right one, right?  
---
And I got the.  
---
You wanted the.    
---
Mediterranean hummus, right?    
---
OK good.  
---
There were many hummus-es. 
---
Is that the plural of hummus?   
---
Or is it? 
---
Hummus-i?  Is that it?  
---
There were so many hummus-i?  
---
template: song
You say hummus-es.  
---
template: song
I say hummus-i.  
---
Sorry I’m making the joke 
---
go on way too long aren’t I.  
---
It wasn’t that funny of  a joke.    
---
Oh really?  
---
You don’t like my joke Lissette?  
---
Fuck you.    
---
But good I got the right hummus.    
---
And, I got like   
---
So many chips.  
---
I’m sorry.  
---
I was kind of overwhelmed 
---
by the snack aisle.  
---
Trader Joe’s has so many snacks, right?    
---
Tortilla chips.  
---
Ghost Pepper chips.
---
Truffle chips.  
---
There were ten kinds of pop corn.
---
TEN!  
---
So I just started them all in the cart. 
---
I was out of control.  
---
I’m sorry.  
---
They just all sounded good 
---
and I couldn’t decide and I.      
---
There are never too many chips though right?  
---
People like chips?    
---
OK OK OK OK so we have chips.  
---
We will never want. 
---
For chips.    
---
I ordered the cake 
---
from that place you love 
---
that makes the gluten free cakes 
---
that don’t taste like shit. 
---
Chocolate with chocolate ganache.    
---
They said jam or no jam.  
---
And I said no jam.    
---
I just kept hearing your voice 
---
in my head saying.  
---
Why would anybody fuck up 
---
a ganache with jam.    
---
Is that something you have 
---
actually said to me?  
---
Or did you send me a psychic message.   
---
OK I’m not crazy you have said this.    
---
Do you hate me that I don’t 
---
remember us having that conversation?   
---
So long as there is no jam 
---
fucking up your ganache.    
---
OK there won’t be.  
---
So…  We’re good.    
---
Oh! So I was thinking.  
---
Keep an open mind about this 
---
or try to keep an open mind.    
---
Stop judging before you hear 
it.    
---
OK so I was thinking I know 
---
we didn’t go over this 
---
I know I’m going a little rogue 
---
with this idea but.  
---
How do you feel about a.  
---
A signature cocktail!   
---
template: noise
## LISSETTE:
grunting uh uh
---
Oh come on!    
---
What’s wrong with a signature cocktail???  
---
Oh so you are the only one alive 
---
 who is allowed to make a signature 
cocktail?  
---
Is that it?    
---
I promise it won’t be annoying.  
---
I would never make anything 
---
annoying for you for this I just. 
---
Something with...Campari?    
---
Oh…  See that.  
---
See what happens when you hear 
---
someone out before making a decision.  
---
When you remain open to possibility.  
---
See.
---
Maybe don’t try to control everything.  
---
Maybe trust people to not be idiots
---
and maybe come up with ideas that 
---
you maybe don’t hate maybe.    
---
Maybe 
---
something with gin.  
---
and bitters
---
fresh squeezed blood orange juice
---
a little rosemary.
---
I knew it. 
---
I knew you would love this.  
---
I know you better than 
---
you know yourself, Lissette. 
---
Never forget that.   
---
Fine. I know you a little bit better.
---
Equally, is that better?
---
I know you Equally.  
---
Oh, uh   
---
I was thinking about naming it
---
the Fuck You.  
---
Do you like that?
---
Should it be more specific?  
---
Like fuck you to something specific.  
---
Or is it just a general fuck you.     
---
Just a general fuck you. 
---
Like fuck you to everything.    
---
You love it?   
---
OK good.  
---
The fuck you.  M’Lady.  
---
You now have a signature cocktail.  
---
And I’ll make prissy Allison 
---
ask for it by name.  
---
I won’t give it to her till she says.  
---
Yeah I’d like another Fuck You please.  
---
Oh.
---
So your mom insisted on making the lasagna.  
---
## LISSETTE:
No, but  I  Said
---
## PETER:
No talking.
---
Save your voice for tomorrow.
---
Shut It.  
---
She wanted to make the lasagna
---
let her make lasagna.
---
She needed a job. 
---
This is her job.    
---
I am making.  
---
Thanksgiving.  
---
Roasted turkey.
---
Stuffing.  
---
Mashed potatoes. 
---
Deviled eggs.    
---
So let your mom make the lasagna.  
---
At seven pm we will play.  
---
It’s The End of The World As We 
Know It.    
---
## LISSETTE:
[laughs]
---
## PETER:
You like that? 
---
Yeah, I thought that was a little funny?
---
But also sad. 
---
It’s a little.  Sad.    
---
template: song
It’s the end of the world as we 
know it. 
---
template: song
And I feel fine.  
---
And I…  
---
I made a.  
---
list of the rules 
---
so that people don't forget.  
---
Is that weird? 
---
I thought it would be good 
---
to remind them that they.  
---
OK.    
---
One, No crying in front of Lissette.  
---
Pause sidenote.  
---
I... I thought we could make 
---
like a designated 
---
“Crying Room” where people can go?  
---
Is that weird? 
---
It may be a little weird...
---
We’ll try it maybe?
---
OK good.  
---
Two, No reading letters to Lissette.  
---
Three, Tell lots of jokes.  
---
Four, Remember nice memories to share.
---
Five, Lissette may cry.  
---
Don’t get weird if Lissette cries.  
---
Peter may cry.
---
Peter may cry but.  
---
He promises to not do it in front of Lissette.   
---
I promise I won’t cry.  
---
In front of you.  
---
I also may have a letter. 
---
## LISSETTE:
[grunting, uh uh]
---
## PETER:
Really?  
---
You don’t want to hear my letter?  
---
Oh yeah?  
---
Well I may force you to sit 
---
and listen to me read your 
letter.  
---
I may hold you down and aggressively 
---
read you my fucking letter.  
---
Yes yes yes.  
---
Sorry sorry sorry.    
---
---
Hey so I love you?  
---
But... 
---
This position is.  
---
It’s super awkward.  
---
Sorry I just that was.  
---
Sorry.  
---
Thank you?  For what?  
---
I mean I.  
---
All I did was go to Trader Joe’s.  
---
But sure OK.  
---
You’re welcome.    
---
Oh my God. Stop.
---
What are you doing?
---
Are you making a heart with your hands? 
---
Yeah.  
---
Yeah me too. 
---
template: music
---
## PETER: 
Even if you’re in a coma 
---
an indefinite coma 
---
template: overlap
## PETER:
for an indefinite time. 

## LISSETTE: 
Why am I on Falcon Crest 
---
and why is it 1986? 
---
## PETER: 
This was your theoretical!
---
I’m just. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
OK fine fine fine.  
---
I would still want to live even then. 
---
## PETER: 
That’s a big fat lie. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
It’s not! 
---
## PETER: 
Really??? 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Yes yes really. 
---
## PETER: 
Even if you can’t engage 
---
with anyone or anything 
---
and you’re eating through tubes 
---
and you can’t have sex or even. 
---
Like you can’t ever leave the bed 
---
or the hospital you are in 
---
a vegetative state and you.   
---
## LISSETTE: 
Yes even then! 
---
## PETER: 
Liar.   
---
## LISSETTE: 
Fuck you!  
---
I’m not lying I’m being very sincere.  
---
Also if I am indeed on Falcon 
Crest 
---
I will probably magically come 
---
template: overlap
## LISSETTE:
to life in a few seasons and so.   

## PETER: 
Nobody would choose that.  
---
We would all choose pulling the plug.  
---
If you’re brain dead and you’re. 
---
template: overlap
## LISSETTE: 
Hold up you didn’t say brain dead you said. 

## PETER: 
Yes I did. 
---
template: overlap
## LISSETTE: 
You said coma. 

## PETER: 
It’s the exact same thing. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Nope two different things.  
---
template: overlap
## LISSETTE:
Two completely different things. 

## PETER: 
Medically they are the same things! 
---
## LISSETTE: 
We have no idea what happens 
---
when people are in comas.
---
People in comas could have very 
---
template: overlap
## LISSETTE:
rich very full inner lives they could. 

## PETER: 
Yeah I don’t think that’s what we’re. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
For all we know it’s better than life.  
---
template: overlap
## LISSETTE:
It could be wonderful! 

## PETER: 
Being in a coma. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
It could be!  
---
We actually have no idea!   
---
## PETER: 
You would force all of your 
---
loved ones to stay in a constant state 
---
of terror and fear and sadness.  
---
template: overlap
## PETER:
Watching and waiting and worrying that you’re. 

## LISSETTE: 
So wait.  
---
Are you saying that life. 
---
My actual life.  
---
template: overlap
## LISSETTE:
Or whatever my theoretical life where I am. 

## PETER: 
On Falcon Crest. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Yes right 
---
so my life.  
---
My life on season three of Falcon Crest 
---
where I am hooked up to machines. 
---
Whether or not I choose to do that.  
---
That decision.  
---
Should be about other people’s feelings? 
---
Is that it? 
---
## PETER: 
I didn’t say that. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Are you also anti choice? 
---
## PETER:
Wait what???? 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I mean if you think. 
---
## PETER: 
What is happening?  
---
template: overlap
## PETER:
How did we get here? 

## LISSETTE: 
If you think that other people 
---
should make decisions about my life 
---
and my body why not go all the way 
---
why not. 
---
## PETER: 
What I am arguing for is 
---
the opposite of anti choice!!!
---
You! 
---
You are actually onthe same side 
---
as the anti choice people! 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I am not! 
---
## PETER: 
You absolutely are! 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Really what this is.  
---
Is that we’re just scared of the unknown 
---
and so we would.  
---
You would.  
---
Because I already said that I wouldn’t.  
---
But you would choose death over 
---
the unknown and that’s. 
---
## PETER: 
That’s not actually what I said I was just. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I mean that’s actually exactly what you. 
---
## PETER: 
THIS IS TOO INTENSE A CONVERSATION 
---
TO HAVE WITH A STRANGER! 
---
---
## PETER: 
I'm Sorry I was just. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I’m not a stranger.  
---
We’ve been talking for hours and hours.   
---
## PETER: 
One hour.  
---
We have been talking for exactly one hour. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Well it feels like many hours. 
---
## PETER: 
Is that a criticism?  
---
Are you not enjoying the conversation? 
---
## LISSETTE: 
No, I am very much enjoying the conversation!  
---
I am simply saying it feels like. 
---
## PETER: 
Like you’ve been stuck with me 
---
for multiple hours talking about comas?
---
How did we even get on this topic? 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I actually can’t remember.   
---
## PETER: 
Wasn't it... Wait. 
---
Wasn’t there somebody wasn’t somebody 
---
wasn’t it that woman 
---
the one who kept crying 
---
wasn’t she talking about 
---
oh wait didn’t she 
---
just fuck didn’t she put her 
---
cat to sleep was that it.   
---
## LISSETTE: 
Oh... Yeah I think that was it. 
---
## PETER: 
Oh that’s so sad. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
It’s really sad. 
---
## PETER: 
I mean not a big cat person but still. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Yeah no me neither. 
---
## PETER: 
They’re so aloof. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Totally.  
---
I don’t want my pet to be aloof. 
---
## PETER: 
But still it’s still. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
It’s so sad.   
---
---
## PETER: 
Well...
---
That killed the conversation didn’t it? 
---
## LISSETTE: 
No pun intended… 
---
## PETER: 
Oh pun definitely intended. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Oh no!  
---
How do we get it back? 
---
## PETER: 
I think we stop talking about death. 
---
## LISETTE:
But we were talking about death 
---
before and it was going so well! 
---
## PETER: 
Right, but that was theoretical 
---
make believe death.   
---
## LISSETTE: 
Actually it was a coma.  
---
I was in a coma on a soap opera in the 80’s. 
---
## PETER: 
Right it wasn’t actual death.   
---
## LISSETTE: 
Coma.   
---
## PETER: 
Sure.  Coma.  
---
Brain... Death.   
---
## PETER: 
Maybe we should talk about the 
things 
---
you know the things you talk about at parties like...    
---
How do you know Allison? 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I know Allison because Allison 
---
was my roommate in college. 
---
## PETER: 
Ah...  Interesting. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
How do you know Allison?
---
## PETER: 
I actually don’t know Allison.  
---
I crashed the party I don’t know anybody here.   
---
## LISSETTE: 
Oh my God really? 
---
## PETER: 
No I came with Donovan. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Oh!  Donovan...
---
## PETER: 
Do you dislike Donovan? 
---
## LISETTE:
No!   
---
Not at all!   
---
But... You were far more 
interesting 
---
when you were the guy who crashed the party.  
---
Now you’re just like whatever you’re.  
---
Donovan’s plus one.    
---
Yay Donovan!  
---
Our friend! 
---
## PETER:
Yay! 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Wait are you actually on a date with Donovan? 
---
## PETER: 
Oh I mean.  
---
## LISSETTE: 
Oh shit are you the guy he keeps talking about??? 
---
## PETER: 
Who is the guy he keeps talking about? 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Are you the Vet? 
---
## PETER: 
I am not...The Vet. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Oh fuck sorry. 
---
## PETER: 
I am the real estate agent. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Oh... Right.    
---
Donavan is a douche.  
---
You can do way better than.  
---
Donovan.  
---
Like we call him sometimes 
---
we call him Douchebag Donavan.  
---
To his face.  Ask him.  
---
And we are his friends.  
---
So. Trust me.   
---
You can do way better than Donovan.  
---
Like even his name, right?  
---
You name someone Donovan you are 
---
setting them up to be an asshole. 
---
## PETER: 
It’s not exclusive or anything. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Sure sure. 
---
## PETER: 
It’s super casual it’s.   
---
I mean it’s.  
---
I don’t know what it is but it’s.   
---
## PETER: 
Oh hey! 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Huh. 
---
## PETER: 
What about what about what about.  
---
Alzheimer’s! 
---
## LISSETTE: 
What about Alzheimer’s. 
---
## PETER: 
Lets say you had Alzheimer’s.  
---
You’re physically fine.  
---
Your mind is gone but you can still 
---
see great art.  
---
Eat delicious food.  
---
Have moments of joy.  
---
Real true joy.  
---
But you no longer remember 
---
people you used to love.  
---
You have no idea who they are.  
---
What about then?
---
Would you then?
---
## LISSETTE: 
Would I what then? 
---
## PETER: 
Would you want to live 
---
or would you want to die?
---
## LISSETTE: 
Oh I um.  
---
I don’t know actually I...  
---
I mean I. 
---
My grandmother actually has 
---
Alzheimer’s and so. 
---
## PETER: 
Oh fuck sorry! 
---
## LISSETTE: 
No it’s OK it’s really OK 
---
you didn’t know I just.  
---
It’s sad sometimes to think 
about it 
---
to think about her and I. 
---
## PETER: 
I was just trying to bring us back 
---
to assisted suicide 
---
and I took a weird morbid turn.   
---
## LISSETTE: 
It’s OK it’s really OK 
---
I... Sometimes I... Like.  
---
Morbid?  
---
Conversations?  
---
I...
---
Sorry is that a weird thing to say out loud?  
---
Sometimes I say things out loud 
---
and literally as I’m saying it 
---
I’m like why are you saying that 
---
weird thing you’re saying. 
---
## PETER: 
I like morbid conversations. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I like true crime shit.   
---
## PETER: 
I binge watch SVU all the time.

## PETER: 
How about Lissette’s Mom

## CHERYL: 
That’s a shitty title.

## PETER: 
I will think of something.

## CHERYL: 
Make it good. 
---
## PETER: 
I will.  
---
Try my best.

## CHERYL:

This is.

It’s an important day.   
---
## PETER: 
I know.

## CHERYL: 
I’m not gonna get a wedding so.

You gotta give me this.

## PETER: 
Why don’t you make something?

---
What kind of freaking idiot thing is that?

## PETER: 
No like cooking.

## PETER: 
Whatever you want.  
---
You can make.  
---
Whatever you want. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Yeah OK.

---
## CHERYL: 
How many? 
---
## PETER:

---
## CHERYL: 
How many lasagnas?
---
## PETER: 
Oh!  Um...

One with sausages and one without sausages. 
---
## PETER: 
Sounds like a plan. 
---
## CHERYL: 
I need to make a list.  
---
You got a pen I wanna jot myself a note? 
---
## PETER: 
I mean this is all in the 
---
unforeseeable future.  
---
We don’t even have a date. 
---
We’re just.    
---
## CHERYL: 
Petey. 
---
## PETER: 
Huh? 
---
## CHERYL: 
What’s this we business?  
---
template: overlap
## PETER: 
I am working with Lissette to plan the party. 

## CHERYL: 
I knew it!  
---
You are the host!  
---
Just admit it you’re the host. 
---
## PETER: 
For the last time Cheryl.  
---
There is.  
---
No host. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Lissette knows I throw a good party.  
---
She should just let me do it 
---
and make it nice for her. 
---
## PETER: 
You would.  
Everybody knows that. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Why are you telling me anyway? 
---
Why isn’t my kid telling me herself?
---
## PETER: 
I mean I think it’s too weird? 
---
## CHERYL: 
Weird what?
---
## PETER: 
For Lissette.  To...  
---
I mean she hasn’t said 
---
anything to me about it.  
---
But...  
---
I think it’d be weird to talk to your mom about...  
---
The event.  
---
The event of the party I think.  
---
She isn't trying to 
---
exclude you I think. 
---
## CHERYL: 
We didn’t always get along 
---
me and her but we worked it out.  
---
I thought we worked it out 
---
and I just. 
---
## PETER: 
Listen to me.  
---
This isn’t 
---
she isn’t trying to hurt you.  
---
OK? 
---
It’s just... 
---
You shouldn’t have to plan this, Cheryl.  
---
Right?  
---
You should get to just.   
---
Show up.    
---
---
## CHERYL: 
You are a good kid, Petey.   
---
## PETER: 
Thank you Cheryl. 
---
## CHERYL: 
I hope Lissette appreciates
---
everything you do for her.  
---
I know from personal experience 
---
that she sometimes forgets to say 
---
thank you despite being raised 
better.   
---
## PETER: 
I’m not keeping score.   
---
## CHERYL: 
That’s very good. 
---
Scorekeeping in relationships.  
---
All relationships.  
---
Is death. 
---
I useta try to tell my first 
---
ex husband that but believe you me.  
---
That man kept meticulous score.  
---
Couldn’t remember my birthday or 
---
pick up his own freaking drawers 
---
but I swear to God 
---
he could itemize every time 
---
he washed a goddamn dish. 
---
## CHERYL: 
You need to find someone.  
---
You take good care.  
---
But who takes care of you, huh? 
---
## PETER: 
Yeah I mean sure.   
---
## CHERYL: 
Did she tell you that you hadda 
---
talk to me or did you volunteer? 
---
## PETER: 
She didn’t tell me 
---
she asked if I would do it 
---
and I said I would do it. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Why would you ever say yes to that? 
---
## PETER: 
Because.  
She’s my best friend and I. 
---
## CHERYL: 
This is terrible task she gave. 
---
## PETER: 
And because I.  
---
Really care about you.   
---
## CHERYL: 
I always wanted a son.  
---
Son’s take care of their mothers.  
---
Do you take care of your mother? 
---
## PETER: 
My mother’s dead. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Mine too.    
---
Was your’s an asshole?  
---
Mine was kind of an asshole. 
---
## PETER: 
My mother? 
---
## CHERYL: 
Yeah. 
---
## PETER: 
She was complicated.   
---
## CHERYL: 
Mine told me I was going to hell 
---
at least five times a year 
---
and I still made sure they changed 
---
her diapers in the home so.  
---
What else are you gonna do, right? 
---
## CHERYL: 
You want?  
---
I only like pineapple. 
---
## PETER: 
You gotta cherry one? 
---
## CHERYL: 
When I was a kid I useta pick out 
---
all the pineapples 
---
and throw the rest in the garbage.  
---
Drove my asshole mother nuts.
---
[little laugh]
---
Who do you think came up with that huh?  
---
Lime, lemon I get.  
---
But pineapple.
[laughing]  
---
Crazy.    
---
What kinda candy did you like 
---
when you were a kid, Petey?  
---
## PETER: 
Big League Chew. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Isn’t that gum? 
---
## PETER: 
Yeah. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Gum’s not candy 
---
what was your favorite candy? 
---
## PETER: 
I think I liked plain old Hershey Bars. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Yeah those were the same 
---
when I was a kid too.  
---
You’re an old soul.

## PETER:

Oh my god fuck you! 
---
## PETER: 
No seriously what did you do?

Because I know you.

## PETER: 
I’m not judging!

## LISSETTE: 
What kind of bullshit is that

making an assumption

that I fucking did something?   
---
## PETER: 
Why are you surprised

that I would ask that???

## PETER: 
Don’t give me that look.

## LISSETTE: 
Don’t micromanage my expressions.

template: overlap
## PETER: 
You are making a big deal out of minutiae.  

## LISSETTE: 
I’m not giving you a look!

## PETER: 
You can’t see your face!  
---
It is a subliminal look! 
---
## LISSETTE: 
That’s not an actual thing. 
---
## PETER: 
Are you denying that you 
---
are a person who seems to  
---
Find drama? 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I wouldn’t call it drama 
---
template: overlap
## LISSETTE:
I would just. 

## PETER: 
Are you forgetting the time

I helped you hack into your

template: overlap
## PETER:
boss’s email account to intercept. 

## LISSETTE: 
Yes I know I was there! 
---
## PETER: 
To intercept an email

where you told him

that he and his fucking ass-grabbing, 
---
misogynist, self could

## LISSETTE: 
Please stop telling me about 
---
things that I already know about! 
---
## PETER: 
Or what about 
---
the fucking pregnant pig.  
---
Are you forgetting the pregnant pig? 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I refuse to engage 
---
in this conversation with you. 
---
## PETER: 
We can’t let a pregnant pig 
---
be turned into bacon, Peter!  
---
We have to save the pregnant pig! 
---
## LISSETTE: 
IT WAS A VERY GOOD THING THAT WE DID THAT. 
---
## PETER: 
I agree but still. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Petunia is on a farm 
---
and living a wonderful life 
---
And got to have her babies 
---
surrounded by fucking vegans.  
---
And it’s all because of us. 
---
## PETER: 
Dude we stole a fucking pig! 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Sometimes a bad deed is fine 
---
if it’s for the greater good. 
---
## PETER: 
What if that pig was supposed to die? 
---
What if it’s some kind of bullshit 
---
where you go back in time 
---
and you change things 
---
and then you create a dystopian 
---
future because of it. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
OK I love you 
---
and I see where you’re going with that.  
---
But.  
---
We didn’t fuck up the world 
---
because we saved Petunia.  
---
God wasn’t like.  
---
You know what?  
---
The world needs more bacon 
---
and because Peter and Lissette 
---
messed shit up 
---
I am going destroy everything.

That definitly didn’t happen. 
---
## PETER: 
OK fine but I’m just saying 
---
that it shouldn’t be surprising 
---
to you that when you say.

“Don’t freak out.”

I respond with.

“What did you do.”

## PETER: 
Ok, now will you tell me 
what you wanted to tell me. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Oh right, that. 
---
## PETER: 
Because I am bursting at the seams with curiosity. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
You have to promise not to be weird about it. 
---
Because it's not like it's a big deal or anything. 
---
## PETER:
Oh my God just fucking tell me. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Ok, OK!
---
So, uh
---
So, I did what you told me to do 
---
and I went to the doctor 
---
to figure out what’s up with my leg 
---
and my hands and why I keep 
---
falling down and she. 
---
## PETER: 
Finally. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
And she sent me to a specialist 
---
and so I went to the specialist and they. 
---
template: overlap
## PETER: 
Did you tell me you were doing that? 

## LISSETTE: 
No?  
---
No, I don’t think?  
---
Anyway they did all these tests 
like lots of tests and they. 
---
## PETER: 
Good good. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
And they kept saying that thing 
they say 
---
that doctors say that.  
---
Don’t worry they say 
---
everything’s fine 
---
you’re fine 
---
we just need to see this and that 
---
and I kept freaking out 
---
that my shitty insurance 
---
wouldn’t cover all of it 
---
because my deductible is so huge. 
---
## PETER: 
You need to do the tests 
if the doctors want tests. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I know I know!  
I did the tests.
---
I was just freaking out because it’s gonna be 
---
a lot of money that’s all I’m saying.  
---
I took the tests.    
---
I took all the endless tests and.    
---
And then I waited for what felt like forever. 
---
And I kept trying to call back 
---
to find out what the results were 
---
but I couldn't get a person on the phone
---
then finally last week someone

finally called me back and they were like 
---
can you come in?    
---
Um.   
---
It’s never good when they want you to come in.  
---
I kept trying to get them to tell me 
---
what it was over the phone 
but they wouldn’t. 
---
They just kept saying
---
"Ok, we'll transfer you to the receptionist". 
---
Like they didn’t even hear me.  
---
Like in my head I thought I was screaming 
---

## LISSETTE:
but maybe it was just in my head?  

## PETER: 
Is it a torn ligament? 
---
## LISSETTE: 
It’s not a torn ligament. 
---
## PETER: 
Did you get an CT SCAN? 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I didn’t get an CT SCAN. 
---
## PETER: 
You need to get an CT SCAN.  
---
Don’t try to save money if you need an MRI you need to.   
---
## LISSETTE: 
OH MY GOD PETER 
I DON’T NEED A FUCKING CT SCAN! 
---
---
## LISSETTE: 
I'm Sorry.  
---
template: overlap
## LISSETTE:
I didn’t mean to. 

## PETER: 
It’s OK. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Um. So,   
---
So...   
---
So yesterday I went back in 
---
and they sat me down 
---
and they tried to act like 
---
everything wasn’t a disaster 
---
## PETER: 
What’s wrong?  
---
template: overlap
## LISSETTE: 
See, You’re getting worried and I need you

## PETER: 
WHAT’S FUCKING WRONG? 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Peter I am this close to 100 percent freaking out 
---
and so I need you to not freak 
out 
---
because I need today 
---
I need you to act like there's nothing wrong. 
---
with anything I’m about to tell you.  
---
If I see your face freak out 
---
I’m gonna full on fall apart.   
---
But if you shrug and say 
---
it’s not as bad as you think it is.  
---
If you do that for me.  
---
Today.  
---
I will be OK   
---
I’m gonna need to tell my mom 
---
I don’t know how to tell my mom.  
---
And she is going to.  
---
I mean.  
---
I just. 
---
Before I rally
---
and get my shit together
---
and figure out what I'm gonna do next 
---
I just need one fucking day.   
---
Where I can pretend 
---
like none of this 
---
is has happened.  
---
And so if I say it out loud 
---
and you don’t blink 
---
you just take it in 
---
if you do that for just for today.  
---
I can pretend it’s OK. 
---
I just need today to pretend today that it’s OK. 
---
## PETER: 
OK. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
And then I need to drink a lot of alcohol 
---
and smoke like a pack of cigarettes.  
---
I need to drink till I pass out. 
---
## PETER: 
All right.  
---
I can do that.    
---
Margaritas. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Yes please. 
---
## PETER: 
Like those stupid mango frozen margaritas.  
---
Pitchers. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
With salt. 
---
## PETER: 
And guac. 
---
template: overlap
## LISSETTE: 
Yes yes to all of this yes. 

## PETER: 
We are going to drink all the 
---
margaritas and eat all the guac. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Can I sleep over?
---
## PETER: 
Yes. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Can I sleep in your bed with you?
---
## PETER: 
Yes. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I know I kick in my sleep 
---
and steal all the sheets. 
---
## PETER: 
You can sleep in my bed with me. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Can I sleep over for a very long time? 
---
## PETER: 
Yes. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Thank you. 
---
## PETER: 
Sure. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Tell me it’s gonna be OK. 
---
## PETER: 
It’s gonna be OK.  
---
It’s all gonna be OK.   
---
## LISSETTE: 
OK. 
---
## PETER: 
OK. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
OK.

template: music

## CHERYL: 
You’ll have to come home with me to Woburn. 
---
template: overlap
## LISSETTE: 
Yeah I will not actually be doing that. 

## CHERYL: 
There’s no room for me here. 
---
template: overlap
## LISSETTE: 
Nobody is asking you to uproot your life for this. 

## CHERYL: 
What’re you gonna do then huh?  
---
template: overlap
## Cheryl
How’re you gonna manage by yourself? 

## LISSETTE: 
I have friends, Ma.  
---
template: overlap
## LISSETTE:
I have a really good group of friends. 

## CHERYL: 
How are you gonna get up 
---
five flights of stairs? 
---
Did you think about that? 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Of course I have! 
---
## CHERYL: 
You can barely lift a fork right now 
---
template: overlap
## CHERYL:
how are you gonna? 
---
## LISSETTE: 
OK that’s dramatic.  
---
I can definitely lift a fork.   
---
## CHERYL: 
You gonna teleport yourself?  
---
Up the stairs? 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I haven’t thought that far ahead! 
---
## CHERYL: 
Well you gotta get outta denial sweetheart.  
---
Because I can tell you right now. 
---
Nobody’s gonna carry you 
---
up five flights of stairs.    
---
I love you. 
---
I love you with every fiber of my being.  
---
But my knees just can’t do it.  
---
So... 
---
We gotta have a plan. 
---
## LISSETTE:  
This isn’t a “we” situation 
---
## LISSETTE:
it’s a “me” situation 
---
## CHERYL: 
My condo is on one floor.  
---
template: overlap
## CHERYL:
You’ll be able to get around easy. 

## LISSETTE: 
Oh god that’s depressing, Ma. 
---
## CHERYL: 
It’s not!  
---
It’s a very cheery condo! 
---
## LISSETTE: 
But I’d be stuck in Woburn.   
---
## CHERYL: 
There is a lot to do in Woburn, Missy.   
---
## LISSETTE:
[laughs]
---
## CHERYL:
What you’re a big shot, huh?  
---
You too fancy pants for Woburn. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Yeah.  
---
I am definitely too fancy pants for Woburn, Ma. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Woburn is a lovely place to live. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
It is.  
---
It is a lovely place to live.  
---
For you.    
---
I spent my entire life 
---
trying to get out of Woburn, Ma.  
---
I definitely don’t want to.  
---
Die.  There.   
---
## LISSETTE: 
Don’t be insulted. 
---
## CHERYL: 
I’m not insulted. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
You look insulted...
---
## CHERYL: 
Nope!  
---
Not at all not one bit.   
---
## LISSETTE: 
Yeah OK. 
---
## CHERYL: 
I just think that maybe. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Here we go. 
---
## CHERYL: 
That you judge a little bit.   
---
## LISSETTE: 
OK. 
---
## CHERYL: 
And you need a plan because.   
---
## LISSETTE: 
Peter is gonna stay with me.
---
That’s the plan.   
---
## CHERYL: 
What kinda cockamamie plan is that? 
---
template: overlap
## LISSETTE: 
When and if I need somebody to live with me.

## CHERYL: 
Peter???  
---
That is a huge imposition on Peter! 
---
## LISSETTE: 
He offered!  
---
I didn’t ask. 
---
## CHERYL: 
You two are too intimate 
---
for platonic friends.   
---
## LISSETTE: 
I don’t even know what that means. 
---
## CHERYL: 
It means that you two are too close for for for. 
---
For non romantic partners. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
So only people with romantic partners 
---
get to have help when they get sick?  
---
Is that it?
---
## CHERYL: 
I told you that you can. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Single people should just.  
Die alone.  
---
template: overlap
## LISSETTE:
Is that what you think? 

## CHERYL: 
I didn’t say that! 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Both of us are single right now 
---
## CHERYL: 
Maybe that’s why. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Maybe what’s why. 
---
## CHERYL: 
You two are single.  
---
Because there isn’t any room 
---
for anybody else. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
If I can’t judge Woburn 
---
you can’t judge my friendship with Peter! 
---
## CHERYL: 
I’m just saying that maybe 
---
if you two put some space 
---
in-between there 
---
you would find someone. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I think the opportunity for that 
---
has passed for me and so. 
---
## CHERYL: 
But what about him?   
---
Maybe he wants to find someone. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I want him to find someone. 
---
## CHERYL: 
How’s he gonna find someone 
---
if he’s living here with you 
---
and carrying you up 
---
the fucking stairs! 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Peter finding someone 
---
or not finding someone 
---
has nothing to do with him 
---
possibly moving in here 
---
if I need help at some point. 
---
## CHERYL: 
It’s not an if! 
---
## LISSETTE: 
They said it could be slow moving 
---
and so you.  
---
## CHERYL: 
Honey. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
You don’t know!  
---
Noone knows! 
---
## CHERYL: 
Is Peter gonna give you a bath 
when you need it? 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Sure. 
---
template: overlap
## CHERYL: 
He gonna wipe your ass? 

## LISSETTE: 
Oh my god. 
---
## CHERYL: 
I wiped that ass once 
---
I can wipe it again. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Can we stop talking about
---
people wiping my ass please! 
---
## CHERYL: 
You need a plan.  
---
This I know one hundred percent.   
---
## LISSETTE: 
You mean I need to do your plan! 
---
## CHERYL: 
You live in a five flight walk up!  
---
You are 
---
you are 
---
you are 
---
you are
---
[frustration shout]

whatever happens 
---
you are not gonna 
---
be able to get up five flights 
---
of stairs anymore.  
---
Not with me 
---
not with Peter 
---
not with your fairy fucking godmother.  
---
That’s not my plan 
that’s not your plan 
---
I don’t want to believe it’s God’s fucking plan 
---
but it’s happening so.  
---
I don’t give a rats ass 
---
what you want to do 
---
but you can’t live here anymore.  
---
and facts are 
---
that whether this fucker is slow moving 
---
or fast moving this apartment 
---
is no longer an option for you anymore.
---
Are you listening to me?  
---
## LISSETTE: 
Yes I’m listening.  
---
Of course I’m listening.  
---
I’m always listening.   
---
## CHERYL: 
What’s that supposed to mean. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I donno Ma.  
---
You’re hard not.  
---
To hear.   
---
## CHERYL: 
You mean I’m loud? 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Yeah. 
---
## CHERYL: 
You’re loud too. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Yeah I Know.   
---
Because I always haveta yell.  
---
To get heard.    
---
## CHERYL:
It’s good for a woman to be loud.  
---
What you wanna be a 
---
milquetoast wallflower 
---
like your cousin Jeanine? 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Yeah no 
---
I definitely don’t wanna be 
---
like Jeanine.

## LISSETTE: 
OK.

---

---
you had when you were a little girl.  
---
Like.  
---
When you were nine months old 
and you.  
---
And you outta nowhere 
---
decided you wanted to walk.  
---
Just woke up one day

Freaking world.

## LISSETTE: 
I wanna stay in New York.
---
I don’t wanna go to Woburn. 
---
## CHERYL: 
But if you...  
---
## LISSETTE: 
I’ll move to an apartment 
---
with an elevator 
---
or on a ground floor 
---
whatever I haveta do.  
---
But I wanna stay here.  
---
Where my life is
---
where my friends are.  
---
I wanna work till I.

## CHERYL: 
At a bar??? 
---
How are you gonna work at a bar??? 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Yes in a bar, Ma yes!  
---
## CHERYL: 
This is a shitty plan. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I don’t care what you think, Ma 
---
this is the plan 
---
this is the only plan!! 
---
And... and 
---
and fuck 
---
and you can find a way 
---
to be OK with it 
---
or you can not do that 
---
and not see me OK?  
---
But either way 
---
I am gonna live my life 
---
the way I wanna live it 
---
till I hit a motherfucking brick wall 
---
and can’t anymore 
---
and then I’ll.  
---
I don’t know what I’ll do 
---
I’ll figure that out when I get there 
---
I.    
---
Look.  
---
There is gonna be a time 
---
when I can't move 
---
or talk or fight with you anymore. 
---
so before that happens 
---
I need you to hear me NOW 
---
saying what I’m saying to 
you.   
---
## CHERYL: 
Yeah yeah.   
---
## LISSETTE: 
No yeah yeah Ma 
---
I need you to promise me
---
that you will always.  
---
Whatever I decide.  
---
Even if you think it’s batshit crazy. 
---
That you will respect my wishes. 
---
## CHERYL: 
But what if?
---
## LISSETTE: 
Ma, I need you to promise me 
---
that you will always respect my wishes. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Fine I will
---
“respect your wishes.”   
---
## LISSETTE: 
Even if you don’t agree with them. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Sure, yeah, that too. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Even when I can’t yell at all.  
---
You will still need to.  
---
Find a way to listen.

## PETER: 
Sorry I wasn’t thinking about that.

## LISSETTE: 
It’s OK.

## CHERYL: 
If we move to my condo in Woburn.

## CHERYL: 
OK baby we can do that. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Alone.   
---
## CHERYL: 
That’s fine.  
---
I will take you home 
---
and then I will... 
---
Go to a movie!  
---
Petey you wanna go to a movie? 
---
## PETER: 
Sure lets go to a movie. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I wanna get myself home. 
---
By myself. 
---

You wanna get treated like an adult?  Huh?

Stop acting like a

freaking two year old.  
---
There are times in this world 
---
when we gotta accept help from 
---
other people even if it sucks so 
---
get over yourself and accept it.  
---
You hear me?    
---
We’re taking you home.   
---
And I’m not leaving you alone 
---
you can fucking be shitty about it 
---
and complain all you want.  
---
I’m making the plan 
---
and you’re gonna deal with it.  
---
Capiche?    
---
Petey can you help me get her in a cab? 
---
## PETER: 
Yeah. 
---
## CHERYL: 
We gotta get her a cab
---
and then we gotta carry her 
---
up the stairs to her apartment. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I’m sorry. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Nothing to be sorry about kiddo 
---
we got this.  
---
## LISSETTE:
I'm so sorry. I'm so so sorry.
---
## CHERYL:
enough with the sorry business
---
Petey?   
---
We got her, right?
---
## PETER: 
Right.

## CHERYL:

## PETER: 
Are you sure we should be doing this?

## LISSETTE: 
Oh my god stop worrying! 
---
## PETER: 
It feels illegal, like we’re breaking in. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Dude!  I have keys!  
---
We didn’t break in. 
---
## PETER: 
I know but still. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Oh for fuck’s sake 
---
I work here 
---
this is practically my bar 
---
we didn’t break in.  
---
Would you rather go back 
---
to that shitty party Pete
---
where your asshole date 
---
Donnovan ditched you? 
---
template: overlap
## PETER: 
He really is a douchebag isn’t he?

## LISSETTE: 
He is a ginormous douchebag Pete!  
---
So would you rather go back 
---
to  that shitty party playing a sad game 
---
of charades with Allison’s 
---
weird work friends or?
---
## PETER: 
I need to stop dating douchebags! 
---
## LISSETTE: 
STOP DATING DOUCHEBAGS 
---
YES!  
---
Or would you rather sit in an after hours bar 
---
and have the woman 
---
who Food and Wine just named 
---
the “future of bespoke cocktails”  make a?
---
## PETER: 
Is that true?  
---
That is very impressive. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Yes it’s true or would?
---
## PETER: 
You’re a celebrity! 
---
## LISSETTE: 
SHHHHH.  
---
I’m not a celebrity. 
---
## PETER: 
Sorry sorry I’ll stop interrupting. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
It’s OK It’s OK.  
---
Or would you rather have that woman 
---
ie me 
---
I am that woman 
---
make a custom specialty 
---
“bespoke” cocktail just for you. 
---
## PETER: 
I would definitely prefer 
---
option number two. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Good choice Pete.  
---
Lean into having an.  
---
Epic adventure. 
---
## PETER: 
Yeah OK. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
That flutter in your stomach Pete
---
is what it feels to be alive.  
---
We are so lucky to be alive!  
---
Doesn’t it feel great??? 
---
## PETER: 
I donno I think I might vomit. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
On your deathbed Pete.  
---
Do you wanna be thinking 
---
fuck I should have done 
---
more things that scare me?  
---
Fuck that shit.  
---
That shit sucks.  
---
Regrets suck.  
---
Devour life!  
---
Next time we’re doing Absinthe.  
---
But I can already tell 
---
I need to take baby steps with you.    
---
OK, look me in the eye. 
---
## PETER: 
Looking someone in the eye is a little intense. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Agreed.  
---
But you have to look someone
---
in the eye when you toast 
---
or you are cursed 
---
with 7 years of bad sex.  
---
OK... 
---
Raise your glass.    
---
Here’s to...
---
Living in the moment.  
---
And.  
---
New friends.  
---
And.  
---
Seven years of fucking amazing 
sex.  
---
And.  
---
Many many adventures. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
No no not yet! 
---
## PETER: 
Ahhh sorry sorry! 
---
## LISSETTE: 
S’OK.    
---
For my cousin Ruthie.  
---
For Joey Curtis. 
---
For Drea Antonetti.  
---
For my dead Gram.  
---
Not the one with Altzheimers.  
---
For my Aunt Charleene.  
---
You got anybody? 
---
## PETER: 
Huh? 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Dead.  
---
Anybody dead you wanna toast to. 
---
## PETER: 
Oh...
---
Um I donno. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
It’s not a requirement or anything 
---
it’s just something I do 
---
if you wanna do it too 
---
I’m.  Opening the floor. 
---
## PETER: 
My mom.  
---
Maybe.    
---
For my mom. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
And for Peter’s mom.

May you all rest in Peace.

Wow that’s good.

I told you Pete!  
---
See what happens 
---
when you remain open to possibilities? 
---
## PETER: 
I do see.  
---
I am currently reevaluating 
---
all of my life choices. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I am gonna call this drink a... 
---
I am calling it a.  
---
A Motherfucking Shitfucker! 
---
## PETER: 
That’s quite a title. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
It feels good to say.  
---
Say it. 
---
## PETER: 
Motherfucking Shitfucker. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Sometimes cursing is so satisfying.

OK so the Motherfucking Shitfucker 
has.

Are you ready?

## PETER: 
I am ready.

Tequila.

Grapefruit.

Splash of soda.

It’s like a Paloma

with a kick in the shins.

Like she’s refreshing

and bright and light 
---
and charming 
---
and then all of a sudden 
---
outta nowhere 
---
when you least expect it 
---
template: overlap
## LISSETTE:
she kicks you in the shins. 

## PETER: 
She kicks you in the shins. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
YES!  
---
OK so I’m gonna be honest with you Pete.  
---
Can I call you Pete? 
---
OK? 
---
Is that?
---
## PETER: 
OH!  
---
Um...
---
Well it’s not my favorite but it’s. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Sorry! 
---
## PETER: 
But it’s OK.    
---
This Motherfucking Shitfucker 
---
is kind of extraordinary. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Aw Pete.  
---
I may love you a little. 
---
## PETER: 
Are we there yet? 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Sure why not Pete 
---
why not I mean maybe Pete?  
---
Maybe.  
---
Maybe you and me 
---
maybe we are going to be such 
---
wicked fucking good friends 
---
from now on 
---
now for forever from now, right? 
---
## PETER: 
I have no idea 
---
what you just said 
---
but sure. 
---
## LISSSETTE:
So Pete. 
---
## PETER: 
Lissette. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Tell me something about you 
---
that’s secret and exciting. 
---
## PETER: 
I’m not sure that I have. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
One thing!!  
---
That nobody knows about.  
---
Except for me now 
---
I’ll know and you will also know 
---
because it’s your thing to know. 
---
## PETER: 
It’s hard to think of something 
---
that nobody knows. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
ONE THING! 
---
## PETER:
OK FINE! 
---
## PETER: 
Nobody knows.  
---
Nobody knows that...  
---
I have never smoked weed. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
How old are you??? 
---
## PETER: 
I just turned thirty. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Happy Birthday! 
---
## PETER: 
Thank you! 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Oh! I need to get you a present 
---
where is a present 
---
template: overlap
## LISSETTE:
I need to find you a present. 

## PETER: 
Really not necessary. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Oh!  
---
OK get ready 
---
you ready? 
---
## PETER: 
I’m ready. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
This. 
---
This is my bicentennial 
---
It is very special 
---
and very lucky.  
---
Here. 
---
## PETER: 
Thanks. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
This penny.  
---
Was found on the corner 
---
of Broadway and 12th street 
---
in front of the Strand Bookstore 
---
after a really unfortunate date 
---
with an investment banker 
---
that Allison set me up with.  
---
I am giving you this penny 
---
as a token of our new best friendship.  
---
You Pete you.  
---
Are now the Luckiest Person.  
---
In the Entire World. 
---
## PETER: 
That’s a little overwhelming. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
But wait 
---
why have you never smoked weed? 
---
## PETER: 
Oh!   
Right. 
That.   
---
I have never actually done 
---
any drugs of any kind.  
---
I’ve barely popped a Tylenol.  
---
I maybe have never taken a Tylenol. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I’ve done all the drugs there are to do.  
---
I’ve tried everything once.  
---
I kind of wish I haven’t but I have 
so what can you do?   
---
Why is it a secret? 
---
## PETER:  
I mean, I guess it’s a little embarrassing? 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Why?
---
## PETER: 
Because it’s something that... 
---
Most people our age have experienced.
---
## LISSETTE: 
Who gives a shit what other people have experienced? 
---
## PETER: 
I guess It’s just. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
You are dodging the question Pete.  
---
Why have you never smoked weed?
---
## PETER: 
I have never smoked weed 
---
because there are a lot of people in my life 
---
who Were High?  
---
A lot  
---
And I don’t want to be. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
But you drink. 
---
## PETER: 
Cleary I do. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
What’s the difference?   
---
## PETER: 
If it’s OK I would... 
---
Rather not talk about it? 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Sorry sorry of course it’s OK. 
---
## PETER: 
It’s no big deal 
---
I just. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
No no this is me 
---
I do this 
---
I just.  
---
I barrel right over 
---
people’s boundaries and I. 
---
## PETER: 
I drink because I know 
---
I can stop drinking.  
---
I don't do drugs because 
---
I’m not sure I’d be able to stop 
---
doing drugs.  
---
And because a lot of people 
---
in my family drink 
---
and are functional.  
---
But those who do drugs are not.  
---
Functional.  
---
Or they are dead.  
---
So 
---
That’s why I drink 
---
but don’t do drugs. 
---
## PETER: 
What about you?
---
## LISSETTE: 
I already told you.  
---
I have done all the drugs there are to do so. 
---
## PETER: 
No, what’s your biggest secret? 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Oh. 
---
## PETER: 
What’s something about you 
nobody knows?
---
## LISSETTE: 
My. Biggest Secret.  
---
Pete is.  
---
Um, that nobody has ever told me 
---
that they love me.  
---
Ever.  
---
Like besides my mom.  
And I donno.  
---
Maybe my dead gram said it once.  
---
But.  
---
I’ve never been in love.  
---
And so I’ve never said 
---
those words to someone.  
---
Or had them said to me. 
---
## PETER: 
Me neither. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
What’s your biggest fear? 
---
## PETER: 
Dying alone. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
You didn’t even hesitate. 
---
## PETER: 
Oh yeah, that particular fear is like.  
---
Omnipresent in my life.  
---
It’s really specific too.  
---

## PETER:
I choke on a chicken bone and die. 

## LISSETTE: 
Wait, why a chicken bone?  
---
template: overlap
## LISSETTE:
That’s so random. 

## PETER: 
I know but it’s just 
---
always a chicken bone. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
OK I’m going with it. 
---
## PETER: 
And yeah so I choke on the 
---
rogue chicken bone 
---
and I die and nobody 
---
finds me till my neighbors 
---
start to complain about 
template: overlap
## PETER:
the smell. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
The smell.  
---
Yeah that’s a good one. 
---
## PETER: 
What about you? 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Oh, um  
---
Mine is lame.  
---
Mine is. 
---
People reading my journals 
---
after I die. 
---
## PETER: 
Oh no, that’s horrifying! 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Right?  
---
Like people you love 
---
going through your journals 
---
and reading weird shit you’ve said  about them and.  
---
Getting hurt. It’s the worst!  
---
So I’m always in this insane 
push pull of do I destroy them 
---
all while I’m alive?  
---
But then what if I want to read them again?  
---
Does any of it matter? 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I’m blushing. 
---
## PETER: 
You are. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I’m clearly embarrassed. 
---
## PETER: 
Why? 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I don’t know!  
---
But I am. 
---
---
## PETER: 
Even though we barely know each other.  
---
I promise you here.  
---
Over this Motherfucking Shitfucker.  
---
That should you suddenly 
---
and unexpectedly die.  
---
I will go into your apartment 
---
and I will steal all your journals 
---
and I will shred all of them 
---
and I can say that because we’ve 
---
just met and so there will probably 
---
be nothing about me in them. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
But now that we’re best friends 
---
there may be lots of shitty stuff 
---
about you in the future. 
---
## PETER: 
That’s OK.  
---
I can handle.  
---
Shitty stuff. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Oh, that might be the nicest thing 
---
anybody has ever said to me.  
---
Like maybe in my whole life. 
---
## PETER: 
I totally mean it. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Thank you. 
---
## PETER: 
Sure.

Didn’t your mother tell you 
---
not to creep up on people like that. 
---
## PETER: 
Sorry I’m sorry I’m. 
---
## CHERYL: 
You better shut your mouth 
---
and not tell a damn soul 
---
that you saw me smoking out here. 
---
## PETER: 
I won’t, I promise. 
---
## CHERYL: 
I know I probably reek of the fuckers 
---
but nobody needs to hear 
---
I had a witness.  
---
Capiche? 
---
## PETER: 
Yes.  
---
Fully Capiche-ed. 
---
## CHERYL: 
You found this place right? 
---
## PETER: 
I did. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Aw kid you did good.  
---
It's gorgeous here. 
---
## PETER: 
Air B N B. 
---
## CHERYL: 
What kinda asshole puts this place 
---
on the internet for complete strangers? 
---
Could you do that? 
---
## PETER: 
Probably not. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Yeah, me neither
---
But good thing the owner of this place isn't you and me right?
---
## PETER:
Yeah, definitly.
---
## CHERYL:
You know, as grateful as I am 
---
for my idiot cousin Joey 
---
giving his address and everything.
---
## PETER:
Yeah. Yeah.
---
## CHERYL:
Thank God we aren't sitting around his shithole house 
---
in Ruttlin right now with all his frickin Sox memorabilia, right?
---
That wouldn't have felt like a party.
---
## PETER: 
Agreed.
---
## CHERYL: 
It would've been very depressing
---
And this
---
Is a special day.
---
So it should be in a special place
---
and you made it nice for her
---
Better than I would have
---
So, thank you.
---
## PETER:
Sure
---
## CHERYL:
Speaking for depressing,
---
I tried to go in the crying room 
---
which, no offense Petey 
---
and pardon my French 
---
the crying room 
---
is really frickin shit show.  
---
## PETER: 
Yeah, I'm not sure that was a good idea. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Yeah, I know you meant well
---
and I gave it a try
---
But I just sat there 
---
like an asshole
---
then that annoying girl 
---
who sang that horrible 
---
Bette Midler song.
---
## PETER: 
Allison. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Right Allison.  
---
Allison tried to freaking hug me.  
---
And then my sister Annette 
---
started telling me about her 
---
goddamn knee replacement.  
---
Who does that?  
---
Like I want to hear about that today? 
---
But so I had to get 
---
the hell outta there and so I.  
---
I came out here.  
---
Talked to my dead mother.    
---
I mean who knows if she 
---
hears anything but I felt like 
---
taking a chance. 
---
So...
---
---
## CHERYL: 
OK well, I should go back, huh?  
---
Let you be alone. 
---
## PETER: 
You can stay.  
---
If you want, you can stay.  
---
You don’t have to 
---
if you don’t want to 
---
but if you want to 
---
I’m OK with you 
---
staying out here too.  
---
If you Want.  
---
If you don't, no pressure, you can go inside.  
---
If you want. 
---
## CHERYL: 
You mind if I have another ciggy? 
---
## PETER: 
Only if you have one for me. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Petey you smoke??? 
---
## PETER: 
Sometimes. 
---
## CHERYL: 
That made me like you 
---
a little more.  
---
And I already like you quite a bit. 
---
## PETER: 
Are these?  
---
Do you smoke?  
---
Virginia Slims? 
---
## CHERYL: 
I do 
---
I know it’s embarrassing. 
---
## PETER: 
I mean it’s actually 
---
kind of amazing.  
---
It made me like you a little more.  
---
And I already like you quite a bit. 
---
---
## PETER: 
Are these even?  
---
Do they have nicotine in them 
---
or are they just Decorative? 
---
## CHERYL: 
I donno.  
---
I’ve been smoking these 
---
since I was thirteen.  
---
I think I just like the 
---
whadyacallit.  
---
The hand mouth thing.  
---
I think it’s cuz I was bottle fed.  
---
I think I read that somewhere.

---
## PETER: 
People love the lasagna. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Oh come on.  
---
You’re just saying that. 
---
## PETER: 
I’m not.  
---
There is weeping over the lasagna.  
---
There are people right now 
---
in the, Pardon my French,in the shit show crying room.  
---
They are crying over that lasagna. 
---
That lasagna is a gift Cheryl.  
---
You done good. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Now you’re making fun. 
---
## PETER: 
I swear on my mother 
---
that I’m not.   
---
## CHERYL: 
Don’t swear on your mother 
---
that’s terrible. 
---
## PETER: 
Fine I swear on nobody dead 
---
that the lasagna is extraordinary. 
---
## CHERYL: 
It doesn’t touch my mother’s.  
---
My mother’s was a two-day affair. 
---
She made the sauce from scratch.  
---
The meatballs.  
---
That woman made her own 
---
freaking ricotta cheese.  
---
Hand cut noodles.  
---
Even at the end when her brain was pudding.  
---
I swear to god if I said.  
---
“Ma.  Make me a lasagna.”  
---
She’d make me a lasagna.  
---
And it would be perfect.    
---
---
## PETER: 
I gotta be honest with you Cheryl.  
---
This cigarette 
---
isn’t truly satisfying. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Yeah I know.  
---
It’s like a toothpick 
---
with a filter. 
---
---
## CHERYL: 
I know this sounds coo coo 
---
but I swear to god 
---
my mother is here.  
---
Today.  
---
I keep hearing her in my head saying.  
---
“I got the emphysema 
---
and you have the nerve to smoke Cheryl.  
---
Screw you.”     
---
Holy crap you see that. 
---
## PETER: 
What?
---
## CHERYL: 
Don’t move. 
---
## PETER: 
OK...
---
## CHERYL: 
Lookit that.  
---
You see her? 
---
## PETER: 
Oh yeah. 
---
## CHERYL: 
My Nana Marie useta say 
---
when you see a ladybug 
---
it’s somebody dead 
---
coming for a visit.   
---
## PETER: 
Huh. 
---
## CHERYL: 
That one’s definitely for you.   
---
## CHERYL: 
When didja lose your Mother, Petey?
---
Sorry is that a weird thing to ask? 
---
## PETER: 
No not at all. 
---
My mother died when I was in middle school. 
---
And so. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Oh shit you poor kid.   
---
## PETER: 
No no it’s OK. I’m OK.   
---
## CHERYL: 
I just assumed you were all grown up 
---
not a little one aw jeeze hon. 
---
Oh jeeze. I’m so sorry.  
---
## PETER: 
It’s OK.  
---
It was a long time ago I.  
---
I don’t really even remember 
---
that much about her.  
---
Anymore.  
---
So.  
---
It’s OK. 
---
## CHERYL: 
So who took care of you? 
---
## PETER: 
Um...
---
My sister and I.  
---
We lived with my grandparents 
---
for a bit and then... 
---
My grandfather died and so we.    
---
What am I doing?  
---
You don’t wanna hear all this. 
---
## CHERYL: 
I asked you about it remember.   
---
## PETER: 
I mean I. 
---
## CHERYL: 
I got a lotta loud crap in 
---
my head right now 
---
and I’d love to not hear it 
---
for a minute.  
---
So.  
---
Talk.   
---
## PETER: 
OK...
---
I...   
---
Now I feel pressured to make it 
---
an interesting story I.  
---
And it’s not.  
---
My uh my sister and I we. 
---
We lived with my grandparents 
---
and then my grandfather died 
---
and my grandmother couldn’t keep us  
---
She and I had different dads.  
---
And her dad was useless 
---
and mine was less useless 
---
so I took my sister 
---
and we lived with my dad 
---
for a little bit.  
---
And he was fine but also shitty.  
---
We moved in with my mom’s brother 
---
and it was fine.   
---
He had lots of kids so.  
---
So mostly we just tried to 
---
not get in the way?
---
And... 
---
I mean they were good people.  
---
They loved us?  
---
I think? 
---
They liked us OK.  
---
But it was also weird.    
---
And then I graduated 
---
and I went to college.  
---
My shitty father paid for that.  
---
But my sister just kind of.  
---
She didn’t graduate.  
---
She got pregnant.  
---
She gave the kid up.  
---
She’s kind of a mess.  
---
So.  Yeah.  
---
That’s my Family.   
---
## CHERYL: 
Family is fucking crazy. 
---
## PETER: 
Yeah?    
----
Yeah. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Here’s another shitty cigarette. 
---
## PETER:
Thanks.  
---
template: noise
quiet bird and smoking sounds

## CHERYL: 
If you ever wanna call me 
---
on you know like.  
---
Holidays.  
---
I would.  
---
I wouldn’t mind that.  
---
If you did that.   
---
## PETER: 
OK.   
---
OK. 
---
template: music

## PETER: 
I’m sorry 
---
## LISSETTE: 
It's okay. I get it. 
---
## PETER: 
I will help you guys with. 
---
With whatever you need and I’ll. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Sounds good. 
---
## PETER: 
Stop it. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Stop what. 
---
## PETER: 
Being so nice about it. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Oh my god, what do you want me to do? 
---
## PETER: 
Yell at me. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Would that make you feel better?
---
## PETER:
Yeah.
---
## LISSETTE:
Ok. Well, sorry I’m not going to do that. 
---
## PETER: 
I suck as a friend. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I didn’t say that.  
---
Did I say that? 
---
## PETER: 
No but I promised you.  
---
I said I would live with you 
and that 
---
## LISSETTE: 
It’s a lot.  
---
To ask of a friend.   
---
To. 
---
To be your caregiver I.
---
I mean, I thought you may bail, so  
---
## PETER: 
I’m sorry 
---
template: overlap
## PETER:
I’m so sorry.

## LISSETTE: 
Dude. It’s OK.  
---
I've been taking care of my own shit 
---
since I was fuckin nine, 
---
I'll figure it out.
---
My mom will come 
---
and live with me.  
---
Or I’ll hire somebody or something. 
---
## PETER: 
Can you afford that? 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I mean I’ll just whatever.  
---
I’ll max out my credit cards 
---
It’s fine.  
---
It’ll be.  
---
Fine. 
---
---
## PETER: 
I can help you find a great apartment? 
---
## PETER: 
This is something I can do. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Sure. 
---
## PETER: 
Everybody should have 
---
in their life.  
---
A doctor 
---
a lawyer 
---
a dentist 
---
and a real estate agent. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Sounds like a plan. 
---
## PETER: 
What are you thinking?  
---
Two bedroom?
---
Lots of light?  
---
Downtown uptown? 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Uh, I just need it to be.  
---
Accessible. 
---
Yeah.  
---
And two bedrooms.  
---
And a.  
---
I need a.  
---
Month to month lease?  
---
## PETER: 
Why do you need a month to month lease? 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Peter... 
---
## PETER: 
I’m not trying to be difficult but I. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Think about it.  
---
Just.  
---
Think about it.  
---
---
## PETER: 
When do you want me to start looking? 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I don’t know?  
---
Soon?  
---
I guess?  
---
The stairs are.  
---
Getting hard.  
---
And uh, 
---
I'll need a walker soon?  
---
And a wheel chair will be soon 
---
after that and so.  
---
Yeah.  
---
Soon.   
---
---
## PETER: 
You’re sure you’re not mad.   
---
## LISSETTE:
Cheryl actually really wants to do it.  
---
I think she was actually 
---
disappointed that 
---
I hadn’t asked yet. 
---
## PETER: 
I’m sorry 
---
template: overlap
## PETER:
I’m so. 

## LISSETTE: 
Can you please just  
---
Stop apologizing? 
---
## PETER: 
Sure sorry yeah. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
It’s kind of making it worse.    
---
I wish I was married. 
---
## PETER: 
To who? 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I donno. 
---
Anybody? 
---
I wish I was married because then. 
---
None of this would be an issue.   
---
If I were you, and you’d asked me I.  
---
I probably wouldn’t wanna do it either so.   
---
There you go.
---
I'm a shitty friend too.
---
## PETER:
Well, that's not remotely true.
---
template: overlap
## LISSETTE:
Let's just drop it?

## PETER: 
Of course, yes, drop it. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I actually have.  
---
There, uh
---
I have something else that I need help with 
---
and so if you wanna redeem yourself here's your chance
---
## PETER: 
Anything. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Don’t you wanna know what it is first
---
before you committ with such enthusiasm?
---
## PETER: 
Nope there is nothing you could ask me that I wouldn’t do. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Dude you just bailed on being my caregiver. 
---
## PETER: 
Fuck I know. I’m sorry 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Relax I’m fucking with you.    
---
Kind of.   
---
Okay.
---
So I need you to pause.  
---
Whatever impulse you have about.  
---
What I’m about to say and just  
---
Reserve any judgment and just listen. 
---
## PETER: 
OK... 
---
## LISSETTE: 
So, I have a lot of decisions.  
to make.  
---
About my life.  
---
About how I’m going to 
---
live my life.  
---
And
And 
---
template: overlap
## LISSETTE:
How I am going to die 

## PETER: 
Who says you are going to die? 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I mean I am definitely going to die 
---
## PETER: 
But what about Stephen Hawking? 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Oh my god please please don’t. 
---
template: overlap
## LISSETTE:
Bring up Stephen Hawking to me right now! 

## PETER: 
But he lived for a really long time   
---
## LISSETTE: 
That’s like telling a kid 
---
who really wants a.  
---
A pony that they should hold out 
---
template: overlap
## LISSETTE:
for a Freaking unicorn.   

## PETER: 
It is nothing like that.   
---
## LISSETTE: 
It is one hundred percent exactly like that.   
---
## PETER: 
You can’t just assume that 
you’re going to die just because. 
---
## LISSETTE:
You know, I can assume anything I want to assume 
---
template: overlap
## LISSETTE:
because it's my body 

## PETER:
I didn't mean it like that.
---
## LISSETTE:
You agreed to listen. 
---
## PETER: 
Fine.   
---
Listening.
---
## LISSETTE:
I need to make decisions soon. 
---
Because everything is.  
---
My body is changing quickly and I.  
---
There are a lot of unknowns and I.  
---
I need to. I need a plan.  
---
So. I want to.    
---
When it’s time to go.  
---
I want to do it on my own terms. 
---
And so I need.   
---
## PETER: 
Yeah I’m not talking about this right now. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Oh so apparently you didn't really mean it
---
## LISSETTE: 
when you said I could ask you anything  
---
## PETER: 
Not this. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Please don’t make me yell.  
---
It's too hard.   
---
## LISSETTE: 
It’s just getting hard to.  
---
Make words and raise my voice. 
---
The muscles in my throat aren't    
working so well and I.  
---
Just please don’t make me yell.  
---
I can do it legally in Vermont.  
---
I just need to estabilsh residency
---
## PETER: 
Do what?
---
## LISSETTE: 
Peter...
---
## PETER: 
Yeah, I’m not having this conversation 
---
unless you say the actual fucking words. 
---
## LISSETE:
You were the one who said five seconds ago 
---
that you didn't want to have this conversation.
---
## PETER:
It's nothing like that.
---
## LISSETTE:
It's a different context
---
## PETER:
It's a totally different context.
---
## LISSETTE:
How?
---
## PETER:
It just IS.
---
## LISSETTE:
Fine.
Die.  
---
OK?  
---
I can die.  
---
On my own terms.  
---
In Vermont.   
---
## LISSETTE: 
I don’t want feeding tubes.  
---
I don’t want machines.  
---
I don't want to suffocate.  
---
To death.  
---
I want.  
---
To do this.  
---
I am going.  
---
To do this.  
---
And you can either help me.  
---
Or you can not help me and I will.  
---
Figure out a way to do it.  
---
On my own.  
---
I don't want to just wait around to die.
---
I'm really not sad about it.
---
I’m not scared.
---
This is actually the most empowered 
---
I felt since I found all this out
---
So.   
---
## PETER: 
So what do you need from me?
---
Because it sounds like you've got it all figured out.
---
## LISSETTE: 
I wanna have a party. 
---
## PETER: 
A party?
---
## LISSETTE: 
Yes. 
---
## PETER: 
A what the fuck a death party? 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Totally. 
---
## PETER: 
Like we all take a road trip 
---
up to Vermont 
---
and eat chips and guac 
---
and play a couple rounds of 
---
Cards Against Humanity 
---
and get wasted and make smores 
---
and then you off yourself 
---
at the end and we all go home? 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Yeah, something like that. 
---
## PETER: 
That’s the most morbid thing
---
that I’ve ever heard. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I know, I know. 
---
## PETER: 
But also kind of fucking beautiful. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I know it’s weird 
---
## PETER: 
It’s not any weirder 
---
than anything else. 
---
In this.  
---
Weird fucking world.  
---
So.  
---
Okay.  I will help you.
---
OK?   
---
## LISSETTE: 
OK.  
---
## PETER: 
I will help you throw.  
---
The most fabulous fucking 
---
kick ass death party 
---
that has ever existed 
---
in the entire history 
---
of the world.    
---
template: music
---
## LISSETTE: 
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. 
---
Is.  
---
A progressive neurodegenerative disease 
---
that affects nerve cells 
---
in the brain and the spinal cord.  
---
It comes from Greek.  
---
Everything comes from Greek. 
---
Or Latin?  
---
Maybe it’s Latin...
---
Anyway! 
---
“A” means no. 
---
“Myo” is Muscle.  
---
“Trophic” means nourishment.  
---
No muscle nourishment.   
---
So.  
---
Starving muscles.   
---
Muscles dying because 
---
nobody is feeding them.  
---
Or they have stopped eating.  
---
They are on a hunger strike 
---
your muscles.  
---
And so everything that’s holding 
---
you together starts to come undone.  
---
And that’s it.
---
You just start unraveling like a 
---
ball of yarn 
---
and there is nothing to stop it.  
---
There’s no chemo 
---
there’s no surgery 
---
there’s no medicine 
---
there’s no fix 
---
there’s no maybe to hold on to.  
---
No.  
---
You’re gonna die 
---
that’s it end of story.  
---
Because everything is muscles 
---
your head 
---
your heart 
---
your legs 
---
your arms 
---
your stomach 
---
your throat.  
---
Your throat is muscles 
---
and so eventually pretty soon 
---
you can’t breathe 
---
and if you can’t breathe 
---
you die.  
---
I mean yes sure 
---
we are all eventually 
---
going to die.  
---
And some of us will 
---
die old and some will 
---
die young and the clock 
---
starts ticking from the second 
---
the sperm meets the egg 
---
and they have a sex party 
---
and they make a person 
---
the second that happens 
---
you are dying.  
---
So yes we all know 
---
those horribly annoying 
---
“I could die tomorrow 
---
I could get run over 
---
by a car tomorrow 
---
so live your best life!”  
---
people.   
---
I hate those people.  
---
Doesn’t everybody hate those people?  
---
Those people suck.  
---
Stop it right now if you 
are one of those people.  
---
Because everybody hates you.  
---
Literally.  
---
Everybody hates you.    
---
Most people didn’t inherit it.  
---
So it’s just a surprise 
---
that shows up out of nowhere.  
---
It isn’t avoidable. 
---
No life hacks or kale 
---
or collagen peptides 
---
or paleo diet 
---
or vegan green smoothies 
---
or or or colonics 
---
or fasting 
---
or Namaste 
---
or Nam-myocho-renge-kyo 
---
or hashtag so blessed 
---
is gonna save you.  
---
It’s living inside 
---
tucked away 
---
hiding till it finally 
---
decides to take over 
---
and one day you.  
---
You can’t button your shirt.  
---
It’s just a random weird thing 
---
you can’t button your shirt.  
---
Your hands don’t know how 
---
to button a shirt anymore.  
---
It’s not arthritis 
---
it’s not pain 
---
it’s just they can’t 
---
actually do the thing 
---
they’ve always done.  
---
But you’re 38 years old 
---
so that’s weird because 
---
you’ve been buttoning 
---
your whole life 
---
but you can’t make it work.  
---
And you shrug it off 
---
and you try not to fixate on it 
---
but you start bringing it up 
---
to people. 
---
“Is that weird?  
---
Has that happened to you?”  
---
And everybody tells you 
---
“You’re young!  
---
You’re healthy!” 
---
The same people 
---
who undoubtedly say 
---
“Live your best life 
---
because we could all 
---
get hit by a car tomorrow!”  
---
But something is nagging 
---
at you that a healthy 
---
person should be able to 
---
button a shirt.  
---
And then you trip. 
---
Like you start tripping a lot.
---
Like your feet 
---
can’t take care of you anymore.  
---
You feel like you’re walking 
---
on marshmallows.  
---
And you feel flutters 
---
all the time.  
---
Like.  
---
Butterflies.  
---
Butterflies flapping their little 
---
wings all around your insides 
---
and so you google 
---
and you see “the thing” 
---
and you avoid “the thing” 
---
and you look for “a thing” 
---
that’s not “the thing” 
---
and you find magnesium.  
---
Potassium. 
---
Supplement magnesium and potassium 
---
and you do it 
---
and maybe it’s better 
---
you think it’s better 
---
it’s not really better. 
---
Or maybe it’s cancer.   
---
## LISSETTE:  
Cancer actually would be better 
---
than “the thing”. 
---
At this point 
---
you would happily take cancer.  
---
Gladly.  
---
But. 
---
You. 
---
You still can’t button your shirt. 
---
So...
---
You go to the doctor 
---
because you have health insurance 
---
I mean it’s shitty health insurance 
---
but it’s something and so you should go 
---
and the doctor does tests and the doctor calls 
---
and the doctor has you come in 
---
and the doctor can’t do anything 
---
but take a deep breath and tell you the facts. 
---
The facts are that the hand that can’t button 
---
the shirt will become 
---
the foot that can’t carry you 
---
where you want to go 
---
will become the throat 
---
that can’t swallow will 
---
become the head that can’t 
---
hold itself upright 
---
will become the voice 
---
that can’t scream 
---
will lead to feeding tubes 
---
to silence 
---
to air masks 
---
to recording your laugh 
---
so that you can still maybe laugh 
---
because what is a world where you 
---
can’t laugh 
---
can’t hug 
---
can’t eat 
---
can’t scratch an itch 
---
can’t fuck 
---
can’t run 
---
can’t, can’t, can’t. 
---
That all of this leads to death.  
---
Death by suffocation.  
---
Your body will suffocate 
itself.  
---
Awesome right? 
---
I have always hated running.  
---
I have hated running 
---
since I was a kid 
---
and they made me run the mile 
---
and they timed me 
---
and me and Jen Hillman 
---
used to walk the whole way 
---
and talk about boys 
---
and piss off the gym teacher.  
---
The gym teacher 
---
Dick Shohet 
---
who was very well named 
---
because he showed lots of girls 
his dick. 
---
But I wish I could run. 
---
I have dreams that I'm running.  
---
I dream that I’m screaming.  
---
I dream that I’m running 
---
and screaming.  
---
And kicking 
---
and punching 
---
and running 
---
and kicking 
---
and screaming 
---
and punching. 
---
And running. 
---
So yeah.  
---
Somewhere between the buttons 
not buttoning 
---
and the wheelchair 
---
and the suffocating to death 
---
looming in the air you decide.  
---
I decide.  
---
I decided. 
---
I said in my head I said. 
---
My terms.  
---
I said.  
---
No way am I going out like 
this. 
---
No way am I eating through tubes. 
---
And I said in my head.  
---
I said Lissette.  
---
Girl.  
---
You gotta do this 
---
while you can still 
---
move your hands 
---
or else they won’t let you.  
---
I said no crying.  
---
I said. 
---
Put on your big girl pants.  
---
I said.  
---
Get yourself an address in Vermont.
---
Get yourself a doctor who will ign off on it
---
Do it all now before you can’t enjoy 
---
a meal or clutch the hand of 
someone you love.  
---
I said make all the decisions 
---
you wanna make while you still can. 
---
Dot all the i's and cross all the t's
---
And get you go backpack
---
So you can set it all in motion the second you need to
---
Because the longer you wait 
---
the harder it will be 
---
to fight for what you want.  
---
Because how do you fight without hands 
---
without a good punch 
---
without kicking and screaming.  
---
So fuck that live your best life bullshit.  
---
I want to get to have the best death.  
---
My death will be.  
---
Fucking.  
---
Epic.

## PETER: 
He’s a vet. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Oh that’s nice! 
---
## PETER: 
Is it? 
---
## CHERYL: 
Oh yeah.  Vets are good people.   
---
## PETER: 
He is.  He’s a good person. 
---
## CHERYL: 
But… 
---
## PETER: 
I’m allergic to animals.   
---
## CHERYL: 
Oh that’s a problem. 
---
## PETER: 
Yeah, But I’m taking shots. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Good! 
---
## PETER: 
Because I really like animals.  
---
I mean I’m definitely a dog lover. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Yeah I don’t trust people 
---
who don’t like dogs. 
---
## PETER: 
Right? 
---
## CHERYL: 
I always say 
---
it’s no big deal 
---
and then eventually those people 
---
turn out to be shits.   
---
## PETER: 
Yeah so I’m taking the shots. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Good good. 
---
## PETER: 
Because I like dogs and I. 
---
Like him. 
---
And so yeah.  
---
I am doing that.   
---
## CHERYL: 
That’s terrific. 
---
## PETER: 
It could be, I.  
---
Don’t want to jinx it 
---
with too many expectations. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Sure I get it but it sounds good. 
---
## PETER: 
Maybe. 
---
## PETER: 
But he’s great he’s. 
---
Really great. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Well that’s terrific. 
---
## PETER: 
Yeah thanks 
---
I like him. 
---
## CHERYL: 
How’d you two meet?
---
## PETER: 
It was very old school.  
---
It was a fix up.  
---
There was no swiping involved. 
---
## CHERYL: 
I can’t with the swiping. 
---
## PETER: 
Yeah this was a.  
---
We were fixed up by  
---
A sort of ex actually. 
---
A mutual ex. 
---
He fixed us up.  
---
Donovan.  
---
Do you know Donovan? 
---
## CHERYL: 
Isn’t he the douchebag? 
---
## PETER: 
Yeah he’s...
---
Not so bad but yes.  
---
That’s him. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Maybe he’s not such a douchebag after all. 
---
## PETER: 
Nah he’s definitely a douchebag.  
---
But you need one douchebag 
in every friend circle 
---
and so he’s our douchebag. 
---
So. 
---
So, he dated the Vet and he dated me 
---
and he decided we would maybe be a good fit 
---
and I guess we are.  
---
Maybe.  
---
That.    
---
The day of our first date he.  
---
He’d had to put his own dog 
down.  
---
Himself.  
---
Can you imagine? 
---
## CHERYL: 
Oh that’s awful. 
---
## PETER: 
Yeah I um.  
---
I had said 
---
look we can cancel 
---
but he didn’t want to.  
---
He said I gotta get out of the house.  
---
And so we.  
---
We just went and had a coffee.  
---
Walked around the park.  
---
And it was nice.    
---
It’s only been a month.  
---
I don't wanna
---
## CHERYL: 
It’s OK to be hopeful. 
---
## PETER: 
Sure. 
---
## CHERYL: 
I’m telling you.  
---
I’ve never met an asshole vet. 
---
What do you think? 
---
Maybe I should get a dog.  
---
## PETER: 
If you want. 
---
## CHERYL: 
The only pet I’ve ever had 
---
was a poodle.  
---
It was my mother's 
---
and then my mother died 
---
and left my sister Annette a house 
---
and left me that fucking poodle.  
---
The house had rotten planks 
---
and the basement flooded.  
---
Cost my sister an arm and a leg.  
---
But that poodle lived till it was 
---
twenty-two years old.  
---
It was kind of an asshole 
---
but I gotta admit.  
---
I loved that.  
---
Fucking dog.    
---

---
Oh it’s nice to see you, hon.   
---
## PETER: 
You too. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Some days are better than others 
---
but this one.  
---
This day is a real shit day. 
---
## PETER: 
Yeah. 
---
## CHERYL: 
But I like you 
---
so it’s nice to see you.  
---
Takes the edge off.  
---
I look forward to seeing you.  
---
I like you more than I like 
---
a lot of people. 
---
One for you one for me.  
---
We both get a wish.  
---
You got one?   
---
## PETER: 
Yeah I think so. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Is it a good one?   
---
## PETER: 
It’s.  
---
Moderate. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Better than nothing.  
---
OK you ready?    
---
It’s almost time.   
---
## PETER: 
I am ready. 
---
template: noise
blowing out candles
---
## CHERYL: 
I used to call her every year 
---
at the second she was born.  
---
Every year.  
---
I’d say 
---
“Happy Birthday to us!”  
---
Until she got pissed 
---
and said 
---
“It’s not your birthday.”  
---
And I had to agree 
---
and so then I just said.  
---
“Happy Birthday to you only.”  
---
She was a preemie.  
---
So tiny.  
---
Only weighed five pounds.  
---
I think it’s because 
---
I smoked like a pack a day 
---
the whole time I was pregnant.  
---
What did I know? 
---
I was sixteen.  
---
I was a mess.    
---
## PETER: 
What about you? 
---
## CHERYL: 
What about me what? 
---
## PETER: 
You dating anybody?    
---
## CHERYL:
What???  
---
## PETER:
You should date. 
---
## CHERYL: 
What the fucking hell 
---
would I want to do that for. 
---
## PETER: 
You’re still young. 
---
## CHERYL: 
I feel geriatric. 
---
## PETER: 
You don’t look it. 
---
## CHERYL: 
I feel it.  
---
My knees are ready to go.  
---
They are done with working for me.
---
They wanna retire.
---
## PETER: 
When was the last date you went on? 
---
## CHERYL: 
Oh jeez louise 
---
a long time ago.  
---
My pipes 
---
sorry TMI alert
---
my pipes are backed up 
---
if you get my drift. 
---
## PETER: 
So…  Maybe you should.  Date. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Date.  
---
Ugh.  
---
What I’m gonna do make a profile on a website?   
---
## PETER: 
Sure. 
---
## CHERYL:
[laughs]
---
## CHERYL: 
My friend Nancy came over once 
---
and I kid you not 
---
we made a pitcher of voldka cranberry 
---
and we made a thingamajiggie for me.   
---
## PETER: 
And?
---
## CHERYL: 
And nothing.  
---
All the men my age 
---
wanted thirty year olds.  
---
Which was depressing.  
---
And so I kept getting half naked 
---
pictures of seventy year olds 
---
in the bathroom. 
---
So.  
---
No sirree bub.  
---
When my mother 
---
may she rest in peace 
---
was in the old folks home.  
---
She always had all these geezers 
---
sniffing around 
---
and she always said.  
---
“Cheryl what I need that for?”  
---
And I get it.  
---
But.    
---
But a dog maybe.  
---
Maybe I’ll get a dog. 
---
---
What’d you say this was again? 
---
## PETER: 
Malbac.  
---
From Argentina. 
---
## CHERYL: 
It’s nice.  
---
It sure beats the house wine 
---
at Mario’s Pizza lemme tell you.  
---
I think maybe I wanna travel.  
---
I never traveled all my life.  
---
Maybe I wanna do that.   
---
## PETER: 
Where would you go? 
---
## CHERYL: 
Not sure.  
---
I’ve never been to Paris. 
---
## PETER: 
Paris is overrated. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Yeah I get that feeling about it. 
---
I think that’s why I’ve never gone. 
---
## PETER: 
Paris is trying too hard.  
---
Go to Greece. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Maybe.  
---
I did that DNA thing 
---
and it told me I’m a little Greek. 
---
So maybe.   
---
## PETER: 
Or Lisbon. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Sure. 
---
## PETER: 
Or maybe you should do like.  
---
An Eat Pray Love, Cheryl.   
---
## CHERYL: 
Oh like that movie with 
---
whatshername 
---
Julia Roberts? 
---
## PETER: 
Yeah like an epic trip 
---
of self discovery.   
---
## CHERYL: 
I’m not sure I need all that.  
---
That sounds like a lot. 
---
Maybe I’ll just go to Nashville. 
---
## PETER: 
Or you could do that too.  
---
## CHERYL: 
I’ve always wanted to go 
---
to Nashville. 
---
## PETER: 
What’s in Nashville?  
---
## CHERYL: 
The Grand Ole Oprey.  
---
I have always wanted to see that.  
---
It’s on my bucket list. 
---
## PETER: 
Oh fuck hey look. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Hey look at what?
---
## PETER: 
Shhhhh...
---
Don’t move.
---
## PETER: 
We have a tiny visitor.  
---
## CHERYL: 
Oh!  
---
Yeah we sure do.    
---
She’s a pretty one. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Is it just me or is she 
---
looking right at us. 
---
## PETER: 
She’s looking right at us. 
---
---
## PETER: 
Maybe you’ll meet a cowboy! 
---
## CHERYL: 
Huh? 
---
## PETER: 
At the Grand Ole Oprey. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Right!  
---
The Oprey.   
---
Maybe.
---  
Or maybe I’ll just do something 
---
That I’ve always wanted to do. 
---
## PETER: 
That’s OK too.  
---
## CHERYL: 
Yeah.
---
[crying]
---
Yeah.   
---
template: music
---
## PETER: 
Are you ready?
---
Let me go grab your dress.
---
Whew, she weighs a ton.  
---
You’re lucky you don’t 
---
have to walk around in this.   
---
## LISSETTE:
[laughs]
---
## PETER:
Or these.  
---
Are ladies meant to walk around in these 
---
or just stand around and look pretty?
---
Well lucky for you no standing, right? 
---
I can’t with Allison 
---
and the crying every five seconds.      
---
Had I known 
---
I wouldn’t have invited her.  
---
She does this though, right?  
---
Makes everything endlessly about her?  
---
It’s Exhausting.  
---
Your mom thinks the crying room 
---
is “a freaking shit show” 
---
and I think maybe agree with her.    
---
Do you need anything?  
---
Are you OK?   
---
Do you want me to send Allison to a hotel?
---
I can send Allison to a hotel.  
---
Ok, is this conversation stressing you out?
---
We will deal with Allison and the 
---
endless narcissism of her 
---
demonstrative crying.    
---
You are a better human 
---
than I will ever be.

with a zipper. 
---
Next time. 
---
## LISSETTE:
[laughs]   
---
## PETER: 
You clean up good, Kid.  
---
If you get to wherever you’re going 
---
looking like that. 
---
Maybe you will finally 
---
achieve your teenage dream 
---
of fucking Kurt Cobain. 
---
Or River Phoenix.    
---
If that happens will you please 
---
find a way to let me know.  
---
Send me a sign.    
---
I think you are uh
---
good to go
---
So I... 
---
I have a letter. 
---
I know it’s against the rules 
---
so I don’t have to read it but.    
---
Is that a thumbs up for me not reading?    
---
It’s a thumbs up for reading.    
---
You want me to read the letter.
---
I'm feeling like the letter sucks 
and maybe 
---
we should cancel the letter reading.     
---
OK.  
---
It’s more like a list.  
---
I wrote you a list.    
---
Okay. I will try to do this quickly
---
so I can get you back 
---
to The People.  
---
I’ve kept you away 
---
too long from The People. 
---
I will try and to do this
---
not awkwardly.  
---
## PETER: 
I know you asked that 
---
there not be any letters.  
---
And I’m.  
---
Sorry for not respecting that wish.    
---
I wrote that at the top.  
---
I know we discussed that just now but I’m.  
---
I am committed to reading 
---
the entire thing 
---
preamble included.    
---
But...
---
I feel like.  
---
That’s bullshit.   
---
People always say that 
---
they don’t want presents 
---
at birthdays.  
---
They say “Just bring yourself!” 
---
and then you don’t bring a present 
---
and you feel like an asshole so.  
---
I’m writing a letter!  
---
Yay!   
---
That's it. That's the preamble.
---
Now I will read The List.
---
Twenty Things I Love 
---
about my friend Lissette Marie Esposito. 
---
One. 
---
Her spot on impression of Cher singing

Turn back time

Two. 
---
Her ridiculously in depth borderline 
---
savant knowledge of all music.

How she calls me on my bullshit 
---
in a way that nobody else does.

Four. 
---
Her passion for cooking.  
---
Four A. 
---
Her chocolate chip cookies 
---
and her lentil soup 
---
and her truffle popcorn.  
---
Five.  
---
Her ability to always be 
---
authentic to who she is.  
---
Six.  
---
Her kick ass honest 
---
and real and so full of love 
---
relationship with her mom.  
---
That. 
---
I’m gonna be honest.  
---
I’ve always been a little jealous of.  
---
Seven.  
---
The way she always used to pick up 
---
pennies off the street 
---
and scream “Luck!  
---
I have all the luck!!  
---
I am the fucking luckiest!” 
---
when she found them.  
---
Like a little kid.  
---
And then how she'd do a little dance.  
---
And read the date.  
---
And then recite a random 
---
fact from that date.  
---
Seven A.  
---
The way she 
---
sometimes gives said penny 
---
and bestows that luck to. 
---
Whoever she’s with at the time.

---
The Bicentenial.

and unapologetically 
---
deep love for 
---
90's Rom Coms

Cool Ranch Doritos
---
and Britney Spears  
---
Ten.  
---
The way she always talks back at movies 
---
as if the movie can hear her.  
---
Evelen.  
---
How she can make a stranger 
---
feel like an old friend.  
---
Twelve.  
---
Her laugh.  
---
---
OK! 
---
Where were we...
---
Twelve A. 
---
The way her nose crinkles 
---
during said laugh.  
---
Thirteen.  
---
Her insanely impressive vocabulary.  
---
Fourteen.  
---
Her clarity and 
---
confidence about what she wants. 
---
And her stubborn will 
---
to go after it.  
---
Fifteen.  
---
Her aversion to anything sentimental. 
---
Sorry I didn’t realize 
---
this was such a long list.  
---
We are almost at the end I promise.  
---
Sixteen. 
---
Her kindness and patience 
---
towards people who don’t always 
deserve it.  
---
Seventeen. 
---
The way her Boston accent comes out 
---
when she’s drunk. 
---
Eighteen. 
---
Her annual Friendsgiving 
---
the week after the one we all had to do 
---
with our insane families.
---
Nineteen.

I love that she’s my friend.

And I’m going to miss her.  
---
You.  
---
I’m going to miss you.  
---
I’m going to miss you.  
---
A lot.  
---
And.    
---
I’ll... See you when I see you.    
---
That’s it that’s the end.
