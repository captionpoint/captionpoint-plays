The Luckiest 

By Melissa Ross 
---
## PETER: 
So everybody is confirmed for tomorrow 
---
all 40 of them.  
---
Forty seems like a lot. 
---
Do you really like all of these people?    
---
I don’t think I even like ten 
people.  
---
Maybe fifteen.  
---
But forty.    
---
Allison finally got back to 
me.  
---
I had to nag her which was 
---
annoying but she’s coming. 
---
Why is she always so.  
---
She’s always so.  
---
Weird.  
---
About committing to things right? 
---
What’s that about.    
---
Isn’t she too old to be so.  
---
To be such a fucking commitmentphobe 
---
about everything 
---
about fucking brunch plans.  
---
Like just say yes.  
---
Don’t be an asshole and make 
---
us beg to hang out with you.    
---
Like maybe if she started 
---
responding to emails 
---
she could find love and happiness.  
---
She’s turning into one of those 
---
crabby old ladies.   
---
She is you know she is 
---
she needs to nip that shit 
---
in the bud right now.   
---
But she’s coming!  
---
Yay!    
---
Everybody is coming.    
---
I said 10am.  
---
Is that too early?    
---
I figure we can just hang out today right?  
---
You and me.  
---
Relax.  
---
Just us.  
---
And then tomorrow the masses can all descend.    
---
OK good good. 
---
This house is great, right? 
---
I was a little…  
---
Unsure?  
---
About a random Air BnB in Vermont?  
---
AirBnB creeps me out a bit.  
---
But the pictures were pretty 
spot on.    
---
Did you see there’s a pool out back?    
---
Maybe we’ll sit by the pool. 
---
Later.    
---
If you feel up to it. 
---
No rules.  
---
For today no rules.  
---
Tomorrow there are rules. 
---
For everybody else. 
---
But no rules for us.  
---
So!  I uh…    
---
I have like 
---
I have 
---
I went to Trader Joe’s 
---
and I got the.  
---
That cheese with the whatsitcalled the.    
---
Cheddar with the. 
---
The truffles.  
---
Cheddar with truffles.  
---
That was the right one, right?  
---
And I got the.  
---
You wanted the.    
---
Mediterranean hummus, right?    
---
OK good.  
---
There were many hummus-es. 
---
Is that the plural of hummus?   
---
Or is it.  
---
Hummus-i?  Is that it.  
---
There were so many hummus-i?  
---
You say hummus-es.  
---
I say hummus-i.  
---
Sorry I’m making the joke 
---
go on too long aren’t I.  
---
It wasn’t that funny of  a joke.    
---
Oh really?  
---
You don’t like my joke Lissette?  
---
Fuck you.    
---
But good I got the right one 
---
the right hummus good.    
---
Good.  
---
That’s good.    
---
I got like.  
---
So many chips.  
---
I’m sorry.  
---
I was kind of overwhelmed 
---
by the chip aisle.  
---
Trader Joe’s has so many chips, right?    
---
Sririacha chips.  
---
Pickle chips.  
---
Copious amounts of tortilla chips.  
---
So I just started buying all of them.  
---
I bought way too many 
chips. 
---
I was out of control.  
---
I’m sorry.  
---
They just all sounded good 
---
and I couldn’t decide and I.      
---
There are never too many chips though right?  
---
People like chips?    
---
OK OK OK OK so we have chips.  
---
We will never want. 
---
For chips.    
---
I ordered the cake 
---
from that place you love 
---
that makes the gluten free cakes 
---
that don’t taste like shit. 
---
Chocolate with chocolate ganache.    
---
They said jam or no jam.  
---
And I said no jam.    
---
I just kept hearing your voice 
---
in my head saying.  
---
Why would anybody fuck up 
---
a ganache with jam.    
---
Is that something you have 
---
actually said to me?  
---
Or did you send me a psychic message.   
---
OK I’m not crazy you have said this.    
---
Do you hate me that I don’t 
---
remember us having that conversation?   
---
So long as there is no jam 
---
fucking up your ganache.    
---
OK there won’t be.  
---
So…  We’re good.    
---
Oh! So I was thinking.  
---
Keep an open mind about this 
---
or try to keep an open mind.    
---
Stop judging before you hear 
it.    
---
OK so I was thinking I know 
---
we didn’t go over this 
---
I know I’m going a little rogue 
---
with this idea but.  
---
What do you think about a.  
---
A signature cocktail!   
---
Oh come on!    
---
What’s wrong with a signature cocktail???  
---
Oh so you are the only person 
---
allowed to make a signature 
cocktail?  
---
Is that it?    
---
I promise it won’t be twee.  
---
I would never make anything 
---
twee for you for this I just. 
---
Something with...Campari?    
---
Oh…  See that.  
---
See what happens when you hear 
---
someone out before making a decision.  
---
When you remain open to possibility.  
---
See.
---
Maybe don’t try to control everything.  
---
Maybe trust people to not be idiots
---
and maybe come up with ideas that 
---
you maybe don’t hate maybe.    
---
Maybe a little gin.  
---
Some triple sec.  
---
Limoncello.
---
I knew it. 
---
I knew you would love this.  
---
I knew it. 
---
I know you better than 
---
you know yourself, Lissette. 
---
Never forget that.   
---
I know you a tiny little bit 
---
more than you know yourself. 
---
Fine.
---
Equally.  
---
How’s that?  
---
I know you equally.  
---
Better?   
---
So are we moving forward?  
---
With the Campari?    
---
I’m thinking I’m gonna name it 
---
the Fuck You.  
---
Do you like that?
---
Should it be more specific?  
---
Like fuck you to something specific.  
---
Or is it just a general fuck you.     
---
Just a general fuck you. 
---
Like fuck you to everything.    
---
You love it?   
---
OK good.  
---
The fuck you.  M’Lady.  
---
You now have a signature cocktail.  
---
And I’ll make prissy Allison 
---
ask for it by name.  
---
I won’t give it to her till she says.  
---
Yeah I’d like another Fuck You.  
---
Oh… So your mom…  
---
She insisted on making lasagna.  
---
Just let her make lasagna.  
---
She wants to make lasagna.
---
She needed a job. 
---
This is her job.    
---
I am making.  
---
Thanksgiving.  
---
Roasted turkey.
---
Stuffing.  
---
Mashed potatoes. 
---
Deviled eggs.    
---
So let your mom make lasagna.  
---
At seven pm we will play.  
---
It’s The End of The World As We 
Know It.    
---
You like that? 
---
Yeah I like it too I. 
---
I donno.  
---
I... I thought that was maybe a little funny?
---
And also sad. 
---
It’s a little.  Sad.    
---
It’s the end of the world as we 
know it. 
---
And I feel fine…   
---
And I…  
---
I made a.  
---
Here’s the list of the rules 
---
so that nobody forgets.  
---
Is that weird? 
---
I thought it would be good 
---
to remind them that they.  
---
OK.    
---
One, No crying in front of Lissette.  
---
Pause sidenote.  
---
I... I thought we could make 
---
like a designated 
---
“Crying Room” where people can go?  
---
Is that weird? 
---
It may be a little weird...
---
We’ll try it maybe?
---
OK good.  
---
Two, No reading letters to Lissette.  
---
Three, Tell lots of jokes.  
---
Four, Remember nice memories to share.
---
Five, Lissette may cry.  
---
Don’t get weird if Lissette cries.  
---
Peter may cry.
---
Peter may cry but.  
---
He promises to not do it in front of Lissette.   
---
I promise I won’t cry.  
---
In front of you.  
---
I also may have a letter. 
---
Really?  
---
You don’t want to hear my letter?  
---
Oh yeah?  
---
Well I may force you to sit 
---
and listen to me read your 
letter.  
---
I may hold you down and aggressively 
---
read you my fucking letter.  
---
Yes yes yes.  
---
Sorry sorry sorry.    
---
Hey so I love you?  
---
But... 
---
This position is.  
---
It’s super awkward.  
---
Sorry I just that was.  
---
Sorry.  
---
Thank you?  For what.   
---
I mean I.  
---
All I did was go to Trader Joe’s.  
---
But sure OK.  
---
You’re welcome.    
---
That is so twee.  
---
Did you really just do that?
---
Yeah.  
---
Yeah me too. 
---
---
## PETER: 
Even if you’re in a coma 
---
an indefinite coma 
---
for an indefinite time. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Why am I on Falcon Crest 
---
and why is it 1986? 
---
## PETER: 
This was your theoretical!
---
I’m just. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
OK fine fine fine.  
---
I would still want to live even then. 
---
## PETER: 
That’s a big fat lie. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
It’s not! 
---
## PETER: 
Really??? 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Yes yes really. 
---
## PETER: 
Even if you can’t engage 
---
with anyone or anything 
---
and you’re eating through tubes 
---
and you can’t have sex or even. 
---
Like you can’t ever leave the bed 
---
or the hospital you are in 
---
a vegetative state and you.   
---
## LISSETTE: 
Yes even then! 
---
## PETER: 
Liar.   
---
## LISSETTE: 
Fuck you!  
---
I’m not lying I’m being very sincere.  
---
Also if I am indeed on Falcon 
Crest 
---
I will probably magically come 
---
to life in a few seasons and so.   
---
## PETER: 
Nobody would choose that.  
---
We would all choose pulling the plug.  
---
If you’re brain dead and you’re. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Hold up you didn’t say brain dead you said. 
---
## PETER: 
Yes I did. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
You said coma. 
---
## PETER: 
It’s the exact same thing. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Nope two different things.  
---
Two completely different things. 
---
## PETER: 
Medically they are the same things! 
---
## LISSETTE: 
We have no idea what happens 
---
when people are in comas.
---
People in comas could have very 
---
rich very full inner lives they could. 
---
## PETER: 
Yeah I don’t think that’s what we’re. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
For all we know it’s better than life.  
---
It could be wonderful! 
---
## PETER: 
Being in a coma. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
It could be!  
---
We actually have no idea!   
---
## PETER: 
You would force all of your 
---
loved ones to stay in a constant state 
---
of terror and fear and sadness.  
---
Watching and waiting and worrying that you’re. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
So wait.  
---
Are you saying that life. 
---
My actual life.  
---
Or whatever my theoretical life where I am. 
---
## PETER: 
On Falcon Crest. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Yes right 
---
so you are saying that my life.  
---
My life on season three of Falcon Crest 
---
where I am hooked up to machines. 
---
Whether or not I choose to do that.  
---
That decision.  
---
Should be about other people’s feelings? 
---
Is that it? 
---
## PETER: 
I didn’t say that. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Are you also anti choice? 
---
## PETER:
Wait what???? 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I mean if you think. 
---
## PETER: 
What is happening?  
---
How did we get here? 
---
## LISSETTE: 
If you think that other people 
---
should make decisions about my life 
---
and my body why not go all the way 
---
why not. 
---
## PETER: 
What I am arguing for is 
---
the opposite of anti choice!!!
---
You! 
---
You are actually onthe same side 
---
as the anti choice people! 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I am not! 
---
## PETER: 
You absolutely are! 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Really what this is.  
---
Is that we’re just scared of the unknown 
---
and so we would.  
---
You would.  
---
Because I already said that I wouldn’t.  
---
But you would choose death over 
---
the unknown and that’s. 
---
## PETER: 
That’s not actually what I said I was just. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I mean that’s actually exactly what you. 
---
## PETER: 
THIS IS TOO INTENSE A CONVERSATION 
---
TO HAVE WITH A STRANGER! 
---
## PETER: 
Sorry I was just. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I’m not a stranger.  
---
We’ve been talking for hours and hours.   
---
## PETER: 
One hour.  
---
We have been talking for exactly one hour. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Well it feels like many hours. 
---
## PETER: 
Is that a criticism?  
---
Are you not enjoying the conversation? 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I am very much enjoying our conversation!  
---
I am simply saying it feels like. 
---
## PETER: 
Like you’ve been trapped with me 
---
for multiple hours talking about comas?
---
How did we even get on this topic? 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I actually don’t remember.   
---
## PETER: 
I think it was wasn’t it wait.  
---
Wasn’t there somebody wasn’t somebody 
---
wasn’t it that woman 
---
the one who kept crying 
---
wasn’t she talking about 
---
oh wait didn’t she 
---
just fuck didn’t she put her 
---
cat to sleep was that it.   
---
## LISSETTE: 
Oh... Yeah I think that was it. 
---
## PETER: 
Oh that’s so sad. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
It’s really sad. 
---
## PETER: 
I mean not a big cat person but still. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Yeah no me neither. 
---
## PETER: 
They’re so aloof. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Totally.  
---
I don’t want my pet to be aloof. 
---
## PETER: 
But still it’s still. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
It’s so sad.   
---
## PETER: 
Well...
---
That killed the conversation didn’t it. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
No pun intended… 
---
## PETER: 
Oh pun definitely intended. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Oh no!  
---
How do we get it back? 
---
## PETER: 
I think we stop talking about death. 
---
## LISETTE:
But we were talking about death 
---
before and it was going so well! 
---
## PETER: 
I know but that was theoretical 
---
make believe death.   
---
## LISSETTE: 
Actually it was a coma.  
---
I was in a coma on a soap opera in the 80’s. 
---
## PETER: 
Right it wasn’t actual death.   
---
## LISSETTE: 
Coma.   
---
## PETER: 
Sure.  Coma.  
---
Brain... Death.   
---
## PETER: 
Maybe we should talk about the 
things 
---
you know the things you talk about at parties like...    
---
How do you know Allison? 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I know Allison because Allison 
---
was my roommate in college. 
---
## PETER: 
Ah...  Interesting. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
How do you know Allison?
---
## PETER: 
I actually don’t know Allison.  
---
I crashed the party I don’t know anybody here.   
---
## LISSETTE: 
Oh my God really? 
---
## PETER: 
No I came with Donovan. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Oh!  Donovan...
---
## PETER: 
Do you dislike Donovan? 
---
## LISETTE:
No!   
---
Not at all!   
---
But... You were far more 
interesting 
---
when you were the guy who crashed the party.  
---
Now you’re just like whatever you’re.  
---
Donovan’s plus one.    
---
Yay Donovan!  
---
Our friend! 
---
Yay! 
---
## PETER: 
Pause… 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Wait are you actually on a date with Donovan? 
---
## PETER: 
Oh I mean.  
---
## LISSETTE: 
Oh shit are you the guy he keeps talking about??? 
---
## PETER: 
Who is the guy he keeps talking about? 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Are you the Vet? 
---
## PETER: 
I am not...The Vet. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Oh fuck sorry. 
---
## PETER: 
I am the real estate agent. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Oh... Right.    
---
Donavan is a douche.  
---
You can definitely do better than.  
---
Donovan.  
---
Like we call him sometimes 
---
we call him Douchebag Donavan.  
---
To his face.  Ask him.  
---
And we are his friends.  
---
So. Trust me.   
---
You are way too good for Donovan.  
---
Like even his name, right?  
---
You name someone Donovan you are 
---
setting them up to be an asshole. 
---
## PETER: 
It’s not exclusive or anything. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Sure sure. 
---
## PETER: 
It’s super casual it’s.   
---
I mean it’s.  
---
I don’t know what it is but it’s.   
---
## PETER: 
Oh hey! 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Huh. 
---
## PETER: 
What about what about what about.  
---
Alzheimer’s! 
---
## LISSETTE: 
What about Alzheimer’s. 
---
## PETER: 
Lets say you had Alzheimer’s.  
---
You’re physically fine.  
---
Your mind is gone but you can still 
---
see great art.  
---
Eat great food.  
---
Have moments of joy.  
---
Real true joy.  
---
But you no longer remember 
---
people you used to love.  
---
You have no idea who they are.  
---
What about then.  
---
Would you then. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Would I what then. 
---
## PETER: 
Would you want to live 
---
or would you want to die. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Oh I um.  
---
I don’t know actually I...  
---
I mean I. 
---
My grandmother actually has 
---
Alzheimer’s and so. 
---
## PETER: 
Oh fuck sorry! 
---
## LISSETTE: 
No it’s OK it’s really OK 
---
you didn’t know I just.  
---
It’s sad sometimes to think 
about it 
---
to think about her and I. 
---
## PETER: 
I was just trying to bring us back 
---
to assisted suicide 
---
and I took a weird morbid turn.   
---
## LISSETTE: 
It’s OK it’s really OK 
---
I... Sometimes I... Like.  
---
Morbid?  
---
Conversations?  
---
I...
---
Sorry is that a weird thing to say out loud?  
---
Sometimes I say things out loud 
---
and literally as I’m saying it 
---
I’m like why are you saying that 
---
weird thing you’re saying. 
---
## PETER: 
I like morbid conversations. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I like true crime shit.   
---
## PETER: 
I binge watch SVU all the time.  
---
And Investigation Discovery Channel 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Investigation Discovery Channel!  
---
Yes.  Me too.   Um.    
---
But um my.  
---
Sometimes my grandmother has.  
---
She’ll have these.  
---
Moments of lucidity and she will say that.  
---
She wants to die and...    
---
And I wish I could give her that?  
---
So...  So maybe.  
---
Maybe if I was the way that she is maybe I would.  
---
Also.  Want to die.    
---
Maybe. I don’t know. I.  
---
I mean I.    
---
Did you try the onion dip? 
---
## PETER: 
Fuck do I love onion dip.  
---
There’s onion dip???? 
---
## LISSETTE: 
There is!  
---
And it’s like old school 
---
lipton onion soup mix sour cream onion dip.  
---
## PETER: 
The best. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
With ruffles. 
---
## PETER: 
Amazing.  That’s amazing.  
---
I love ruffles. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Me too. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I’m Lissette. 
---
## PETER: 
Oh!    
---
Right.  
---
Lissette.  Hi. 
---

---
## PETER: 
I’m not organizing it I’m just. 
---
## CHERYL: 
You’re the host for this thing.   
---
## PETER: 
There is no host.  
---
I’m not a host.   
---
## CHERYL: 
You’re definitely the host 
---
of whatever this is.   
---
What is this?  
---
Is this a party? 
---
## PETER: 
Yes it’s a party. 
---
## CHERYL:

---
These are just beginning steps 
---
and I. 
---
## CHERYL: 
So you’re the host.   
---
## PETER: 
I’m not the host 
---
there isn’t going to be an official host. 
---
## CHERYL: 
What are you then you’re the planner? 
---
## PETER: 
Planner is different than host. 
---
## CHERYL: 
I donno.  
---
You seem to be the one in charge 
---
and so I’m gonna say you’re the 
host.   
---
## PETER: 
I’m just executing.  
---
I’m not delegating I’m executing. 
---
## CHERYL: 
[Laughs] 
---
So does that make you the executioner?   
---
## PETER: 
Cheryl come on.   
---
## CHERYL: 
Oh for fuck’s sake Petey 
---
you gotta laugh at that one.   
---
## PETER: 
It’s not really. 
---
## CHERYL: 
This whole conversation 
---
is so freaking morbid 
---
you gotta at least have 
---
a laugh with me on that.  
---
Executioner?   
---
Come on that’s funny.  
---
You gotta give me that 
---
it’s funny.   
---
## PETER: 
It’s a little funny. 
---
## CHERYL: 
So why aren’t you laughing?  
---
Oh for fuck’s sake you are a pip, Petey.  
---
You’re a real pip.  
---
OK I get it no laughing.  
---
I will be very serious from now on.    
---
So are you gonna give me a job or what? 
---
## PETER: 
Would you like a job? 
---
## CHERYL: 
I’m the mother of course I want a job! 
---
## PETER: 
OK Cheryl what job would you like to have. 
---
## CHERYL: 
I want a title.  
---
If this were a wedding I would have a title. 
---
## PETER: 
What about Lissette’s Mom 
---
that good? 
---
## CHERYL: 
That’s a shitty title. 
---
## PETER: 
OK well I’ll think of something. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Make it good. 
---
## PETER: 
I will.  
---
Try my best. 
---
## CHERYL: 
I don’t want a lousy title for this.  
---
This is.    
---
It’s an important day.   
---
## PETER: 
I know. 
---
## CHERYL: 
I’m not gonna get a wedding so.  
---
You gotta give me this. 
---
## PETER: 
Why don’t you make something. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Make what?  
---
Like a craft project?  
---
What kind of freaking idiot thing is that? 
---
## PETER: 
No like cooking.  
---
Why don’t you bring a dish? 
---
## CHERYL: 
Oooh I could make a lasagna. 
---
## PETER: 
That works. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Maybe a nice salad and some garlic bread?
---
## PETER: 
Whatever you want.  
---
You can make.  
---
Whatever you want. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Yeah OK.  
---
I’ll do that.    
---
I’ll do that.   
---
## CHERYL: 
How many? 
---
## PETER: 
How many what?
---
## CHERYL: 
How many lasagnas?
---
## PETER: 
Oh!  Um...  
---
I mean as many as you wanna make.   
---
## CHERYL: 
Maybe I’ll make two.  
---
One with sausages and one without sausages. 
---
## PETER: 
Sounds like a plan. 
---
## CHERYL: 
I gotta make a list.  
---
You got a pen I wanna jot myself a note. 
---
## PETER: 
I mean this is all in the 
---
unforeseeable future.  
---
We don’t have a date. 
---
We’re just.    
---
## CHERYL: 
Petey. 
---
## PETER: 
Huh? 
---
## CHERYL: 
What’s this we business.   
---
## PETER: 
I am working with Lissette to plan the party. 
---
## CHERYL: 
I knew it!  
---
You are the host!  
---
Just admit it you’re the host. 
---
## PETER: 
For the last time Cheryl.  
---
There is.  
---
No host. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Lissette knows I throw a good party.  
---
She should just let me do it 
---
and make it nice for her. 
---
## PETER: 
You would.  
---
Everybody knows that. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Why are you telling me anyway.  
---
Why isn’t my kid telling me herself. 
---
## PETER: 
I mean I think it’s too weird? 
---
## CHERYL: 
Weird what?
---
## PETER: 
For Lissette.  To...  
---
I mean she hasn’t said 
---
anything to me about it.  
---
But...  
---
I think it’d be weird to talk to your mom about...  
---
The event.  
---
The event of the party I think.  
---
I don’t think she wants to 
---
exclude you I think. 
---
## CHERYL: 
We didn’t always get along 
---
me and her but we worked it out.  
---
I thought we worked it out 
---
and I just. 
---
## PETER: 
Listen to me.  
---
This isn’t 
---
she isn’t trying to hurt you.  
---
OK? 
---
It’s just... 
---
You shouldn’t have to plan this, Cheryl.  
---
Right?  
---
You should get to just.   
---
Show up.    
---
## CHERYL: 
You are a good kid, Petey.   
---
## PETER: 
Thank you Cheryl. 
---
## CHERYL: 
I hope Lissette appreciates
---
everything you do for her.  
---
I know from personal experience 
---
that she sometimes forgets to say 
---
thank you despite being raised 
better.   
---
## PETER: 
I’m not keeping score.   
---
## CHERYL: 
That’s very good. 
---
Scorekeeping in relationships.  
---
All relationships.  
---
Is death. 
---
I useta try to tell my first 
---
ex husband that but believe you me.  
---
That man kept meticulous score.  
---
Couldn’t remember my birthday or 
---
pick up his own freaking drawers 
---
but I swear to God 
---
he could itemize every time 
---
he washed a goddamn dish. 
---
## CHERYL: 
You need to find someone.  
---
You take good care.  
---
But who takes care of you, huh? 
---
## PETER: 
Yeah I mean sure.   
---
## CHERYL: 
Did she tell you that you hadda talk to me or did you volunteer? 
---
## PETER: 
She didn’t tell me she asked if I would do it and I said I would do it. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Why would you ever say yes to that. 
---
## PETER: 
Because.  She’s my best friend and I. 
---
## CHERYL: 
This is terrible task she gave. 
---
## PETER: 
And because I.  Really care about you.   
---
## CHERYL: 
I always wanted a son.  Son’s take care of their mothers.  Do you take 
care of your mother? 
---
## PETER: 
My mother’s dead. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Mine too.    Was your’s an asshole?  Mine was kind of an asshole. 
---
## PETER: 
My mother? 
---
## CHERYL: 
Yeah. 

---
## PETER: 
She was complicated.   
---
## CHERYL: 
Mine told me I was going to hell at least five times a year and I still made sure 
they changed her diapers in the home so.  What else are you gonna do, right? 


Pause. 
She takes a pack of Life Savers out of her purse.   
She takes a few out till she gets pineapple.   

She holds the candy out to Peter.   

---
## CHERYL: 
You want?  I only like pineapple. 
---
## PETER: 
You gotta cherry one? 
---
## CHERYL: 
When I was a kid I useta pick out all the pineapples 
and throw the rest in the garbage.  Drove my asshole mother nuts. (A little 
laugh.)  Who do you think came up with that huh?  Lime, lemon I get.  But 
pineapple.  Crazy.    What kinda candy did you 
like when you were a kid, Petey.   
---
## PETER: 
Big League Chew. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Isn’t that gum? 
---
## PETER: 
Yeah. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Gum’s not candy what was your favorite candy. 
---
## PETER: 
I think I liked plain old Hershey Bars. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Yeah those were the same when I was a kid too.  You’re an old soul. 
I’ve been told. 
---
## PETER: 
Pause… 
---
## CHERYL: 
I wanna pull the plug.   
---
## PETER: 
There isn’t gonna be a plug. 


---
## CHERYL: 
I’m the mother I should get to pull the plug.  That’s a place of honor.  I want 
that title. Plug puller. 
---
## PETER: 
There isn’t going to be a literal plug.  I think it’s a drink. It’s a.   
---
## CHERYL: 
So I can make the drink. 
---
## PETER: 
There’s a nurse!  There will be a nurse there who will monitor all of it 
---
## CHERYL: 
I need a job!    And you need to give it to me because you’re 
the event planner you’re the organizer the host the whatever you are so you tell 
me what my job is, Petey! You gotta give me a job any job to do an important 
job I need you need to give me something anything because I. 
Listen to me.  Cheryl.

---
## PETER: 

You are gonna make the 
---
## CHERYL: 
Oh fuck you with the lasagna. 
---
## PETER: 
No fuck you.  That’s an important job.  You want a job.  That’s your job.  You’re 
making the lasagna. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Now you’re making fun. 
---
## PETER: 
You are gonna make the most delicious lasagna that anybody has ever tasted in 
their entire life.  You are gonna make the most delicious lasagna Lissette has 
ever tasted in her entire life.  You are gonna put all your love into that fucking 
Lasagna, Cheryl.  We are gonna bite in to that lasagna and it’s gonna taste like 
childhood.  And we’re all gonna taste that love you have for her.  And she’s 
gonna eat up all that love you have for her and it’s gonna be in her belly.  That’s 
your job.  That’s the most important job and I need you to promise me that you 
are gonna do that for her? OK?  Can you do that?  Can you promise me that 
you’ll do that?   
She nods and holds his hands in hers.   
She holds his hands tight.   
She keeps nodding.  And nodding.  And nodding.  Refusing to cry.   


Peter and Lissette 
---
## LISSETTE: 
OK so I need to tell you something and I need you to not freak out on me when I 
tell it to you. 

---
## PETER: 
What did you do. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Oh my god fuck you! 
---
## PETER: 
No seriously what did you do. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
What makes you think I did something? 
---
## PETER: 
Because I know you.  I know you better than you know you. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
OK that is definitely not true but whatever. 
---
## PETER: 
I know you better than almost anybody knows you. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I mean that’s maybe partially true maybe. 
---
## PETER: 
Definitely true. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
OK but what kind of judgy bullshit is that??? 
---
## PETER: 
I’m not judging! 

---
## LISSETTE: 
What kind of bullshit is that making an assumption that I fucking did 
something.   
---
## PETER: 
Why are you surprised that I would ask that??? 
She gives him a look. 
---
## PETER: 
Don’t give me that look. 


---
## LISSETTE: 
Don’t micromanage my expressions. 
---
## PETER: 
You are making a big deal out of minutia.  You know that right? 

---
## LISSETTE: 
I’m not giving you a look! 
---
## PETER: 
You can’t see your face!  It is a subliminal look! 
---
## LISSETTE: 
That’s not an actual thing. 
---
## PETER: 
Are you denying that you are a person who seems to.  Find drama. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I wouldn’t call it drama I would just. 
---
## PETER: 
Are you forgetting the time I helped you hack into your boss’s email account to 
intercept. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Yes I know I was there! 

---
## PETER: 
To intercept an email where you told him that he and his fucking misogynist 
ass grabbing self could. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Please stop telling me about things that I already know about! 
---
## PETER: 
Or what about the fucking pregnant pig.  Are you forgetting the pregnant pig. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I refuse to engage in this conversation with you. 

---
## PETER: 
We can’t let a pregnant pig be turned into bacon, Peter!  We have to save 
the pregnant pig! 
---
## LISSETTE: 
IT WAS A VERY GOOD THING THAT WE DID THAT. 
---
## PETER: 
I agree but still. 


---
## LISSETTE: 
Petunia is on a farm and living a wonderful life happy as literally a “pig in shit”.  
And got to have her babies surrounded by fucking vegans.  And it’s all 
because of us. 
---
## PETER: 
Dude we stole a fucking pig! 

---
## LISSETTE: 
Sometimes a bad deed is fine if it’s for the greater good. 
---
## PETER: 
What if that pig was supposed to die?  What if it’s some kind of bullshit where 
you go back in time and you change things and then you create a dystopian 
future because of it. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
OK I love you and I see where you’re going with that.  But.  We didn’t fuck up 
the world because we saved Petunia.  God wasn’t like.  You know what?  The 
world needs more bacon and because Peter and Lissette messed shit up I am 
going destroy the world. That didn’t happen. 
---
## PETER: 
OK fine but I’m just saying that it shouldn’t be surprising to you that when you 
say.  “Don’t freak out.”  I respond with.  “What did you do.” 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Fine whatever keep judging.  Judgy McGee.  Just you do you.   
---
## PETER: 
Not judging. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I’m…    Unpredictable. 
---
## PETER: 
Correct. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
And fun.  I am so fun. 

---
## PETER: 
Sometimes. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I am your favorite person. 
---
## PETER: 
Sometimes. 


---
## LISSETTE: 
You’re such an asshole.  Stop being an asshole.   
---
## PETER: 
Will you just please tell me whatever you need to tell me. 

---
## LISSETTE: 
First apologize to me for accusing me of doing something. 
---
## PETER: 
Oh my god why are we. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
It hurt my feelings. 
---
## PETER: 
Sorry. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Why are you sorry. 
---
## PETER: 
I am sorry for… 
---
## LISSETTE: 
For making the assumption. 
---
## PETER: 
For making the assumption. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
That my really fun and awesome friend Lissette who I have known for over a 
decade and. 
---
## PETER: 
That my… 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Say it. 
---
## PETER: 
I’m saying it!  Stop being bossy! 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Say it. 
---
## PETER: 
That my really fun and awesome friend Lissette. 


---
## LISSETTE: 
You have to mean it.  You have to say it with so much sincerity. 
---
## PETER: 
I mean it! 

---
## LISSETTE: 
You don’t sound like you mean it you sound like you’re mocking me. 
---
## PETER: 
That my really fun and awesome friend Lissette. 
for.  Over a decade.   
Who I have known 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Did something bad and that. 
---
## PETER: 
I never implied bad! 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Did something bad. 
---
## PETER: 
Fine.  Did something bad. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
And also. 

---
## PETER: 
And also. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
She is my best friend and favorite person in the entire world.   
---
## PETER: 
You are my best friend and you are one of my favorite people in the entire world. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Fucker. 
---
## PETER: 
If it’s cool with you I would like to leave space for a boyfriend to be my favorite 
person in the entire world.  I would like to have a boyfriend. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I would also like for you to have a boyfriend. 
---
## PETER: 
Yeah. 


---
## LISSETTE: 
Because you are a wonderful and amazing human and you deserve someone as 
wonderful and amazing as you are. 
---
## PETER: 
Yeah yeah. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
No yeah yeah.  Look me in the eye and tell me that you believe down deep in 
your heart that you deserve that. 
---
## PETER: 
Can you just tell me what you need to tell me. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
First you need to look me in the eye.   
---
## PETER: 
This is bananas.  You’re being bananas. 
Look me in the eye goddamnit. 
Now tell me.   
---
## LISSETTE: 

---
## PETER: 
I feel ridiculous. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I don’t care.   
and amazing human and I. 
Just do it.  I am a wonderful 
---
## PETER: 
So fucking bossy. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Say it. 
---
## PETER: 
I am a wonderful and amazing human. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
And I deserve someone as wonderful and amazing as I am. 
---
## PETER: 
And I…    Why am I crying?   
---
## LISSETTE: 
And I deserve someone as wonderful and amazing as I am. 


---
## PETER: 
And I deserve someone as.  Wonderful and.  Amazing.  As.  I am.   
Pause… 
---
## PETER: 
So…  You still haven’t told me what you wanted to tell me. 

---
## LISSETTE: 
Oh right. 
---
## PETER: 
Now I’m bursting at the seams with curiosity. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
You need to promise not to be weird about it.  Do you promise. 
---
## PETER: 
Yes. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Like I need you to not even blink an eye just hear what I’m gonna say like it’s 
totally the most normal thing you’ve ever heard. 
---
## PETER: 
OK… 
---
## LISSETTE: 
It’s nothing it’s not that big a deal or anything. 
---
## PETER: 
Did you win powerball??? 
---
## LISSETTE: 
No. 
---
## PETER: 
Fuck that would have been so awesome if you won powerball. 

---
## LISSETTE: 
Yeah it would…  It really would.  But no.  I did not win.  Powerball.   
Pause… 
---
## PETER: 
Oh my god tell me just fucking tell me! 


---
## LISSETTE: 
OK.    OK.    Um.    So…  I did what you told me to do and 
I went to the doctor to figure out what’s up with my leg and my hands and why 
I keep falling down and she. 
---
## PETER: 
Finally. 

---
## LISSETTE: 
And she sent me to this specialist and so I went to the specialist and they. 
---
## PETER: 
Did you tell me you were doing that? 
---
## LISSETTE: 
No?  I donno I don’t think?  Anyway they did all these tests like lots of 
tests and they. 
---
## PETER: 
Good good. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
And they kept saying that thing they say that doctors say that.  Don’t worry 
they say you’re fine everything’s fine we just need to see this and that and I 
kept freaking out that my shitty insurance wouldn’t cover all of it because my 
deductible is so huge. 
---
## PETER: 
You need to do the tests if the doctors want tests. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I know I know!  I did the tests I was just freaking out because it’s gonna be a lot 
of money that’s all I’m saying.  I took the tests.    I took all the endless 
tests and.    And then I waited for weeks. And I almost forgot about it but 
then last week they were like can you come in?    Um.  They had me 
come in.  It’s never good when they want you to come in.  I tried to get them to 
tell me whatever it was over the phone but they wouldn’t. I was like just tell me 
please can you please just tell me.  But they changed the subject.  They didn’t 
answer.  They just said “OK!  We are transferring you to the receptionist!”  Like 
they didn’t even hear me.  Like I thought in my head I was screaming but 
maybe it was just in my head?  I.    The receptionist couldn’t fit me in for 
a week.  I kept saying I think this is important and she said we’ll put you on a 
cancellation list and I said fine and so all week I had to just wait and it was 
awful waiting and I. 
---
## PETER: 
But you’re fine.   
---
## LISSETTE: 
And so I went back yesterday. 


---
## PETER: 
They wouldn’t have you wait a week if you weren’t fine. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I don’t think they care either way.   

---
## PETER: 
Is it a torn ligament? 
---
## LISSETTE: 
It’s not a torn ligament. 
---
## PETER: 
Did you get an MRI? 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I didn’t get an MRI. 
---
## PETER: 
You need to get an MRI.  Don’t try to save money if you need an MRI you need 
to.   
---
## LISSETTE: 
OH MY GOD PETER I DON’T NEED A FUCKING MRI. 
Pause… 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Sorry.  I didn’t mean to. 
---
## PETER: 
It’s OK. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I.    Um.  And so I.    So…    So yesterday I went back in 
and they sat me down and they tried to act like everything wasn’t a disaster and 
so they were cold.  They were all so cold. 
---
## PETER: 
What’s wrong.   

---
## LISSETTE: 
Please don’t. 
---
## PETER: 
What’s wrong. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
You’re getting worried and I need you right now to not be worried. 


---
## PETER: 
WHAT’S FUCKING WRONG. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Peter I am this close to 100 percent freaking out and so I need you to not freak 
out because I need today I need.  Today I need you to tell me that it’s all gonna 
be OK.  Lie to me if you have to.  But today I need you to act like there’s nothing 
wrong with anything I’m about to tell you.  If I see your face freak out I’m gonna 
full on fall apart.  Because.  There is so much epically wrong with what I’m 
about to tell you OK?  But if you shrug and say it’s fine.  It’s fine it’s a bump in 
the road it’s an obstacle but it’s not as bad as you think it is.  If you do that for 
me.  Today.  I will be OK I won’t fall over the edge.  I’m.    I’m gonna need 
to tell my mom I don’t know how to tell my mom.  And she is going to.  I mean 
it’s.  I just. Before I fucking put on my big girl pants and deal with this. I just 
need one day.  Just one fucking day.   Where I can pretend that none of this is 
actually happening.  And so if I say it out loud and you don’t blink an eye you 
just take it in if you do that for just for today.  It’ll be OK.  I can pretend it’s OK. 
I just need today to pretend today that it’s OK. 
---
## PETER: 
OK. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
And then I need to go drink a lot of alcohol and smoke like a pack of cigarettes.  
I need to drink till I pass out. 
---
## PETER: 
All right.  I can do that.    Margaritas. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Yes please. 
---
## PETER: 
Like those stupid mango frozen margaritas.  Pitchers. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
With salt. 
---
## PETER: 
And guac. 

---
## LISSETTE: 
Yes yes to all of this yes. 
---
## PETER: 
We are going to drink all the margaritas and eat all the guac. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Can I sleep over. 


---
## PETER: 
Yes. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Can I sleep in your bed with you. 

---
## PETER: 
Yes. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I know I kick in my sleep and steal the covers but I. 
---
## PETER: 
You can sleep in my bed with me. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Can I sleep over for.  A very long time. 
---
## PETER: 
Yes. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Thank you. 
---
## PETER: 
Sure. 
Pause… 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Tell me it’s gonna be OK. 
---
## PETER: 
It’s gonna be OK.  It’s all gonna be OK.   
---
## LISSETTE: 
OK. 
---
## PETER: 
OK. 

She takes a deep breath.  A here we go breath.  She grabs his hand.   
OK. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Cheryl and Lissette. 
---
## CHERYL: 
You’ll have to come home with me to Woburn. 


---
## LISSETTE: 
Yeah I will not actually be doing that. 
---
## CHERYL: 
There’s no room for me here. 

---
## LISSETTE: 
Nobody is asking you to uproot your life for this. 
---
## CHERYL: 
What’re you gonna do then huh.  How’re you gonna manage by yourself. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I have friends, Ma.  I have a really good group of friends. 
---
## CHERYL: 
How are you gonna get up five flights of stairs. 
about that? 
Did you think 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Of course I have! 
---
## CHERYL: 
You can barely lift a fork right now how are you gonna. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
OK that’s dramatic.  I can definitely lift a fork.   

---
## CHERYL: 
You gonna teleport yourself?  Up the stairs? 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I haven’t thought that far ahead! 
---
## CHERYL: 
Well you gotta get outta denial sweetheart.  Because I can tell you right now. 
Nobody’s gonna carry you up five flights of stairs.    I love you. I love you 
with every fiber of my being.  But my knees just can’t do it.  So…  We gotta have 
a plan. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Who’s “we’?  This isn’t a “we” situation it’s a “me” situation it’s a. 
---
## CHERYL: 
My condo is on one floor.  You’ll be able to get around easy. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Oh god that’s depressing, Ma. 


---
## CHERYL: 
It’s not!  It’s a very cheery condo! 
---
## LISSETTE: 
But I’d be stuck in Woburn.   

---
## CHERYL: 
There is a lot to do in Woburn, Missy.   What you’re a big shot, 
huh?  You too fancy pants for Woburn. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Yeah.  I am definitely too fancy pants for Woburn, Ma. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Woburn is a lovely place to live. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
It is.  It is a lovely place to live.  For you.    I spent my entire life trying to 
get out of Woburn, Ma.  I definitely don’t want to.  Die.  There.   
Silence. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Don’t be insulted. 
---
## CHERYL: 
I’m not insulted. 

---
## LISSETTE: 
You look insulted… 
---
## CHERYL: 
Nope!  Not at all not one bit.  I am not insulted.   
---
## LISSETTE: 
Yeah OK. 
---
## CHERYL: 
I just think that maybe. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Here we go. 
---
## CHERYL: 
That you judge a little bit.   
---
## LISSETTE: 
OK. 


---
## CHERYL: 
And you need a plan because.   
---
## LISSETTE: 
Peter.   

---
## CHERYL: 
What about Peter. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Peter is gonna come stay with me.  That’s the plan.   
---
## CHERYL: 
What kinda cockamamie plan is that. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
When and if I need somebody to live with me. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Peter???  That is a huge imposition on Peter! 
---
## LISSETTE: 
He offered!  I didn’t ask. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Peter??? 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Stop saying it like it’s weird! It’s not weird! 
---
## CHERYL: 
You two are too intimate for platonic friends.   
---
## LISSETTE: 
I don’t even know what that means. 
---
## CHERYL: 
It means that you two are too close for for for. For non romantic partners. 

---
## LISSETTE: 
So only people with romantic partners get to have help when they get sick?  
Is that it. 
---
## CHERYL: 
I told you that you can. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Single people should just.  Die alone.  Is that what you think. 


---
## CHERYL: 
I didn’t say that! 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Both of us are single right now and so we. 

---
## CHERYL: 
Maybe that’s why. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Maybe what’s why. 
---
## CHERYL: 
You two are single.  Because there isn’t any room for anybody else. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
If I can’t judge Woburn you can’t judge my friendship with Peter! 
---
## CHERYL: 
I’m just saying that maybe if you two put some space in-between there you 
would find someone. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I think the opportunity for that has passed for me and so. 
---
## CHERYL: 
But what about him.    Maybe he wants to find someone. 

---
## LISSETTE: 
I want him to find someone. 
---
## CHERYL: 
How’s he gonna find someone if he’s living here with you and carrying you up 
the fucking stairs! 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Peter finding someone or not finding someone has nothing to do with him 
possibly living here if I need help at some point. 

---
## CHERYL: 
It’s not an if! 
---
## LISSETTE: 
They said it could be slow moving and so you.  
---
## CHERYL: 
Honey. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
You don’t know!  Nobody knows! And so I. 


---
## CHERYL: 
Is Peter gonna give you a bath when you need it? 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Sure. 

---
## CHERYL: 
He gonna wipe your ass? 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Oh my god. 
---
## CHERYL: 
I wiped that ass once I can wipe it again. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Can we stop talking about people wiping my ass please! 
---
## CHERYL: 
You need a plan.  This I know one hundred percent.   
---
## LISSETTE: 
You mean I need to do your plan! 
---
## CHERYL: 
You live in a five flight walk up!  You are you are you are you are whatever 
happens you are not gonna be able to get up five flights of stairs anymore.  Not 
with me not with Peter not with your fairy fucking godmother.  That’s not my 
plan that’s not your plan I don’t want to believe that it’s God’s fucking plan but 
it’s happening so.  I don’t give a rats ass what you want to do but you can’t live 
here anymore.  With Peter bless his heart or without Peter.  With me or without 
me.  This apartment is no longer an option.  OK?  Do you get that??  This isn’t 
about me or what I want it’s about logistics baby girl and and facts. And the 
logistics and facts are that whether this fucker is slow moving or fast moving it 
doesn’t matter.  Because either way the chances of you being able to do five 
flights of stairs in a few months is pretty slim so.    Are you listening to 
me.  
---
## LISSETTE: 
Yes I’m listening.  Of course I’m listening.  I’m always listening.   

---
## CHERYL: 
What’s that supposed to mean. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I donno Ma.  You’re hard not.  To hear.   
---
## CHERYL: 
You mean I’m loud? 


---
## LISSETTE: 
Yeah. 
---
## CHERYL: 
You’re loud too. 

---
## LISSETTE: 
Yeah I.  Know.   Because I always haveta yell.  To get heard.   
---
## CHERYL: 
It’s a good thing. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I guess. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Nah trust me.  It’s good for a woman to be loud.  What you’d rather be a 
milquetoast wallflower like your cousin Jeanine? 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Yeah no I definitely don’t wanna be like Jeanine. 
A little laugh from Lissette.  A little laugh from Cheryl.  Cheryl suddenly and 
without warning starts to cry. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Oh jeez Ma.  Why’re you crying. 

---
## CHERYL: 
Oh it’s nothing it’s nothing. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
OK. 
---
## CHERYL: 
You just suddenly outta nowhere looked at me and you looked you had the 
same face you had when you were a little girl.  It was just a minute and 
suddenly I saw a look you useta get.  Like.  When you were nine months old 
and you.  And you outta nowhere decided you wanted to walk.  Just woke up 
one day and got that look on your face and off you went like.  Like you were 
gonna.  Run the.  Freaking world.     
---
## LISSETTE: 
Sorry. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Why are you apologizing.   


I donno I.  
to Woburn. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I.  I wanna stay in New York.  I don’t wanna go 
---
## CHERYL: 
But if you.   
---
## LISSETTE: 
I’ll move to an apartment with an elevator or on a ground floor whatever I 
haveta do.  But I wanna stay here.  Where my friends are where my life is.  I 
wanna work till I. 
---
## CHERYL: 
At a bar??? How are you gonna work at a bar??? 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Yes in a bar yes Ma yes.   
---
## CHERYL: 
This is a shitty plan. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I don’t care what you think, Ma - this is the plan this is the only plan!! And and 
and fuck and you can figure out a way to be OK with it or you can not do that 
and not see me OK?  But either way I am gonna live my life the way I wanna live 
it till I hit a motherfucking brick wall and can’t anymore and then I’ll.  I don’t 
know what I’ll do I’ll.  Figure that out when I get there I.    Look.  There is 
gonna be a time when I’m not able to move or talk or fight you anymore. And so 
before that happens I need you to hear me – now – saying what I’m saying to 
you.   
---
## CHERYL: 
Yeah yeah.   
---
## LISSETTE: 
Don’t yeah yeah me I need you to promise that you will always.  Whatever I 
decide.  Even if you think it’s batshit crazy.  That you will respect my wishes. 
---
## CHERYL: 
But what if. 

---
## LISSETTE: 
Ma.  I need you to promise me that you will respect my wishes. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Fine yeah I will “respect your wishes.”   
---
## LISSETTE: 
Even if you don’t agree with them. 


---
## CHERYL: 
Yeah sure that too. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Even when I can’t yell at all.  You will still need to.  Find a way to listen.  Do 
you hear me? 
---
## CHERYL: 
Yeah I.  Hear you. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Good.  That’s good.   
Peter and Lissette and Cheryl look at a new apartment. 
Lissette is using a walker. 
Her speech is becoming more difficult.   
Not gone completely.  But harder to get words out. 
---
## PETER: 
And it’s got a backyard!  Did you see the backyard? 
---
## CHERYL: 
Oh that’s nice.  Hon did you see a yard. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Yup. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Maybe we could plant some flowers or something.     
---
## PETER: 
Ground floor.   
---
## CHERYL: 
Yeah we like that don’t we.   

---
## LISSETTE: 
The stoop. 
---
## CHERYL: 
We got up just fine.  
---
## LISSETTE: 
Not now.  Later. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Oh right OK yeah I wasn’t thinking. 


---
## LISSETTE: 
It’s OK. 
---
## PETER: 
OK not this one!  There will be more! 

---
## CHERYL: 
We will find something better.  Right Petey? 
---
## PETER: 
We will find something awesome. 
Pause… 
---
## PETER: 
Sorry I wasn’t thinking about that. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
It’s OK. 
Pause… 
---
## CHERYL: 
If we move to my condo in Woburn. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Ma! 

---
## CHERYL: 
I’m just saying that if we. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
No. 
---
## PETER: 
But maybe that’s the best. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
No.  End of. Conversation. 
Silence. 
---
## PETER: 
OK…  I’m gonna give the keys back to the super and then. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Thank you Petey. 
---
## PETER: 
Be right back. 


He exits.  He returns quick. 
---
## PETER: 
Hey uh Cheryl. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Yeah hon. 

---
## PETER: 
I…  Can you not.  Call me Petey? 
---
## CHERYL: 
Oh fuck sorry. 
---
## PETER: 
It’s OK.  I uh…  I wouldn’t have said anything. 
---
## CHERYL: 
I’ve been calling you that for years like an asshole. 
---
## PETER: 
It’s fine it’s just. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Ugh I do that I give everybody a term of endearment. 
---
## PETER: 
Oh I mean that’s nice.  
---
## CHERYL: 
No it’s not appropriate.  I’ll stop. 
---
## PETER: 
I mean now I kinda wish I didn’t say anything.  I’m regretting that I 
said something. 
---
## CHERYL: 
I’ll call you whatever you wanna be called. 

---
## PETER: 
You can call me Petey then.  Pretend I never said anything.   
---
## LISSETTE: 
Can.  We go. 
Right!  Sorry!  Be right back. 
---
## PETER: 
Pause… 


---
## CHERYL: 
He’s a good egg that one. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Uh huh.   

---
## CHERYL: 
You are very lucky to have such good friends right now.  You know that, right? 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Yeah I’m.  Very lucky. 
Pause… 
---
## CHERYL: 
If you’d maybe just consider the condo we could. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Do what.  You want.   
---
## CHERYL: 
Hon I don’t wanna force you to do it.   
---
## LISSETTE: 
Whatever.  You want.   
Silence. 

Peter returns. 
---
## PETER: 
OK!  Keys returned!  I’m sorry about this I didn’t. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I said OK.  Many times. 
---
## PETER: 
Right!  We will.  We will find something with a ramp or an elevator. 

---
## CHERYL: 
Sounds good! 
---
## PETER: 
I have three more on my list!  One is right near here. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Not today. 
---
## PETER: 
It’s just a block away. 


---
## LISSETTE:

---
## PETER: 
We should see it though!  What if it’s perfect and we lose it. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Not today.

---
## CHERYL: 
Maybe you’ve had enough for today maybe you 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Not tired. 
---
## CHERYL: 
But maybe you’re pushing it.  Peter maybe she needs to go lie down for a bit. 
---
## PETER: 
Sure right whatever she needs. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I’m standing right here. 
---
## CHERYL: 
I know that hon. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Not.  A child. 
Nobody’s saying that.   
---
## CHERYL: 
Silence. 
---
## PETER:

---
## CHERYL: 
I think that’s a good idea.  Lissette hon what do you think.

## PETER:

## CHERYL:

---
## PETER:

## LISSETTE:

## CHERYL:

## LISSETTE:

## PETER:

Pause… 
---
## LISSETTE:

## LISSETTE: 
What’s wrong.  Am I.  Too much of.  A downer?  Did I ruin.  All the fun. With 
my.  Ginormous Black Hole of.  Negativity.  Sorry. 
---
## PETER: 
Not at all. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
You.  Asked me.  What. I’d.  Like.  To do and.  That’s.  What I want.  To do I.  I.

Pause… 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Fuck.  Can somebody.  Tie.  My shoe. 
Cheryl rushes over and ties it. 

away! And so. 
---
## PETER: 
So… It looks like there is a Thai restaurant!  Two blocks 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I wanna.  Go home. 
---
## CHERYL: 
OK baby we can do that. 

---
## LISSETTE: 
Alone.   
---
## CHERYL: 
That’s fine.  I will take you home and then I will… Go to a movie!  Petey you 
wanna go to a movie? 
---
## PETER: 
Sure lets go to a movie. 


---
## LISSETTE: 
I wanna get myself home.  By myself. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Are you sure that’s. 

---
## LISSETTE: 
I wanna get myself home. By myself. 
---
## CHERYL: 
But maybe we should 
---
## LISSETTE: 
AAAAAAARRRRRRGGGGGHHHH! 
BOTH OF YOU STOP.  FUSSING.  OVER ME.   
STOP IT!  
Everything stops.   
She slowly works her way to the door with her walker.  Her ankle gives out from 
under her and she falls to the floor.  Cheryl immediately goes to help her up but 
Lissette stops her. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Let me. Do it.  
She tries to get up and the ankle gives out again.  She tries again and falls again. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Ok fuck this I’m. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I said.  Let me.  Do it. 
She tries to get up off the floor and can’t. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Ok that’s it no more.  You wanna get treated like an adult?  Huh?  Stop acting 
like a freaking two year old.  There are times in this world when we gotta accept 
help from other people even if it sucks so get over yourself and accept it.  You 
hear me?    We’re taking you home.   And I’m not leaving you 
alone you can fucking complain and be shitty to me all you want.  I’m making 
the plan and you’re gonna deal with it.  Capiche?    Petey can you 
help me get her in a cab? 
---
## PETER: 
Yeah. 
---
## CHERYL: 
We gotta pick her up and we gotta get her into a taxi and then we gotta carry 
her up the stairs to her apartment. 


---
## LISSETTE: 
I’m so sorry. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Nothing to be sorry about kiddo we got this.  Right Petey?   

---
## PETER: 
Huh. 
---
## CHERYL: 
We got this.   
---
## PETER: 
Yeah.   
---
## LISSETTE: 
I’m sorry I’m so sorry I’m so so sorry. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Enough with this sorry business.   
Peter stays frozen and far away.  Unable to move.   
---
## CHERYL: 
Petey.  We got her, right? Right? 
---
## PETER: 
Right.     Right.   
Lissette and Peter mid-conversation. 
They are in an empty and dark hipster speakeasy.  Lissette is behind the bar 
making an elaborate cocktail. 
---
## PETER: 
Are you sure we should. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Oh my god stop worrying! 
---
## PETER: 
It feels like we’re breaking in. Is this legal? 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Dude!  I have keys!  We didn’t break in. 
---
## PETER: 
Yeah I know but still. 


---
## LISSETTE: 
Oh for fuck’s sake I work here this is practically my bar we didn’t break in.  
Would you rather go back to that shitty party Pete where your asshole date 
ditched you and play. 
---
## PETER: 
He really is a douchebag isn’t he. 

---
## LISSETTE: 
He is a ginormous douchebag Pete!  So would you rather be at that lame ass 
party playing a sad game of charades with Allison’s weird work friends or 
would you. 
---
## PETER: 
I need to stop dating douchebags! 
---
## LISSETTE: 
STOP DATING DOUCHEBAGS YES!  Or would you rather sit in an after hours 
bar and have the woman who Food and Wine just named the “future of bespoke 
cocktails”  make a. 
---
## PETER: 
Is that true?  That is very impressive. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Yes it’s true or would. 
---
## PETER: 
You’re a celebrity! 
---
## LISSETTE: 
SHHHHH.  I’m not a celebrity. 
---
## PETER: 
Sorry sorry I’ll stop interrupting. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
It’s OK It’s OK.  Or would you rather have that woman – ie me I am that woman 
– make a custom specialty “bespoke” cocktail just for you. 
---
## PETER: 
I would definitely prefer option number two. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Good choice Pete.  Lean into having an.  Epic adventure. 
---
## PETER: 
Yeah OK. 


---
## LISSETTE: 
That flutter in your stomach is what it feels to be alive Pete.  We are so lucky to 
be alive!  Doesn’t it feel great??? 
---
## PETER: 
I donno I think I might vomit. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
On your deathbed Pete.  Do you wanna be thinking fuck I should have done 
more things that scare me?  Fuck that shit.  That shit sucks.  Regrets suck.  
Devour life!  Next time we’re doing Absinthe.  But I can already tell I need to 
take baby steps with you.    OK now look me in the eye. 
---
## PETER: 
Looking someone in the eye is a little intense. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Agreed.  But you have to look people in the eye when you toast or you are 
cursed with 7 years of bad sex.  OK…  Raise your glass.    Here’s to…  
Living in the moment.  And.  New friends.  And.  Seven years of fucking amazing 
sex.  And.  Many many adventures. 
He goes to drink. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
No no not yet! 
---
## PETER: 
Ahhh sorry sorry! 
---
## LISSETTE: 
S’OK.    For my cousin Ruthie.  For Joey Curtis.  For Drea 
Antonetti.  For my dead Gram.  Not the one with Altzheimers.  For my Aunt 
Charleene.  You got anybody? 
---
## PETER: 
Huh? 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Dead.  Anybody dead you wanna toast to. 

---
## PETER: 
Oh…  Um I donno. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
It’s not a requirement or anything it’s just something I do – if you wanna do it 
too I’m.  Opening the floor. 
---
## PETER: 
My mom.  Maybe.    For my mom. 


---
## LISSETTE: 
And for Peter’s mom.  May you all rest in Peace.  We’ll see you when we see you.  
---
## PETER: 
We’ll see you when we see you. 

---
## LISSETTE: 
Salut.  L’chaim.  Slainte.  Proost.  Live.  Laugh.  Love. 
She kisses him full on the mouth.  They clink glasses. 
---
## PETER: 
Now? 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Yes yes now! 
They drink. 
---
## PETER: 
Wow that’s good. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I told you!  See what happens when you remain open to possibility Pete? 
---
## PETER: 
I do see.  I am currently reevaluating all of my life choices. 

---
## LISSETTE: 
I’m gonna call this drink a…  I’m calling it a.  A Motherfucking Shitfucker! 
---
## PETER: 
That’s quite a title. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
It feels good to say.  Say it. 
---
## PETER: 
Motherfucking Shitfucker. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Sometimes cursing is just so satisfying.  OK so the Motherfucking Shitfucker 
has.  Are you ready? 
---
## PETER: 
I am ready. 


---
## LISSETTE: 
Tequila.  Grapefruit.  Simple syrup.  Splash of soda.  Jalapeno.  It’s like a 
Paloma with a kick in the shins.  Like she’s refreshing and light and breezy and 
charming and then all of a sudden outta nowhere when you least expect it she 
kicks you in the shins. 

---
## PETER: 
She kicks you in the shins. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
YES!  OK so I’m gonna be honest with you Pete.  Can I call you Pete? 
OK? 
Is that 
---
## PETER: 
OH!  Um…  Well it’s not my favorite but it’s. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Sorry! 
---
## PETER: 
But it’s OK.    This Motherfucking Shitfucker is kind of 
extraordinary. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Aw Pete.  I may love you a little. 
---
## PETER: 
Are we there yet? 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Sure why not Pete why not I mean maybe Pete?  Maybe.  Maybe you and me 
maybe we are going to be such wicked fucking good friends from now on now 
for forever from now, right? 
---
## PETER: 
I’m not exactly sure what you just said but sure. 
LISSSETTE 
So Pete. 
---
## PETER: 
Lissette. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Tell me something about you that’s secret and exciting. 
---
## PETER: 
I’m not sure that I have. 


---
## LISSETTE: 
One thing!!  That nobody knows about.  Except for me now I’ll know and you 
will also know because it’s your thing to know. 
---
## PETER: 
It’s hard to think of something that nobody knows. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
ONE THING! 
OK FINE! 
weed. 
---
## PETER: 
Nobody knows.  Nobody knows that…  I.  Have never smoked 
---
## LISSETTE: 
How old are you??? 
---
## PETER: 
I just turned thirty. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Happy Birthday! 
---
## PETER: 
Thank you! 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Wait I have to give you a present where is your present I need to find you a 
present. 
---
## PETER: 
Really not necessary. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Oh!  OK get ready you ready? 
---
## PETER: 
I’m ready. 

---
## LISSETTE: 
This.   
penny.  This is very special and very lucky.  Here. 
This is my bicentennial 
---
## PETER: 
Thanks. 


---
## LISSETTE: 
This penny.  Was found on the corner of Broadway and 12th street in front of 
the Strand Bookstore after a really unfortunate date with an investment banker 
Allison fixed me up with.  I am giving you this penny as a token of our brand 
new best friendship.  You Pete you.  You are now the Luckiest Person.  In the.  
Entire World. 
---
## PETER: 
That’s a little overwhelming. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
But wait why have you never smoked weed. 
---
## PETER: 
Oh!  Uh.  Right.  That.  I uh…  I have never actually done any drugs of any kind.  
I’ve barely popped a Tylenol.  I maybe have never taken a Tylenol. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I’ve done all the drugs there are to do.  I’ve tried everything once.  I kind of wish 
I haven’t but I have so what can you do.    Why is it a secret? 
---
## PETER: 
Oh…  I donno.  I guess it’s a little embarrassing? 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Why. 
---
## PETER: 
Because it’s something that…  Most people have experienced. And so. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Who gives a shit what other people have experienced. 
---
## PETER: 
I guess It’s just. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
You are dodging the question Pete.  Why have you never smoked weed. 

---
## PETER: 
I…  Have never smoked weed because I…  There are some people in my life 
who… Were… High?  A lot?  And so…  I don’t want to be. 
Pause… 
---
## LISSETTE: 
But you drink. 
---
## PETER: 
Cleary I do. 


---
## LISSETTE: 
What’s the difference.   
---
## PETER: 
If it’s OK I would… Rather not talk about it? 

---
## LISSETTE: 
Sorry sorry of course it’s OK. 
---
## PETER: 
It’s no big deal I just. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
No no this is me I do this I just.  I barrel right over people’s boundaries and I. 
---
## PETER: 
I drink because I know I can stop drinking.  I have never done drugs because 
I’m not sure I’d be able to stop doing drugs.  And because a lot of people in my 
family drink and are functional.  But the ones who did and do drugs are not.  
Functional.  Or they are dead.  And so…    So yeah.  That’s why I drink 
but don’t do drugs. 
Pause… 
---
## PETER: 
What about you. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I told you.  I have done all the drugs there are to do so. 
---
## PETER: 
No what’s your biggest secret. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Oh. 
---
## PETER: 
What’s something about you that nobody knows. 

---
## LISSETTE: 
My.  Biggest Secret.  Pete is.  That…    Nobody has ever told me 
they love me.  Ever.  Like besides my mom.  And I donno.  Maybe my dead gram 
said it once.  But.  I’ve never been in love.  And so I’ve never said those words to 
someone.  Or had them said to me. 
---
## PETER: 
Me neither. 
Pause… 


---
## LISSETTE: 
What’s your biggest fear? 
---
## PETER: 
Dying alone. 

---
## LISSETTE: 
You didn’t even hesitate. 
---
## PETER: 
Oh yeah no that particular fear is like.  Omnipresent in my life.  It’s very 
specific.  Like.  I choke on a chicken bone and die. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Wait why a chicken bone?  That’s so random. 
---
## PETER: 
I know but it’s just always a chicken bone. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
OK I’m going with it. 
---
## PETER: 
And yeah so I choke on the rogue chicken bone and I die and nobody finds me 
till my neighbors start to complain about the smell. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
The smell.  Yeah that’s a good one. 
---
## PETER: 
What about you? 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Oh…    Um…  Mine is lame.  Mine is. 
reading my journals after I die. 
Someone 
---
## PETER: 
Oh no that’s horrifying! 

---
## LISSETTE: 
Right?  Like people you love going through your journals and reading weird shit 
you’ve said maybe even about them and.  Getting hurt.  It’s the worst!  So I’m 
always in this insane push pull of do I destroy them all while I’m alive?  But 
then what if I want to read them again?  Does any of it matter? 
Pause… 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I’m blushing. 


---
## PETER: 
You are. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I’m clearly embarrassed. 

---
## PETER: 
Why? 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I don’t know!  But I am. 
Pause… 
---
## PETER: 
Even though we barely know each other.  I promise you here.  Over this 
Motherfucking Shitfucker.  That if you suddenly and unexpectedly die.  I will go 
into your apartment and I will steal all your journals and I will shred all of them 
and I can say that because we’ve just met and so there will likely be nothing 
about me in them. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
But now that we’re best friends there may be lots of shitty stuff about you in 
the future. 
---
## PETER: 
That’s OK.  I can handle.  Shitty stuff. 

Pause… 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I think that’s the nicest thing anybody has ever said to me.  In maybe my whole 
life. 
---
## PETER: 
I totally mean it. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Thank you. 
---
## PETER: 
Sure.  


An outside bench.  Not a park bench.  A bench in the yard of an estate or a house. 
Cheryl is smoking with her back to Peter who watches.   
He keeps about to say something but doesn’t. 

She finishes her cigarette.  Puts it out.  Picks up the butt.   

She gets up off the bench and sees Peter. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Oh Christ on a cross Petey how long were you freaking standing there. 
---
## PETER: 
I was just. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Didn’t your mother tell you not to creep up on people like that. 
---
## PETER: 
Sorry I’m sorry I’m. 
---
## CHERYL: 
You better shut your mouth and not tell a damn soul that you saw me 
smoking out here. 
---
## PETER: 
I won’t I promise. 
---
## CHERYL: 
I know I probably reek of the fuckers but nobody needs to hear I had a witness.  
Capiche? 
---
## PETER: 
Yes.  Fully Capiche-ed. 
Pause… 
---
## CHERYL: 
You found this place right? 

---
## PETER: 
I did. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Aw kid you did good.  This place is gorgeous. 
---
## PETER: 
Air B N B. 


---
## CHERYL: 
What kinda asshole would put this gorgeous place on the internet for complete 
strangers.  Could you do that? 
---
## PETER: 
Probably not. 
---
## CHERYL: 
I tried to go in the crying room which.  No offense Petey and pardon my French 
– the crying room is really fucking retarded but I.  
---
## PETER: 
No offense… Taken. 
---
## CHERYL: 
But I went to the freaking crying room and I just sat there I felt so 
uncomfortable.  My eyes were bone fucking dry in the crying room so I…
then that annoying girl who sang that horrible Bette Midler song. 
And 
---
## PETER: 
Allison. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Right Allison.  Allison tried to freaking hug me.  And then my sister Annette 
started telling me about her goddamn knee replacement.  Who does that.  Like I 
want to hear about that today.  But so I had to get the hell outta there and so I.  
I came out here.  Talked to my dead mother.    I mean who knows if she 
hears anything but I felt like taking a chance. So… 
Pause.  They both still stand. 
---
## CHERYL: 
OK well I should go back, huh?  Let you be alone. 
---
## PETER: 
You can stay.  If you want you can stay.  You don’t have to if you don’t want to 
but if you want to I’m OK with you staying out here too.  If you…  Want.  But no 
pressure if you don’t you can go inside.  If you want. 

Pause… 

---
## CHERYL: 
You mind if I have another ciggy? 
---
## PETER: 
Only if you have one for me. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Petey you smoke??? 


---
## PETER: 
Sometimes. 
---
## CHERYL: 
That made me like you a little more.  And I already like you quite a bit. 

She lights a cigarette for him and hands it to him.  And then for herself. 

---
## PETER: 
Are these.  Do you smoke.  Virginia Slims. 
---
## CHERYL: 
I do I know it’s embarrassing. 
---
## PETER: 
I mean it’s actually kind of amazing.  It made me like you a little more.  And I 
already like you quite a bit. 
They smoke… 
---
## PETER: 
Are these even.  Do they have nicotine in them or are they just.  Decorative. 
---
## CHERYL: 
I donno.  I’ve been smoking these since I was thirteen.  I think I just like the 
whadyacallit.  The hand mouth thing.  I think it’s cuz I was bottle fed.  I think I 
read that somewhere.   

They smoke… 
---
## PETER: 
People love the lasagna. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Oh come on.  You’re just saying that. 
---
## PETER: 
I’m not.  There is weeping over the lasagna.  There are people right now in the 
Pardon my French – the fucking retarded crying room.  They are crying over 
that lasagna. That lasagna is a gift Cheryl.  You done good. 

---
## CHERYL: 
Now you’re making fun. 
---
## PETER: 
I swear on my mother that I’m not.   
---
## CHERYL: 
Don’t swear on your mother that’s terrible. 


---
## PETER: 
Fine I swear on nobody dead that the lasagna is extraordinary. 
---
## CHERYL: 
It doesn’t touch my mother’s.  My mother’s was a two-day affair. She made the 
sauce from scratch.  The meatballs.  That woman made her own freaking ricotta 
cheese.  Hand cut noodles.  Even at the end when her brain was pudding.  I 
swear to god if I said.  “Ma.  Make me a lasagna.”  She’d make me a lasagna.  
And it would be perfect.    
They smoke…   
---
## PETER: 
I gotta be honest with you Cheryl.  This cigarette isn’t truly satisfying. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Yeah I know.  It’s like a toothpick with a filter. 
They smoke… 
---
## CHERYL: 
I know this sounds coo coo but I swear to god my mother is here.  Today.  I 
keep hearing her in my head saying.  “I got the emphysema and you have the 
nerve to smoke Cheryl.  Screw you.”     Holy crap you see that. 
---
## PETER: 
What. 

---
## CHERYL: 
Don’t move. 
---
## PETER: 
OK… 
She puts her hand on his shirt. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Lookit that.  You see her. 

---
## PETER: 
Oh yeah. 
---
## CHERYL: 
You know what that means, huh? 
---
## PETER: 
What. 


---
## CHERYL: 
My Nana Marie useta say when you see a ladybug it’s somebody dead coming 
for a visit.   
---
## PETER: 
Huh. 
---
## CHERYL: 
That one’s definitely for you.   
She lets the ladybug fly away.  They smoke.   
---
## CHERYL: 
When didja lose your Mother, Petey   
to ask you.   
Sorry is that a weird thing 
No not at all.  I’m…
school. And so. 
---
## PETER: 
My.  My mother died.  When I was in middle 
---
## CHERYL: 
Oh shit you poor kid.   
---
## PETER: 
No no it’s OK I’m OK.   
---
## CHERYL: 
I just assumed you were all grown up not a little one aw jeeze hon. 
sorry. 
I’m so 
---
## PETER: 
It’s OK.  It was a long time ago I.  I don’t really even remember that much about 
her.  Anymore.  So.  It’s OK. 
---
## CHERYL: 
So who took care of you. 
---
## PETER: 
Um…    My sister and I.  We stayed with my grandparents for a while and 
then…  My grandfather died and so we.    What am I doing.  You don’t 
wanna hear all this. 
---
## CHERYL: 
I asked you about it remember.   
---
## PETER: 
I mean I. 


---
## CHERYL: 
I got a lotta loud crap in my head right now and I’d love to not hear it for a 
minute.  So.  Talk.   
---
## PETER: 
OK…  I…    Now I feel pressured to make it an interesting story I.  And it’s 
not.  Really.  My uh my sister and I we.  We lived with my grandparents and 
then my grandfather died and my grandmother couldn’t keep us so we…  She 
and I had different dads.  And her dad was useless and mine was less useless 
so I took my sister and we lived with my dad for a little bit.  And he was fine but 
also shitty.  So…  We moved in with my mom’s brother and it was fine.  He had 
a big family.  Lots of kids so.  So mostly we just tried to not get in the way?  
And…  I mean they were good people.  They loved us?  I think? They liked us 
OK.  But it was also weird.    And then I graduated and I went to college.  
My shitty father paid for that.  But my sister just kind of.  She didn’t graduate.  
She got pregnant.  She gave the kid up.  She’s kind of a mess.  And.  Uh…  So.  
Yeah.  That’s my.  Family.   
---
## CHERYL: 
Family is fucking crazy. 
---
## PETER: 
Yeah?    Yeah. 
She lights a cigarette for herself. And one for him. 
They smoke. 

---
## CHERYL: 
Here’s another shitty cigarette. 
Thanks. 
---
## PETER: 
They smoke.   
---
## CHERYL: 
If you ever wanna call me on you know like.  Holidays.  I would.  I wouldn’t 
mind that.  If you did that.   

---
## PETER: 
OK.    OK. 
Peter and Lissette 
---
## PETER: 
I’m sorry I’m really sorry. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Don’t be. 


---
## PETER: 
I’m just I. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I get it. 

---
## PETER: 
I will help you guys with.  With whatever you need and I’ll. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
It’s OK. 
---
## PETER: 
Stop it. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Stop what. 
---
## PETER: 
Being so nice about it. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Oh my god what do you want me to do? 
---
## PETER: 
Yell at me. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I’m not going to do that. 
---
## PETER: 
I suck as a friend. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I didn’t say that.  Did I say that? 
---
## PETER: 
No but I promised you.  I said I would live with you and that I’d. 

---
## LISSETTE: 
It’s a lot.  To ask.  Of a friend.  Of a platonic friend.  To. 
I mean I thought that you may bail. And so I. 
To be your caregiver I.  
---
## PETER: 
I’m sorry I’m so. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
It’s OK.  My mom will come and live with me.  Or I’ll just I’ll.  Hire somebody or 
something. 


---
## PETER: 
Can you afford that? 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I mean I’ll just whatever.  I’ll max out my credit cards or I don’t know.  It’s fine.  
It’ll be.  Fine. 
Pause… 

---
## PETER: 
I can help you find a great apartment. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Sure. 
---
## PETER: 
This is something I can do.  
---
## LISSETTE: 
This is true. 
---
## PETER: 
Everybody should have in their life.  A doctor a lawyer a dentist and a real 
estate agent. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Sounds like a plan. 
---
## PETER: 
What are you thinking.  Two bedroom.  Lots of light.  Downtown uptown. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I just need it to be.  Accessible. Yeah.  And two bedrooms.  And a.  I need a.  
Month to month lease? I think. 
---
## PETER: 
Why do you need a month to month lease. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Peter…  
---
## PETER: 
I’m not trying to be difficult but I. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Think about it.  Just.  Think about it.  
Pause… 
---
## PETER: 
When do you want me to start looking? 


---
## LISSETTE: 
I don’t know?  I…  Soon?  I guess?  The stairs are.  Getting hard.  And I.  I need 
to get a.  Walker?  And a.  Wheel chair will be soon after that and so.  Yeah.  
Soon.   
Pause… 

---
## PETER: 
You’re sure you’re not mad.   
---
## LISSETTE: 
I’m.  Not mad. 
---
## PETER: 
I suck as a friend I am the worst friend.   
---
## LISSETTE: 
Honestly?  Cheryl really wants to do it.  I think she was actually disappointed 
that I hadn’t asked yet. So.  
---
## PETER: 
I’m sorry I’m so. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Can you please just.  Stop apologizing? 
---
## PETER: 
Sure sorry yeah. 

---
## LISSETTE: 
It’s kind of making it worse.    I wish I was married. 
---
## PETER: 
To who? 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I donno. Anybody? I.  I wish I was married because then.  None of  
this would.  Be an issue.   If I were you and you’d asked me I.  I probably 
wouldn’t wanna do it either so.   

Pause… 

---
## PETER: 
I’ll help you both with whatever you need. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Just find me an awesome apartment. 
---
## PETER: 
I am so on it. 


Thanks.   Thanks. 
Need help with.   
---
## LISSETTE: 
I.  Um.  I.   
I have.  Something else I.  
---
## PETER: 
Anything. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Don’t you wanna.  Know what it is first? 
---
## PETER: 
Nope there is nothing you could ask me that I wouldn’t do. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Dude you just bailed on being my caregiver. 
---
## PETER: 
Fuck I know I’m sorry I’m so. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Relax I’m.  Fucking with you.    Kind of.   So…  I…  I need 
you to pause.  Whatever impulse you have about.  What I’m about to say and.  
Reserve any judgment and just.  Listen. 
---
## PETER: 
OK… 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I.  Have a lot of.  Decisions.  To make.  About my life.  About how I’m going to 
live my life.  And…  And…  How I want.  To die and. And I. 
---
## PETER: 
Who says you are going to die. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I mean I am definitely.  Going to die it’s just. 
---
## PETER: 
But what about Stephen Hawking. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Oh my god please please don’t. Bring up Stephen Hawking to me right now! 
---
## PETER: 
But he lived for a really long time and he.   
---
## LISSETTE: 
That’s like telling a kid who really wants a.  A pony that they should hold out 
for a.  Freaking unicorn.   


---
## PETER: 
It is nothing like that.   
---
## LISSETTE: 
It is one hundred percent exactly like that.   

---
## PETER: 
You can’t just assume that you’re going to die just because. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
You agreed to reserve.  Judgment. 
---
## PETER: 
I know I just. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
You agreed.  To listen.     I need to make some decisions soon.  
Because everything is.  My body is.  Changing quickly and I.  There are a lot of 
unknowns and I.  I need to.  I need a plan.  So.  I.    I want 
to.    When it’s time to go.  I want to do it.  On my own terms. And so I need.   
---
## PETER: 
Yeah I’m not talking about this right now. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Peter I. 
---
## PETER: 
Nope.  Sorry not today. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
You said I could ask you anything and that. 
---
## PETER: 
Not this. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Please don’t make me yell it’s.  Too hard.   

Pause… 

---
## LISSETTE: 
It’s just getting hard to.  Make words.  And raise my voice. The muscles in my 
throat are.    Not working so well and I.  Just please don’t make me.  Yell.  
I.     I can do it.  In Vermont.  Legally.   
---
## PETER: 
Do what. 


---
## LISSETTE: 
Peter… 
---
## PETER: 
I’m not having this conversation unless you say the fucking words. 

LISSETE 
Die.  OK?  I can die.  On my own terms.  In Vermont.   
---
## PETER: 
I can do a lot of things.  I can take a giant shit in the middle of the room right 
now if I want to but that doesn’t mean that I will. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
You promised that you would do whatever I asked. 
---
## PETER: 
Fuck you. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I don’t want.  A feeding tube.  I don’t want machines.  I don’t want someone 
wiping my ass.  I don’t want to.  I don’t want to.  Suffocate.  To death.  I want.  
To do this.  I am going.  To do this.  And you can either help me.  And be my 
friend.  Or you can.  Not help me and I will.  Figure out a way to do it.  On my 
own.  So.  It’s happening either way. One way with you.  One way alone.    
If I do it I.  I need to do it while I can still.  Lift my hand so.  I will need a plan in 
place and.  Ready to go when it’s time so I can just pull the trigger and say “lets 
do this”.  And.    I don’t know.  How much longer.  It’ll be till I.  Till I won’t 
be able.  To lift my hand.  Anymore.  
---
## PETER: 
Is this about living with your mother?  Because if it is then I will. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Fuck you. 
---
## PETER: 
I will I will live with you OK?  It’s a manipulative way to get me to do what you 
want but there you go.  You win.  I will move in with you. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
It’s not about my fucking mother.  I.    I don’t want to just wait around.  
To die. I’m really not sad about it I’m not scared I feel like.  I get it that maybe it 
sounds weird to you.  But it actually feels.  Empowering.  It’s the most.  
Empowered.  I’ve felt since I found all this out.  So.   
Pause… 
---
## PETER: 
So what do you need from me. 


I wanna have a party. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Pause… 
---
## PETER: 
A party. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Yes. 
---
## PETER: 
A what the fuck a death party? 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Totally. 
---
## PETER: 
Like we all take a road trip to Vermont together and eat chips and guac and 
maybe play a few rounds of Cards Against Humanity and get wasted and make 
smores and then you off yourself at the end and we all go home? 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Something like that. 
---
## PETER: 
That’s the most morbid thing that I’ve ever heard. 
---
## LISSETTE: 
Yeah I know. 
---
## PETER: 
But also kind of really.  Fucking beautiful. 
Pause… 
---
## LISSETTE: 
I know it’s weird and I know that it’s. 
---
## PETER: 
It’s not any weirder than anything else.  In this.  Weird fucking world.  So.  
So I…  I will help you.  OK?   
---
## LISSETTE: 
OK.  
---
## PETER: 
I will help you throw.  The most fabulous fucking kick ass death party that has 
ever existed in the entire history of the world.   


Lissette alone.  She stands next to her wheelchair.   
---
## LISSETTE: 
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.  Is.  A progressive neurodegenerative disease 
that affects nerve cells in the brain and the spinal cord.  It comes from Greek.  
Everything comes from Greek. Or Latin?  Maybe it’s Latin… Anyway! “A” means 
no.  “Myo” is Muscle.  “Trophic” means nourishment.  No muscle nourishment.   
So.  Starving muscles.   Muscles dying because nobody is feeding them.  Or 
they have stopped eating.  They are on a hunger strike your muscles.  And so 
everything that’s holding you together starts to come undone.  And that’s it. 
You just start unraveling like a ball of yarn and there is nothing to stop it.  
There’s no chemo there’s no surgery there’s no medicine there’s no fix there’s no 
maybe to hold on to.  No.  You’re gonna die that’s it end of story.  Because 
everything is muscles your head your heart your legs your arms your stomach 
your throat.  Your throat is muscles and so eventually pretty soon you can’t 
breathe and if you can’t breathe you die.  I mean yes sure we are all eventually 
going to die.  And some of us will die old and some will die young and the clock 
starts ticking from the second the sperm meets the egg and they have a sex 
party and they make a person the second that happens you are dying.  So yes 
we all know those horribly annoying “I could die tomorrow I could get run over 
by a car tomorrow so live your best life!”  people.   I hate those people.  Doesn’t 
everybody hate those people.  Those people fucking suck.  Stop it right now if 
you are one of those people.  Because everybody hates you.  Literally.  
Everybody hates you.    Most people didn’t inherit it.  So it’s just a 
surprise that shows up out of nowhere.  It isn’t avoidable.  No life hacks or kale 
or collagen peptides or paleo diet or vegan green smoothies or or or colonics or 
fasting or Namaste or Nam-myocho-renge-kyo or hashtag so blessed is gonna 
save you.  It’s living inside tucked away hiding till it finally decides to take over 
and one day you.  You can’t button your shirt.  It’s just a random weird thing 
you can’t button your shirt.  Your hands don’t know how to button a shirt 
anymore.  It’s not arthritis it’s not pain it’s just they can’t actually do the thing 
they’ve always done.  But you’re 38 years old so that’s weird because you’ve 
been buttoning your whole life but you can’t make it work.  And you shrug it off 
and you try not to fixate on it but you start bringing it up to people.  “Is that 
weird?  Has that happened to you?”  And everybody tells you “You’re young!  
You’re healthy!” The same people who undoubtedly say “Live your best life 
because we could all get hit by a car tomorrow!”  But something is nagging at 
you that a healthy person should be able to button a shirt.  And then you trip.  
Like you start tripping a lot.  Like your feet can’t take care of you anymore.  You 
feel like you’re walking on marshmallows.  And you feel flutters all the time.  
Like.  Butterflies.  Butterflies flapping their little wings all around your insides 
and so you google and you see “the thing” and you avoid “the thing” and you 
look for “a thing” that’s not “the thing” and you find magnesium.  Potassium.  
Supplement magnesium and potassium and you do it and maybe it’s better you 
think it’s better it’s not really better. Or maybe it’s cancer.   


---
## LISSETTE:  
Cancer actually would be better than “the thing”. 
happily take cancer.  Gladly.  But. 
At this point you would 
You. 

You still can’t button your shirt. 

So…  You go to the doctor because you have health insurance I mean it’s shitty 
health insurance but it’s something and so you should go to the doctor and the 
doctor does tests and the doctor calls and the doctor has you come in and the 
doctor can’t do anything but take a deep breath and tell you the facts. The facts 
are that the hand that can’t button the shirt will become the foot that can’t 
carry you where you want to go will become the throat that can’t swallow will 
become the head that can’t hold itself upright will become the voice that can’t 
scream will lead to feeding tubes to silence to air masks to recording your laugh 
so that you can still maybe laugh because what is a world where you can’t 
laugh can’t eat can’t hug can’t scratch an itch can’t fuck can’t run can’t can’t 
can’t. 
That all of this leads to death.  Death by suffocation.  Your body will suffocate 
itself.  Awesome right? 
I always hated running.  I have hated running since I was a kid and they made 
me run the mile and they timed me and me and Jen Hillman used to walk the 
whole way and talk about boys and piss off the gym teacher.  The gym teacher 
Dick Shohet who was very well named because he showed lots of girls his dick.  
But I wish I could run. I have dreams about running.  I dream that I’m 
screaming.  I dream that I’m running and screaming.  And kicking and 
punching and running and kicking and screaming and punching. 
And running.   
So yeah.  Somewhere between the buttons not buttoning and the wheelchair 
and the suffocating to death looming in the air you decide.  I decide.  I decided. 
I said in my head I said.  My terms.  I said.  No way I’m fucking going out like 
this. No fucking way I’m eating through tubes. And I said in my head.  Lissette.  
Girl.  You gotta do this while you can still move your hands or else they won’t 
let you.  I said no crying.  I said. Put on your big girl pants.  I said.  Do it before 
you can’t enjoy a meal or clutch the hand of someone you love.  I said make all 
the decisions you wanna make while you can.  Because the longer you wait the 
harder it will be to fight for what you want.  Because how do you fight without 
hands without a good punch without kicking and screaming.  So fuck that live 
your best life bullshit.  I want to get to have the best death.  My death is gonna 
be.  Fucking.  Epic.   
She sits in the chair.  She stays on stage and watches… 
Peter and Cheryl drink wine.  There are cupcakes.  With candles. 


---
## PETER: 
He’s a vet. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Oh that’s nice! 
---
## PETER: 
Is it? 
---
## CHERYL: 
Oh yeah.  Vets are good people.   
---
## PETER: 
He is.  He’s a good person. 
---
## CHERYL: 
But… 
---
## PETER: 
I’m allergic to animals.   
---
## CHERYL: 
Oh that’s a problem. 
---
## PETER: 
But I’m taking shots. 

---
## CHERYL: 
Good! 
---
## PETER: 
Because I really like animals.  I mean I’m definitely a dog lover. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Yeah I don’t trust people who don’t like dogs. 
---
## PETER: 
Right? 
---
## CHERYL: 
I always say it’s no big deal and then eventually those people turn out to be 
shits.   
---
## PETER: 
Yeah so I’m getting the shots. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Good good. 


---
## PETER: 
Because I like dogs and I.  Like him. And so yeah.  I am doing that.   
---
## CHERYL: 
That’s terrific. 

---
## PETER: 
It could be I.  Don’t want to jinx it with too many expectations. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Sure I get it but it sounds good. 
---
## PETER: 
Maybe. 
Pause… 
---
## PETER: 
But he’s great he’s. Really great. 
Pause… 
---
## CHERYL: 
Well that’s terrific. 
---
## PETER: 
Yeah thanks I like him. 

---
## CHERYL: 
How’d you two meet. 
---
## PETER: 
It was very old school.  It was a fix up.  There was no swiping involved. 
---
## CHERYL: 
I can’t with the swiping. 
---
## PETER: 
Yeah this was a.  We were fixed up by…  A sort of ex actually. 
fixed us up.  Donovan.  Do you know Donovan? 
A mutual ex.  He 

---
## CHERYL: 
Isn’t he the douchebag? 
---
## PETER: 
Yeah he’s… Not so bad but yes.  That’s him. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Maybe he’s not such a douchebag after all. 


---
## PETER: 
Nah he’s definitely a douchebag.  But.  You need one douchebag in every friend 
circle and so he.  He’s our douchebag. So.    So. He dated the Vet and he 
dated me and he decided we would maybe be a good fit and I guess we are.  
Maybe.  That.    The day of our first date he.  He’d had to put his own dog 
down.  Himself.  Can you imagine? 
---
## CHERYL: 
Oh that’s awful. 
---
## PETER: 
Yeah I um.  I had said look we can cancel but he didn’t want to.  He said I gotta 
get out of the house.  And so we.  We just went and had a coffee.  Walked 
around the park.  And it was nice.    It’s only been a month.  I’m trying 
not to make it a thing but I. 
---
## CHERYL: 
It’s OK to be hopeful. 
---
## PETER: 
Sure. 
---
## CHERYL: 
I’m telling you.  I’ve never met an asshole vet. 
What do you think? 
Maybe I should get a dog.  
---
## PETER: 
If you want. 
---
## CHERYL: 
The only pet I’ve ever had was a poodle.  It was my mothers and then my 
mother died and left my sister Annette a house and left me that fucking poodle.  
The house had rotten planks and the basement flooded.  Cost my sister an arm 
and a leg.  But that poodle lived till it was twenty two years old.  It was kind of 
an asshole but I gotta admit.  I loved that.  Fucking dog.  (She cries a bit but 
stops herself.)  Oh it’s nice to see you, hon.   
---
## PETER: 
You too. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Some days are better than others but this one.  This day is a real shit day. 
---
## PETER: 
Yeah. 
---
## CHERYL: 
But I like you so it’s nice to see you.  Takes the edge off.  I look forward to 
seeing you.  I like you more than I like a lot of people.  (She lights the candles on 
the cupcakes.)  One for you one for me.  We both get a wish.  You got one?   


---
## PETER: 
Yeah I think so. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Is it a good one?   

---
## PETER: 
It’s.  Moderate. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Better than nothing.  OK you ready?    It’s almost time.   
---
## PETER: 
I am ready. 
They both close their eyes.  Make their wishes.  Open their eyes and look at each 
other.  And blow out the candles. 
---
## CHERYL: 
I used to call her every year at the second she was born.  Every year.  I’d say 
“Happy Birthday to us!”  Until she got pissed and said “It’s not your birthday.”  
And I had to agree and so then I just said.  “Happy Birthday to you only.”  She 
was a preemie.  So tiny.  Only weighed five pounds.  I think it’s because I 
smoked like a pack a day the whole time I was pregnant.  What did I know. I 
was sixteen.  I was a mess.   
They start to eat the cakes.   

---
## PETER: 
How about you. 
---
## CHERYL: 
How about me what. 
---
## PETER: 
You dating anybody?    What???  You should date. 
---
## CHERYL: 
What the fucking hell do I need to do that for. 
---
## PETER: 
You’re still young. 
---
## CHERYL: 
I feel geriatric. 
---
## PETER: 
You don’t look it. 


---
## CHERYL: 
I feel it.  My knees.  My knees are ready to go. 
me.  They wanna retire.     
They are done.  With working for 
---
## PETER: 
When was the last date you went on? 
---
## CHERYL: 
Oh jeez louise a long time ago.  My pipes – sorry TMI alert – my pipes are 
backed up if you get my drift. 
---
## PETER: 
So…  Maybe you should.  Date. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Date.  Ugh.  What I’m gonna make a profile on a website?   
---
## PETER: 
Sure. 
---
## CHERYL: 
My friend Nancy came over once and I kid you not we drank a bottle of Titos 
and cranberry and we made a thingamajiggie for me.   
---
## PETER: 
And… 
---
## CHERYL: 
And nothing.  All the men my age wanted thirty year olds.  Which was 
depressing.  And so I kept getting half naked pictures of seventy year olds in the 
bathroom. So.  No sirree bub.  When my mother may she rest in peace was in 
the old folks home.  She always had all these geezers sniffing around and she 
always said.  “Cheryl – what I need that for.”  And I get it.  But.    But a 
dog maybe.  Maybe I’ll get a dog.    What’d you say this was again. 
---
## PETER: 
Malbac.  From Argentina. 
---
## CHERYL: 
It’s nice.  It sure beats the house wine at Mario’s Pizza lemme tell you.  (They 
toast.)  I think maybe I wanna travel.  I never traveled all my life.  Maybe I 
wanna do that.   
---
## PETER: 
Where would you go. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Not sure.  I’ve never been to Paris. 


---
## PETER: 
Paris is overrated. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Yeah I get that feeling about it. I think that’s why I’ve never gone. 

---
## PETER: 
Paris is trying too hard.  Go to Greece. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Maybe.  I did that DNA thing and it told me I’m a little Greek. So maybe.   
---
## PETER: 
Or Lisbon. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Sure. 
---
## PETER: 
Or maybe you should do like.  An Eat Pray Love, Cheryl.   
---
## CHERYL: 
Oh like that movie with whatshername Julia Roberts? 
---
## PETER: 
Yeah like an epic trip of self discovery.   
---
## CHERYL: 
I’m not sure I need all that.  That seems like a lot. 
Nashville. 
Maybe I’ll just go to 
---
## PETER: 
Or you could do that too.  
---
## CHERYL: 
I’ve always wanted to go to Nashville. 
---
## PETER: 
What’s in Nashville.   
---
## CHERYL: 
The Grand Ole Oprey.  I have always wanted to see that.  It’s on my bucket list. 
---
## PETER: 
Oh fuck hey look. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Hey look at what. 


---
## PETER: 
Shhhhh…  Don’t move. 
He points to something on the table.  They both look.  
---
## PETER: 
We have a tiny visitor.  

---
## CHERYL: 
Oh!  Yeah we sure do.    She’s a pretty one. 
Silence…  They both watch the ladybug.   
---
## CHERYL: 
Is it just me or is she looking right at us. 
---
## PETER: 
She’s looking right at us. 
Silence…  They maybe suddenly get a little weirded out. 
---
## PETER: 
Maybe you’ll meet a cowboy! 
---
## CHERYL: 
Huh? 
---
## PETER: 
At the Grand Ole Oprey. 
---
## CHERYL: 
Right!  Yes the Oprey.   Maybe.    
something I’ve always wanted to do. 
Or maybe I’ll just… Do 
---
## PETER: 
That’s OK too.  
---
## CHERYL: 
Yeah.  (She starts to cry.  She stops herself.  She takes a sip of wine.  She grabs 
Peter’s hand and holds it.)  Yeah.   

Lissette and Peter 
She is in her wheelchair. 
There is a large garment bag and a pair of shoes. 
We are back to the beginning.   


Peter is undressing Lissette.  He is gentle.  He moves slowly and purposefully. 
The negotiation of body parts is sometimes awkward sometimes beautiful.  
It should move from one to the other and then back again.  

---
## PETER: 
I can’t with Allison and the crying every five seconds.  I’m sorry.    
Had I known I wouldn’t have invited her.  She does this though, right?  Makes 
everything endlessly about her?  It’s.  It’s like.  Exhausting.    
Your mother thinks the crying room is “fucking retarded” and I think I maybe 
agree with her.    But.    How are you holding up.    
It’s a lot.    Are you OK do you need anything.    OK.  
OK.  Do you want me to send Allison to a hotel I can send her to a hotel?  (She 
shakes a small no.  He laughs.) Is this conversation stressing you out.  (She 
shakes her head no.)  OK.    OK.  We will.  Deal with Allison and the 
endless narcissism of her demonstrative crying.    You are a better 
human than I will ever be.   
Her head sort of falls sort of drops onto his head.  It’s not clear if this is a moment 
of purposeful connection or just a physical need to rest.  They sit like that for a 
moment.  Peter gets himself up abruptly.  He goes to the garment bag and unzips.  
Inside is the most gorgeous dress you have ever seen.  It’s like the perfect mix of 
confection and sophistication.  It’s beaded.   
---
## PETER: 
So are you ready?    She weighs a ton.  You’re lucky you don’t have 
to walk around in this.    Or these.  Are ladies meant to 
walk in these or just stand around and look pretty.  (She taps her nose.  The 
latter.)  Well lucky for you no standing, right?     
He unhooks all of the hooks.  He slips the gown over her head.  He maneuvers her 
into the gown.  One arm and then the other arm.  He lifts her up and pulls it down.  
He supports her with one arm while he patiently hooks all the tiny hooks.   
---
## PETER: 
Maybe we should’ve picked something with a zipper. 
Next time.   


He gingerly folds the clothes she had been wearing before and sets them to the 
side.  He puts the shoes on her feet.  He buckles.  He stands back.  He assesses.  
He gives an adjustment.   
---
## PETER: 
OK.  I…  Think you’re good.  
He rolls her to a mirror to see her reflection.  He stands behind her.  They look at 
themselves.   


---
## PETER: 
What do you think babe.  Thoughts.  Adjustments.  Notes.  Opinions.  (She 
shakes her head no.)  Really?  You don’t have one opinion???  This may be a 
lifetime first.  You don’t have any changes?  (She shakes her head no no no.  It’s 
perfect.) 

He gets his phone.  He takes a picture of her.  He takes a picture of the two of 
them.  He looks at the picture.  She makes a noise.   
---
## PETER: 
Sorry.   
He shows her the picture. 
---
## PETER: 
You clean up good, Kid.  If you get to wherever you’re going looking like that.  
Maybe you will finally achieve your teenage dream of fucking Kurt Cobain. Or 
River Phoenix.    If that happens will you find a way 
to let me know.  Send me a sign.    So I…  I have a letter.  I know 
it’s against the rules and I don’t need to read it but.    Is that a 
thumbs up for me not reading.    It’s a thumbs up for 
reading.    You want me.  To read the letter.    
I mean now I’m feeling like maybe the letter sucks and I shouldn’t.  Maybe we 
should cancel the letter reading.    Do you want to just 
read it?    I need to read it to you.    OK…  
OK.  I will do that.  I will.  Read the letter.    It’s not 
really a letter it’s more like a list.  I wrote you a list.    I will try and 
read it not awkwardly.  Here we go.   
He takes a breath. 
---
## PETER: 
So just ahead of time I want you to know that I wrote this kind of stream of 
consciously and so I donno some of it may be weird.  If it’s weird I’ll stop?  Or 
you can tell me to stop or.  OK I’m just I’m gonna read this so I can get you 
back to all The People.  I’ve kept you away too long from The People. 

---
## PETER: 
I know you asked that there not be any letters.  And I’m.  Sorry for not 
respecting that wish.    That’s in the letter I wrote that at the top.  
I know we already discussed this just now but I’m.  I am committed to reading 
the entire thing – preamble included.    But…  I feel 
like.  That’s bullshit.  And I feel like.  People always say that they don’t want 
presents at birthdays.  They say “Just bring yourself!” and then you listen to 
them and don’t bring a present and you feel like an asshole so.  I’m writing a 
letter!  Yay!   People are always wishing they had told someone something 
before they.  Miss the opportunity to tell them those things and so I am telling 
you these things.  Whether you like it or not.  Because. I.  Get to do that.   


---
## PETER:  
So…    That was the preamble.  Now I’m going to read the 
list.  Twenty Things I Love about my friend Lissette Marie Esposito.  1. Her spot 
on imitation of Al Pacino.  2.  Her ridiculously in depth knowledge of 90’s music 
– all genres.  2A.  The fact that she still makes mix tape cassettes and gives 
them to people as gifts.  3.  The way she calls me on my bullshit in a way that 
nobody else does.  4.  Her passion for cooking.  4a. Her chocolate chip cookies 
and her lentil soup and her truffle popcorn.  5.  Her ability to always be 
authentic to who she is.  6.  Her kick ass honest and real and so full of love 
relationship with her mom.  That.  I’m gonna be honest.  I’ve always been a little 
jealous of.  7.  The way she still picks up pennies off the street and the way she 
screams “Luck!  I have all the luck!!  I am so lucky!  I am the fucking luckiest!” 
when she finds them.  Like a little kid.  And then does a little dance.  And reads 
the date.  And then recites a random fact from that date.  7b.  The way she 
sometimes gives said penny and bestows that luck to.  Whoever she’s with at 
the time.   1976.  Oooh.  The Bicentenial.  Do you 
remember that one?    8.  Her generosity.  9.  Her unabashedly real 
and unapologetically true deep passion for all things Abba, Veronica Mars, the 
color orange and Anne Rice.  10.  The way she talks back at movies as if the 
movie can hear her.  11.  How she can make a stranger feel like an old friend.  12.  Her laugh.  (He stops.  He begins to cry and he turns away from her.  
Gathers himself together.  And then comes back.)  OK! Where were we…12 A.  
The way her nose crinkles during said laugh.  13.  Her insanely impressive 
vocabulary.  14.  Her clarity and confidence about what she wants. And her 
stubborn will to go after it.  15.  Her aversion to anything sentimental. Sorry I 
didn’t realize this was such a long list.  We are almost at the end I promise.  16.  
Her kindness and patience towards people who don’t always deserve it.  17.  
The way her Boston accent comes out when she’s drunk.  18.  (A beat.  A 
breath.) 18.  Her annual Friendsgiving the week after the one we all had to do 
with our insane families.  19.  Her ruthless competitiveness in board games.  
And.  20.   I love that she’s my friend.  And that I got the chance to 
know her.  And I’m going to miss her.  You.  I’m going to miss you.  I’m going to 
miss you.  A lot.  And.    I’ll…  See you when I see you.    That’s it 
that’s the end.   
He looks up from the letter.  She’s crying.

## PETER: 
Oh fuck I’m sorry I didn’t mean to make you -  
---
## PETER: 
Just.  I guess just.  Let me know when you’re ready when you want to go back.  
And we’ll… Get you back? 


She cries and laughs. Eventually it starts to wind its way down.  Her breathing 
slows and slows and slows.  She gets to the end.  She exhales.   
Quiet. 
They look at each other.  They both take deep breath.  She gives a thumbs up. 
End of play.
