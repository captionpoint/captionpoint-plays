phone rings

## WOLF:
Wolf. 
---
Eight sixty-four. 
---
Boxed for a dollar
---
Yeah, I got that.
---
## MEMPHIS:
Hey, Wolf, 
---
I told you about that. 
---
You can't be tying up my phone 
---
with them numbers.
---
## WOLF:
Seven thirty-one straight 
---
for a dollar. 
---
Okay.
---
## MEMPHIS:
I told you about tying up my phone 
---
with them numbers. 
---
I don't want that in here.
---
## WOLF:
Who's trying to call you? 
---
Risa will tell you 
---
ain't nobody trying to call you.
---
## MEMPHIS:
My lawyer might be trying to call me.
---
## WOLF:
That's what happened to Harvey 
---
before he got them ten years. 
---
He sitting around 
---
waiting for his lawyer to call
him. 
---
If I was him 
---
I would have been in Cleveland 
---
or Detroit. 
---
Naw, he wanna sit around 
---
and wait on his lawyer to call him.
---
## MEMPHIS:
This a civil lawyer. 
---
There's more than one kind of lawyer. 
---
But you don't know nothing about that.
---
## WOLF:
I know there's different kinds of lawyers. 
---
The NAACP got all kinds of lawyers. 
---
It don't do nobody no good. 
---
Hey, Risa, give me some sugar.
---
## MEMPHIS:
That's the second time this week 
---
that six fifty-one hit. 
---
I don't know the last time 
---
I can recall a number coming twice 
---
in the same week. 
---
That was L.D.'s number. 
---
If he was still living 
---
he'd be in big money.
---
## WOLF:
They had that six ninety-four 
---
come twice about a year ago. 
---
Milt hit for five dollars 
---
both times. 
---
Got mad 
---
cause he didn't have twenty dollars on it.
---
Let me get some sugar, Risa.
---
## MEMPHIS:
I remember that. 
---
I had six ninety-six. 
---
I switched off to six ninety-two 
---
and it come back six ninety-four. 
---
I remember that. 
---
You talk about Milt being mad.
---
## RISA:
I don't know why people waste 
---
their money playing numbers. 
---
Time you hit 
---
you just getting back 
---
what you put in.
---
## WOLF:
It's the same thing 
---
as putting money in the bank.
---
This way you might take out more 
---
than you put in
---
but Mellon ain't gonna 
---
let you do that. 
---
The numbers give you an opportunity. 
---
If it wasn't for the numbers 
---
all these niggers would be poor.
---
## MEMPHIS:
It wasn't till I hit the numbers 
---
eight or nine years ago 
---
that I got to the point 
---
where I could change my clothes every day. 
---
See, most of these niggers 
---
around here can't do that. 
---
The only way they can do that 
---
is to hit the numbers 
---
or get lucky in a crap game. 
---
The ones that working 
---
the only way they can do anything 
---
is to wait on their income tax return. 
---
Half the time 
---
the government cheat them out of that.
---
## WOLF:
You hear from your old lady, Memphis?
---
## MEMPHIS:
Don't bring up that woman to me. 
---
I ain't heard from her. 
---
I know where she at. 
---
She up her sister's house.
---
She been up there them 
---
two months since she left.
---
Twenty-two years. 
---
I give her everything I had 
---
for twenty-two years.
---
Naw naw 
---
I give her everything I had
---
when I met her 
---
then I give her everything 
---
I could get hold of 
---
for the next twenty-two years. 
---
And then when she was leaving 
---
she wouldn't even shake my
hand.
---
## WOLF:
I know how that go. 
---
That's why I don't mess wit'
these women 
---
but so far.
---
## MEMPHIS:
I ain't never left nobody in bad manners. 
---
I'm standing there 
---
trying to say, 
---
"May God bless you everywhere you go" 
---
and she wouldn't even shake my
hand.
---
## RISA:
Maybe she didn't like the way 
---
you was treating her.
---
## MEMPHIS:
I treat that woman like she was a queen. 
---
Treat her like she made out of gold. 
---
Try to give her everything
she want. 
---
She say 
---
"Baby, I want a car," 
---
she got a Cadillac. 
---
She want a TV she got a color TV. 
---
It might take me a little while. 
---
Her wants might be too big for my
pocket 
---
but I work it out 
---
and come up with something. 
---
I was working on the dishwasher 
---
when she walked out. 
---
I would have got her that 
---
but the plumbing got to be right.
---
I'm talking to John D. 
---
about him fixing up the plumbing
---
and she got up and walked out the door. 
---
You talking about 
---
she tired of the way I treated her. 
---
I treated that woman 
---
like she was the Queen of Sheba.
---
## RISA:
Maybe she don't see it like that. 
---
She had to leave for something.
---
## MEMPHIS:
I ain't done nothing 
---
but ask her to get up 
---
and make me some bread. 
---
And she got up 
---
and walked out the door. 
---
I know she don't expect me to make it myself.
---
Got up and walked out the door! 
---
I went down there and saw her. 
---
Asked her what the matter was. 
---
She told me she was tired. 
---
Now, how you gonna get more tired than I am? 
---
I'm the one going out there 
---
wrestling with the world. 
---
She ain't got to do nothing 
---
but stay home 
---
and take care of the house. 
---
She got it nice. 
---
Talking about she tired. 
---
She wasn't too tired to make them four babies.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
Hey, Wolf.
---
## WOLF:
What's happening, Holloway?
---
## HOLLOWAY:
The people lined up 
---
all the way up there 
---
past Webster to see Prophet Samuel. 
---
They was lined up there
---
before the doors open. 
---
West ain't had a chance 
---
to open his door good 
---
before they was all tramping 
through there.
---
They got a line all the way up past Webster. 
---
They done had two fellows 
---
get in a fight about gypping the line.
---
## WOLF:
Where?
---
## HOLLOWAY:
Just now as I was coming down. 
---
Man tried to slide in there 
---
beside somebody he knew 
---
and got in a fight about it.
---
## WOLF:
I knew it was gonna be crowded. 
---
I didn't know they would be lined up.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
Lined clear up to Webster. 
---
It take you an hour 
---
to get in there to see him.
---
## WOLF:
They say how he died?
---
## MEMPHIS:
Ask Risa. 
---
She should know. 
---
She running up there 
---
giving the man her money.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
They say he had a stroke.
---
## MEMPHIS:
I believe one of them old 
---
sandal-foot woman
---
poisoned him. 
---
I wouldn't be a bit surprised. 
---
Got all them women 
---
walking around his house together 
---
I wouldn't be a bit surprised 
---
if one of them didn't get jealous 
---
and poison him.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
They over there now 
---
greeting the people 
---
and falling all over the place. 
---
All seven or eight of them.
---
West can't wait to bury that nigger. 
---
One of them wanted to charge 
---
the people to see him, 
---
but West wouldn't have that over there. 
---
You think I'm lying, 
---
don't you? 
---
They had a little basket 
---
they put over there right by the casket.
---
They was charging people 
---
a dollar to see him 
---
before West put a stop to it.
---
## MEMPHIS:
When they gonna bury him?
---
## WOLF:
Tuesday. 
---
They say they gonna bury him Tuesday.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
They gonna try and bury him Tuesday. 
---
West ain't gonna bury him 
---
until the people got a chance to
see him.
---
## WOLF:
They say he got hundred-dollar bills 
---
in the casket with him.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
He got hundred-dollar bills 
---
got diamonds on all his fingers.
---
They got it roped off. 
---
You can't get within 
---
ten feet of the casket. 
---
He got gold and jewels 
---
and everything in there with him.
---
## WOLF:
What they supposed to bury him 
---
with all that money?
---
## MEMPHIS:
West ain't gonna bury that man 
---
with that money. 
---
West ain't no fool. 
---
You think he gonna put
---
money and diamonds 
---
and all that gold in the ground?
---
Half the time he don't even put the casket. 
---
Half the time he dump the body out 
---
and bring the casket back to sell
it again. 
---
Bury somebody else in it.
---
## RISA:
West don't be doing that. 
---
That's against the law.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
West done buried four or five 
---
niggers in the same suit. 
---
How you think he got all that money?
---
## WOLF:
Who would you say 
---
had the most money
---
West or Prophet Samuel?
---
## HOLLOWAY:
Everybody know West got money. 
---
He get more business. 
---
More people dying than getting saved.
---
## WOLF:
Prophet Samuel got a lot of money. 
---
He right up there with West. 
---
He be cheating 
---
and fooling the people
---
all these years.
---
## RISA:
He ain't done nothing 
---
but tell the truth. 
---
Most times 
---
people don't want to hear the truth. 
---
But Prophet Samuel
---
say the truth ain't nothing to be afraid of. 
---
He say if you afraid of the truth 
---
to get back in the shadows 
---
cause you never will see the light.
---
## WOLF:
I ain't said all that. 
---
I just said 
---
he right up there with West 
---
when it comes to money. 
---
All them jewels and things he had. 
---
That big old white Cadillac. 
---
Seven or eight women. 
---
He was living a nice life.
---
## MEMPHIS:
He ain't got nothing now. 
---
He ain't got as much as you got. 
---
And I don't believe 
---
he had as much money as West. 
---
West got money he ain't even counted.
---
## WOLF:
How much money would you say he got?
---
## HOLLOWAY:
West got a million dollars. 
---
Got it two or three times.
---
## MEMPHIS:
And don't know how to spend it. 
---
Man living up over top 
---
of the funeral home
---
you'd think he'd have enough sense 
---
to buy him a house somewhere. 
---
He own every other building around here. 
---
Them that Hartzberger don't own. 
---
I got lucky 
---
and got hold to this piece of building 
---
and West got mad. 
---
I got it right out 
---
from under his nose 
---
and he ain't never forget that.
---
All that property he own 
---
and had the nerve to get mad 
---
when I bought this. 
---
What make it so bad 
---
is he could have had it. 
---
He was talking to L.D. 
---
about buying the building from him. 
---
L.D. had his stroke 
---
and West figured he'd
---
wait until he died 
---
and get it cheaper. 
---
I went over to the hospital to see him 
---
and we made the deal right there 
---
in the hospital 
---
about a week before he died. 
---
I got it for fifty-five hundred dollars. 
---
This is when I was walking around 
---
with four or five hundred dollars 
---
in my pocket every day. 
---
Used to carry a pistol and everything. 
---
Had me a .44. 
---
Had me one of them big .44s. 
---
Used to scare me to look at it. 
---
I give L.D. the fifty-five hundred in cash. 
---
I didn't find out till after he died 
---
that he owed twelve hundred dollars 
---
in back taxes 
---
but I didn't care. 
---
I had seen a way 
---
for me to take off my pistol. 
---
I got my deed 
---
and went right home 
---
took off my pistol
---
and hung it up in the closet. 
---
West got mad when he found out 
---
L.D. sold me the building. 
---
He been trying to buy it from me ever since. 
---
He walked in the next day
---
and offered me eight thousand dollars for it. 
---
That was a good price. 
---
But see he didn't know 
---
it had come to mean more to me than that. 
---
I had found a way to live the rest of my life.
---
## WOLF:
When they gonna tear it down?
---
## HOLLOWAY:
You know how the city is. 
---
They been gonna tear this whole block down 
---
for the last twenty years.
---
## MEMPHIS:
They told me to be downtown Tuesday. 
---
They liable to wait another twenty years 
---
before they tear itdown, 
---
but I'm supposed to be down there Tuesday 
---
and find out how much they gonna give me.
---
## WOLF:
What you gonna do 
---
when they tear it down?.
---
## MEMPHIS:
Ain't nothing to do. 
---
Unless I do like West 
---
and go into the undertaking business. 
---
I can't go out there 
--
in Squirrel Hill 
---
and open up a restaurant. 
---
Ain't nothing gonna be left around here. 
---
Supermarket gone. 
---
Two drug-stores. 
---
The five and ten. 
---
Doctor done moved out.
---
Dentist done moved out. 
---
Shoe store gone. 
---
Ain't nothing gonna be left 
---
but these niggers killing one another. 
---
That don't never go out of style. 
---
West gonna get richer 
---
and everybody else 
---
gonna get poorer. 
---
At one time you couldn't get a seat in here. 
---
Had the jukebox working and everything. 
---
Time somebody get up 
---
somebody sit down 
---
before they could get out the door. 
---
People coming from everywhere. 
---
Everybody got to eat 
---
and everybody got to sleep. 
---
Some people don't have stoves. 
---
Some people don't have nobody 
---
to cook for them. 
---
Men whose wives done died 
---
and left them. 
---
Cook for them thirty years 
---
and lay down and die. 
---
Who's gonna cook for them now? 
---
Somebody got to do it. 
---
I order four cases of chicken 
---
on Friday and Sunday it's gone. 
---
Fry it up. 
---
Make a stew. 
---
Boil it. 
---
Add some dumplings. 
---
You couldn't charge more than a dollar. 
---
But then you didn't have to.
---
It didn't cost you but a quarter. 
---
People used to come from all over. 
---
The man used to come twice a week 
---
to collect the jukebox. 
---
He making more money than I am. 
---
He pay seventy-five cents 
---
for the record 
---
and he make two hundred dollars off it. 
---
If it's a big hit 
---
he's liable to make four hundred. 
---
The record will take all
---
the quarters you can give it. 
---
It don't never wear out.
---
The chicken be gone by Sunday. 
---
It ain't nothing like that now. 
---
I'm lucky if I go through 
---
a case a chicken a week. 
---
That's alright. 
---
I'll take that. 
---
I ain't greedy.
---
But if they wanna tear it down
---
they gonna have to meet my price.
---
## WOLF:
They ought to give you a good price. 
---
That's what I hear 
---
when the city buy something 
---
they give you a good price.
---
## MEMPHIS:
They give white folks a good price. 
---
Most time that be who they buying it from. 
---
Well, they gonna give me 
---
just like they give them. 
---
I bought it eight years ago
---
for fifty-five hundred dollars 
---
and I ain't taking a penny
less 
---
than twenty-five thousand.
---
## WOLF:
You ought to be able to get that.
---
## MEMPHIS:
Let me get a dollar 
---
on that seven sixty-four. 
---
If that come out 
---
that'll hold me 
---
till the city do their paperwork. 
---
If that come out 
---
I might buy me a new pair of shoes. 
---
I ain't going to be like West. 
---
West been wearing the 
---
same pair of shoes for three years. 
---
Got the heels all run over 
---
and everything. 
---
He do keep them shined. 
---
I'll say that for him. 
---
I ain't never seen him 
---
without his shoes shined.
---
## WOLF:
I ain't never seen him 
---
without them gloves. 
---
He wear them gloves everywhere. 
---
I believe he wear them to bed.
---
I hear tell he got a wooden hand.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
West ain't got no wooden hand. 
---
He be touching them dead people 
---
I'd wear gloves too.
---
## WOLF:
He can take them off and wash his hands. 
---
He don't be touching them all the time. 
---
I ain't never seen him
---
without them gloves. 
---
I ain't never seen him 
---
in nothing but black. 
---
Everything he wear is black. 
---
Black hat. 
---
Black suit. 
---
Black shoes. 
---
Black tie. 
---
The only thing he wear 
---
is that white shirt. 
---
Everything else is black.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
That's what he supposed to wear. 
---
All undertakers wear black. 
---
What it look like 
---
if he showed up to bury somebody 
---
in a red suit? 
---
They supposed to wear black.
---
## WOLF:
He do make them bodies look good. 
---
Make them look natural.
---
## MEMPHIS:
People kill me with that. 
---
How somebody dead gonna look natural?
---
## WOLF:
That's what the people say. 
---
Say they look better
---
than when they was living. 
---
That's why the people like
West.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
The people like West 
---
cause he get the cars 
---
there on time. 
---
He say he be there 
---
to pick you up at one o'clock 
---
that's what time he come. 
---
He be real nice
---
and polite
---
it's "No sir" 
---
and "Yes ma'am." 
---
"Watch your step." 
---
"Can I get you some water?" 
---
The people like that. 
---
You even act like you want to faint 
---
and West will be right there 
---
at your elbow.
---
## MEMPHIS:
He do all that 
---
after he got the money.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
Quite naturally 
---
he gonna get the money first.
---
## MEMPHIS:
You go over there 
---
looking for a pine box 
---
and walk out 
---
with a five-thousand-dollar silver, 
---
satin-lined casket, 
---
guaranteed to be leak-proof. 
---
That's what get me.
---
For an extra hundred dollars 
---
he give you a twenty-year
guarantee 
---
that the casket ain't gonna leak 
---
and let the water seep in.
---
Now how dumb can anybody get? 
---
You gonna dig up the casket 
---
twenty years later 
---
to see if it's leaking 
---
and go back and tell West  
---
and get your hundred dollars back? 
---
The first time it rain 
---
the water's liable to drown the corpse. 
---
You don't know. 
---
Yet you be surprised 
---
at the number of people 
---
come out of there talking about
---
their twenty-year guarantee. 
---
Then if that ain't enough
---
he charge you another hundred dollars 
---
to get a casket that lock. 
---
Like somebody gonna go down there 
---
and steal the body 
---
if it ain't locked up. 
---
Yet they come out of there
---
clutching this little key he give them. 
---
West the only nigger I know 
---
who can cheat and rob the people 
---
and they be happy to see him. 
---
Calling him "Mr. West." 
---
"How you doing, Mr. West?" 
---
"Have a nice day, Mr. West."
---
"Good to see you, Mr. West." 
---
He done cheated them
---
out of four or five hundred dollars 
---
and they talking about
---
"Have a nice day, Mr. West."
---
## WOLF:
I don't want West to bury me. 
---
I'll go anywhere else. 
---
Charles. 
----
McTurner. 
---
Harris. 
---
I'll let anybody bury me but West. 
---
Hell, I'm liable to do 
---
like the white folks do 
---
and get cremated.
---
## MEMPHIS:
What you got against West?
---
## WOLF:
I ain't got nothing against him. 
---
I just don't want him 
---
standing over me when I'm dead. 
---
I'd rather have a stranger standing over me.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
You ain't gonna know nothing about it. 
---
What you care 
---
who be standing over top of you? 
---
You talk foolish. 
---
West don't care nothing about you. 
---
The last person West buried 
---
that he cared about 
---
was his wife. 
---
He don't care nothing about you. 
---
You just be another dead nigger to him. 
---
I doubt if West can tell 
---
one nigger from another. 
---
Man got four or five viewing rooms 
---
and don't have no trouble 
---
keeping somebody in all of them. 
---
I remember one time 
---
he had two niggers laid out 
---
in the hallway 
---
and one on the back porch. 
---
Most of them had welfare caskets, 
---
but West don't care 
---
cause the government pay on time. 
---
He might have to worry his money
---
out of some of them other niggers, 
---
but the government pay quicker 
---
than the insurance companies.
---
## MEMPHIS:
Wasn't nothing 
---
but a pine box 
---
with some cloth stretched over it. 
---
That's what the welfare casket was.
---
## WOLF:
They ain't changed. 
---
That's what they is now.
---
## HAMBONE:
He gonna give me my ham. 
---

## MEMPHIS:
Well, take it out the freezer, 
---

---
Tell him you forgot to thaw it out.
---
## RISA:

---

---
You used to be a little skinny
old thing. 
---
You don't remember me? 
---
Sterling Johnson.
---
Used to be with Rodney 
---

---
You don't remember me? 
---
That's alright, 
---
I remember you.
---
## MEMPHIS:
Risa, get on back there 
---
and get to work. 
---
You ain't got time 
---
to be standing around talking.
---
## STERLING:
This an old friend of mine. 
---
I knew her before you did. 
---
Her name is Clarissa Thomas. 
---
She got a brother named Rodney.
---
## MEMPHIS:
I don't care how long you known her. 
---

---
She can't be standing around talking. 
---
She got things to do.
---
## STERLING:
Say, baby, 
---

---
I can't take care of you. 
---
I'm trying to find a job myself. 
---
I just got out the penitentiary.
---
## RISA:
I ain't worried about getting fired.
---
## STERLING:
Where's Rodney staying? 
---
I kinda got out of touch with him.
---
## RISA:
He moved to Cleveland. 
---
He said he had to get out
of Pittsburgh 
---
before he kill somebody.
---
## STERLING:
Me and him 
---
had some fun times together. 
---
You remember 
---
I used to come up to the house 
---
and eat all the time? 
---
That was you 
---
that was doing all the cooking.
---
Rodney say,
---
"Come on, man, 
---
my sister got something to eat." 
---
Then we used to come up there. 
---
You used to be skinny.
---
## RISA:
I wasn't all that skinny.
---
## STERLING:
I don't know how skinny you were 
---
but you sure grown up now. 
---
What's your phone number?
---
## RISA:
I ain't got none.
---
## STERLING:
Well, what's the address? 
---
If I can't walk 
---
I'll crawl up there.
---
## MEMPHIS:
Risa, get on back there 
---
and get that chicken fried up 
---
so you can go get West his pie 
---
before he be over here.
---
## RISA:
I'm frying it!
---
## STERLING: 
Seem like to me 
---
if you come to work all the time 
---
and can't talk to nobody, 
---
then I don't know who 
---
would want that job. 
---
It's like being in school 
---
with somebody always telling you 
---
what to do.
---
## WOLF:
How you doing? 
---
I seen you down at Irv's.
---
## WOLF:
Yeah, I be down there sometimes.
---
## STERLING:
I just got out the penitentiary. 
---
I was down at Try's yesterday. 
---
But I figure 
---
I hang out down there 
---
I'll be right back down the penitentiary. 
---
I don't want that.
---
I'm trying to find a job. 
---
You know where I can get a
job? 
---
Anybody know where I can get a job at?
---
## HOLLOWAY:
What kind of job you looking for?
---
## STERLING:
Any kind. 
---
I can do anything.
---
## WOLF:
Go up and see Hendricks. 
---
He got a construction company.
---
## STERLING:
That's who I was working for. 
---
He helped me get out the penitentiary. 
---
I work for him one week 
---
and he laid me off, 
---
say he ain't had enough business 
---
to keep me working. 
---
He say he'd call me 
---
if he had any work for me.
---
## MEMPHIS:
Go on over the steel mill. 
---
A big strong boy like you 
---
if you ain't scared of work 
---
they got work over there.
---
## STERLING:
That's what Hendricks told me. 
---
I went over to J&L Steel 
---
and they told me 
---
I got to join the union 
---
before I could work. 
---
I went down to the union 
---
and they told me 
---
I got to be working 
---
before I could join the union. 
---
They told me to go back 
---
to the steel mill 
---
and they'd put me on a waiting list. 
---
I went and asked my landlady 
---
if I could put her on a waiting list. 
---
She told me if I didn't give her 
---
twelve dollars by Friday 
---
I could wait on the street.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
You can go up to Boykins 
---
and see if he need anybody. 
---
You know Boykins up on Herron 
---
what got that junkyard? 
---
He always complaining he can't keep nobody.
---
That's probably cause he don't pay nothing. 
---
But you can go up there and see him.
---
## STERLING:
I ain't got nothing to lose. 
---
I'll go up there.
---
Thanks. 
---
Anybody want to buy a watch?
---
I carried it up to the pawnshop 
---
he didn't want it either. 
---
It got seventeen jewels. 
---
That's what it say right
here. 
---
I don't know what kind of jewels they are 
---
they don't tell you that part. 
---
It's liable to be anything. 
---
You open it up it's liable to be 
---
diamonds and rubies, 
---
I don't know. 
---
I started to do that, 
---
but I didn't know 
---
if I could put it back together. 
---
You take something apart you
---
should know how to put it back together. 
---
Seventeen jewels! 
---
And I can't get five dollars for it.
---
I'll let you have it for three dollars.
---
## WOLF:
I can't use it.
---
## STERLING: 
Three dollars?
---
That's alright, 
---
I'm gonna keep it. 
---
I'm gonna keep it 
---
till it stop ticking. 
---
Whenever you see me 
---
I'm gonna have on this watch.
---
## WOLF:
Well, let me get on 
---
and make my day. 
---
I'll see you all later. 
---
Hey, Risa keep smiling, baby.
---
## STERLING: 
They got so many people lined up 
---
across the street 
---
I thought it was the surplus food line. 
---
I'm gonna go over 
---
and get in line with everybody else. 
---
Get my luck changed.
---
You believe in luck? 
---
I was born with it. 
---
I was born with seven cents. 
---
My mama swallowed a nickel 
---
and two pennies 
---
and I come out 
---
with the nickel in one hand 
---
and the two pennies in the other. 
---
They say I was born with luck 
---
but they didn't say what kind. 
---
I think it was bad luck. 
---
What you think?
---
Say, baby, 
---
give me another cup of coffee.
---
You been over there to see Prophet Samuel?
---
## HOLLOWAY:
Yeah, I done seen him.
---
## STERLING:
I was over there 
---
talking to one man 
---
he say if you rub his head 
---
you get good luck. 
---
One man found twenty dollars 
---
on the sidewalk on his way out. 
---
I'm going over there. 
---
Might go through the line twice. 
---
Have double luck. 
---
That might not even be enough 
---
the way things is going. 
---
Might have to go through there three times.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
These niggers lining up over there 
---
to rub Prophet Samuel's head 
---
cause they think that's gonna
---
make their hand itch 
---
and they gonna get some money.
---
They don't know to go see Aunt Ester. 
---
Aunt Ester give you more than money. 
---
She make you right with yourself.
---
You ain't got to go far. 
---
She live at eighteen thirty-nine
Wylie. 
---
In the back. 
---
Go up there and you'll see a red
door. 
---
Go up there and knock on that.
---
## HAMBONE: 
I want my ham. 
---
I want my ham.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
Aunt Ester got a power 
---
cause she got an understanding. 
---
Anybody live as long as she has 
---
is bound to have an understanding.
---
## HAMBONE:
He gonna give me my ham. 
---
I want my ham.
---
## STERLING:
Somebody got his ham.
---
Who got your ham, man? 
---
Somebody took your ham?
---
## HOLLOWAY:
He talking about Lutz across the street. 
---
He painted his fence for him 
---
nine almost ten years ago,
---
and Lutz told him he'd give him a ham. 
---
After he painted the fence 
---
Lutz told him to take a chicken. 
---
He say he wanted his ham. 
---
Lutz told him to take a chicken 
---
or don't take nothing. 
---
So he wait over there every morning 
---
till Lutz come to open his store 
---
and he tell him he wants his ham. 
---
He ain't got it yet.
---
## MEMPHIS:
That ain't how it went. 
---
Lutz told him 
---
if he painted his fence 
---
he'd give him a' chicken. 
---
Told him if he do a good job 
---
he'd give him a ham. 
---
He think he did a good job 
---
and Lutz didn't. 
---
That's where he went wrong
---
letting Lutz decide what to pay him 
---
for his work. 
---
If you leave it like that, 
---
quite naturally 
---
he gonna say it ain't worth 
---
the higher price.
---
## HAMBONE:
He gonna give me my ham. 
---
He gonna give me my ham. 
---
I want my ham.
---
## MEMPHIS: 
Alright! 
---
I told you that's enough of that!
---
## HAMBONE: 
He gonna give me my ham. 
---
He gonna give me my ham.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
All he got to do is go see Aunt Ester. 
---
Aunt Ester could straighten him out. 
---
Don't care whatever your problem. 
---
She can straighten it out.
---
## STERLING:
You think she can help me find a job? 
---
I wanna open me up a nightclub.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
Whatever your problem is. 
---
It don't make no difference to Aunt Ester. 
---
She can help you with anything.
---
## STERLING:
Where she live at? 
---
What's that address again?
---
## HOLLOWAY:
Eighteen thirty-nine Wylie. 
---
In the back.
---
Knock on the red door. 
---
You can't miss it. 
---
Don't care who answer. 
---
Just say you come to see Aunt Ester. 
---
You ain't got to tell them 
---
what you want to see her about.
---
Just say, 
---
"I come to see Aunt Ester." 
---
You got to pay her, though. 
---
She won't take no money herself. 
---
She telt you to go down 
---
and throw it into the river. 
---
Say it'll come to her. 
---
She must be telling the truth, 
---
cause she don't want for nothing. 
---
She got some people there 
---
to take care of her 
---
and they don't want for nothing either.
---
## MEMPHIS:
Ask her how old she is while you up there.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
She'll tell you. 
---
She don't try to hide it. 
---
And she don't care if you believe or not. 
---
She three hundred and twenty-two years old. 
---
She'll tell you.
---
## MEMPHIS:
How the hell somebody gonna live 
---
to be three hundred 
---
and twenty-two years old, nigger? 
---
You talk like a fool.
---
## STERLING:
They lived that long in the Bible. 
---
I ain't surprised to hear that. 
---
Do she look like she come out the Bible?
---
## HOLLOWAY:
You got to go see 
---
what she look like for yourself. 
---
I'm just telling you 
---
she three hundred and twenty-two years old. 
---
Go on up there and see her. 
---
I go up to see her every once in a while. 
---
Get my soul washed. 
---
She don't do nothing but lay her hands on your head. 
---
But it's a feeling like you ain't never had before. 
---
Then every-thing in your life 
---
get real calm and peaceful.
---
## MEMPHIS:
I'd rather believe 
---
if I rubbed Prophet Samuel's head 
---
I'd get rich. 
---
That make more sense to me 
---
than to talk about somebody 
---
being three hundred and twenty-
two years old.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
She look like she five hundred. 
---
You be surprised when she say she ain't 
---
but three hundred and twenty-two. 
---
Don't ask me how she lived that long. 
---
I don't know. 
---
Look like death scared of her. 
---
Every time he come around her 
---
he just get up and get on away. 
---
Ask West about her. 
---
He'll tell you. 
---
He done went up there to see her. 
---
He been waiting to bury her 
---
since he saw her. 
---
Even told the people there in the house 
---
that he'd do it for free.
---
## MEMPHIS:
I ain't seen her change nobody's luck. 
---
Every nigger I know got bad luck. 
---
If it was easy as that
---
hell, we'd all be rich.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
See? 
---
There you go talking about being rich.
---
I ain't talking about that. 
---
I ain't said nothing about get-
ting rich. 
---
I'm talking about getting your luck changed.
---
You go up there 
---
with the wrong attitude 
---
and come out with worse luck 
---
than you had before. 
---
That's what the problem is now. 
---
Aunt Ester don't buy into that. 
---
She don't make people rich. 
---
You go up there talking about
---
you wanna get rich 
---
and she won't have nothing to do with you. 
---
She send you to see Prophet Samuel 
---
and you see how far that'll get you. 
---
Most people don't know
---
Prophet Samuel went to see Aunt Ester. 
---
He wasn't always a prophet. 
---
He started out he was a reverend. 
---
Had him a truck, 
---
and he'd stand on the back of that truck 
---
had him a loudspeaker, 
---
and he'd go out and preach
---
the word of the gospel 
---
and sell barbecue on the side.
---
Everybody knew Reverend Samuel. 
---
He even went out 
---
where the white folks lived 
---
and tried to preach to them.
---
They seen him with that truck 
---
and thought he come out
---
there to steal their furniture. 
---
Called the police on him.
---
Many a time. 
---
He go on 
---
and pay his fifty-dollar fine 
---
for preaching without a permit 
---
and go on back out here.
---
They had him in big trouble one time. 
---
He had all his money 
---
going to his church 
---
and they arrested him 
---
for income-tax evasion. 
---
That's when he went to see Aunt
Ester. 
---
He walked in there a reverend 
---
and walked out a prophet. 
---
I don't know what she told him. 
---
But he went down to see the mayor. 
---
Say if they arrested him 
---
they had to arrest Mellon too. 
---
Say God was gonna send a sign. 
---
The next day 
---
the stock market fell so fast 
---
they had to close it early. 
---
Mellon called the mayor 
---
and told him to drop the charges. 
---
The next day the stock market 
---
went right on back up there. 
---
Except for Gulf Oil, 
---
which Mellon owned. 
---
That went higher than it ever went before.
---
Mellon was tickled pink. 
---
He sent Prophet Samuel 
---
a five- hundred-dollar donation 
---
and a brochure advertising 
---
his banking services. 
---
Had his picture taken with him 
---
and everything. 
---
That's when Prophet Samuel went big. 
---
The police didn't bother him no more. 
---
Wouldn't even give him a parking ticket. 
---
If he hadn't started walking around
---
in them robes going barefoot and whatnot 
---
ain't no telling how big he would have got. 
---
A lot of people didn't like him 
---
wearing them robes 
---
baptizing people in the river 
---
and all that kinda stuff.
---
## MEMPHIS:
That's the damnedest thing I ever heard of.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
Don't take my word for it. 
---
Go on up there
---
and see for yourself. 
---
Go knock on the door. 
---
You don't have to be scared.
---
## MEMPHIS:
I ain't scared. 
---
What I got to be scared of? 
---
I just don't believe all that stuff.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
Ask West when you see him. 
---
Ask anybody that's been up there.
---
## STERLING:
You can ask me when I come back. 
---
Eighteen thirty-nine Wylie? 
---
In the back?
---
## HOLLOWAY:
Knock on the red door. 
---
Just say you come to see Aunt Ester. 
---
She'll straighten you out.
---
## STERLING:
Say, Risa, 
---
cook me up some chicken. 
---
I'll be back. 
---
I wanna eat what you been eating. 
---
See if I can get nice and healthy too.
---
## MEMPHIS:
That boy ain't got good sense.
---
## WOLF:
Here he come now. 
---
Lutz coming down the street.
---
Hambone standing there.
---
## MEMPHIS:
What's Holloway doing?
---
## WOLF:
He watching him. 
---
He just standing there. 
---
He wanna hear what they say. 
---
Look at him 
---
look at him. 
---
Look at Hambone.
---
## RISA: 
What you all looking at?
---
## WOLF:
We watching Hambone. 
---
We want to see what he say to Lutz. 
---
Holloway went over there 
---
to stand on the corner. 
---
Hambone talking to Lutz now.
---
## MEMPHIS:
That's the damnedest thing I ever seen.
---
Risa, you been here for a half an hour 
---
and ain't got the coffee on. 
---
What you doing back there? 
---
Get them grits cooked up. 
---
I told you 
---
put the bread in the refrigerator
---
keep it fresh.
---
## WOLF:
Lutz going in his store. 
---
He turned his back to him
---
and opening up his store. 
---
Holloway still standing there.
---
Lutz ought to go on and give him a ham.
---
## MEMPHIS:
Lutz ain't gonna give him no ham 
---
cause he don't feel he owe him. 
---
I wouldn't give him one either.
---
## WOLF:
After all this time 
---
it don't make no difference. 
---
He ought to go on 
---
and give him a ham. 
---
What difference do it make? 
---
It ain't like he ain't got none. 
---
Got a whole store full of hams.

## MEMPHIS:
What'd you do with that flour? 
---
Ain't even got the oven turned on. 
---
How you gonna cook biscuits 
---
with-out turning on the oven? 
---
Where the flour? 
---
I brought ten pound of flour 
---
in here yesterday.
---
## RISA:
It's in the back.
---
## MEMPHIS:
Here's the sifter. 
---
Sift the baking soda 
---
and flour together. 
---
You ain't used this sifter in a month. 
---
And get on up to the bakery 
---
and get West his pie 
---
before he get over here.
---
## WOLF:
I hear tell somebody 
---
tried to break in West's 
---
last night 
---
to steal Prophet Samuel's 
---
money and jewels. 
---
Set off the burglar alarm 
---
woke West up.
---
Hey, Holloway, 
---
we was watching you. 
---
What Hambone say?
---
We seen Lutz 
---
when he come down the street. 
---
What he say?
---
## HOLLOWAY:
He told him he wanted his ham, 
---
that's all.
---
Said, "I want my ham." 
---
Lutz told him, 
---
"Take a chicken," 
---
then he went on in his store. 
---
That was it. 
---
He ain't said nothing back to him. 
---
The only words exchanged was 
---
"I want my ham," 
---
and "Take a chicken."
---
## MEMPHIS:
I would just like to know 
---
after nine and a half years 
---
am I right, Holloway? 
---
after nine and a half years 
---
every day I wish my arithmetic 
---
was right to tell you 
---
how many days that is 
---
nine and a half years 
---
every day how in his right mind
---
do he think Lutz is gonna give him his ham? 
---
You answer me that. 
---
That's all I want to know.
---
## WOLF:
Anybody can see he ain't in his right mind.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
I don't know. 
---
He might be more in his right mind
---
than you are. 
---
He might have more sense 
---
than any of us.
---
## WOLF:
Would you stand over there 
---
every morning 
---
for nine and a half years?
---
## HOLLOWAY:
I ain't saying that. 
---
Naw hell, no 
---
I wouldn't stand over there 
---
for nine and a half years. 
---
But maybe I ain't got as much sense 
---
as he got.
---
## MEMPHIS:
You tell me how that make sense. 
---
You tell me what sense that make?
---
## HOLLOWAY:
Alright. 
---
I'll tell you. 
---
Now you take me or you. 
---
We ain't gonna do that. 
---
We gonna go ahead and forget about it. 
---
We might take a chicken. 
---
Then we gonna go home 
---
and cook that chicken. 
---
But how it gonna taste?
---
It can't taste good to us. 
---
We gonna be eating 
---
just to be eating. 
---
How we gonna feel good about ourselves? 
---
Every time we even look at a chicken 
---
we gonna have a bad taste in our mouth. 
---
That chicken's gonna call up that
taste. 
---
It's gonna make you feel ashamed. 
---
Even if it be walking around 
---
flapping its wings 
---
it's gonna remind us
---
of that bad taste. 
---
We ain't gonna tell nobody about it.
---
We don't want nobody to know. 
---
But you can't erase it.
---
You got to carry it around with you. 
---
This fellow here
---
he say he don't want to carry it 
---
around with him.
---
But he ain't willing to forget about it. 
---
He trying to put the shame 
---
on the other foot. 
---
He trying to shame Lutz 
---
into giving him his ham. 
---
And if Lutz ever break down
---
and give it to him 
---
he gonna have a big thing. 
---
He gonna have something 
---
he be proud to tell everybody.
---
He gonna tell his grandkids 
---
if he have any. 
---
That's why I say 
---
he might have more sense 
---
than me and you. 
---
Cause he ain't willing to accept 
---
whatever the white man throw
at him. 
---
It be easier. 
---
But he say he don't mind 
---
getting out of the bed in the morning 
---
to go at what's right. 
---
I don't believe you and me 
---
got that much sense.
---
## MEMPHIS:
That's that old backward southern mentality.
---
When I come up here 
---
they had to teach these niggers 
---
they didn't have to tip their hat 
---
to a white man. 
---
They walking around here 
---
tipping their hat, 
---
jumping off the sidewalk,
---
talking about 
---
"Yessir, Captain," 
---
"How do, Major."
---
## WOLF:
How long you been up here, Memphis?
---
## MEMPHIS:
I been up here since '36. 
---
They ran me out of Jackson in '31. 
---
I hung around Natchez 
---
for three or four years, 
---
then I come up here. 
---
I was born in Jackson. 
---
I used to farm down there. 
---
They ran me out in '31. 
---
Killed my mule and everything. 
---
One of these days 
---
I'm going back and get my land. 
---
I still got the deed.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
I got an uncle 
---
and a bunch of cousins 
---
down in Jackson.
---
## MEMPHIS:
When I left out of Jackson 
---
I said I was gonna buy me 
---
a V-8 Ford 
---
and drive by Mr. Henry Ford's house
---
and honk the horn. 
---
If anybody come to the window 
---
I was gonna wave. 
---
Then I was going out 
---
and buy me a 30.06, 
---
come on back to Jackson 
---
and drive up to Mr. Stovall's house 
---
and honk the horn. 
---
Only this time I wasn't waving. 
---
Only thing was, 
---
it took me thirteen years 
---
to get the Ford. 
---
Six years later 
---
I traded that in on a Cadillac. 
---
But I'm going back one of these days. 
---
I ain't even got to know the way. 
---
All I got to do is find my way down 
---
to the train depot. 
---
They got two trains running 
---
every day. 
---
I used to know the schedule. 
---
They might have changed it
---
but if they did, 
---
they got it posted up on the board.
---
## RISA:
The oven's on. 
---
I'm going to get the pie.
---
## MEMPHIS:
A man would be happy 
---
to have a woman like that 
---
except she done ruined herself. 
---
She ain't right with herself 
---
how she gonna be right with you? 
---
Anybody take a razor 
---
and cut up on herself ain't right. 
---
If she cut her legs 
---
she might cut your throat. 
---
That's the way I see it. 
---
Other than that, 
---
any man be glad 
---
to lay up next to that every night. 
---
Something ain't right with a woman
---
don't want no man. 
---
That ain't natural. 
---
If she say she like women 
---
that be another thing. 
---
It ain't natural, 
---
but that be something else. 
---
But somebody that's 
---
all confused about herself 
---
and don't want nobody 
---
I can't figure out where to put her.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
That's what the problem is 
---
you trying to figure out 
---
where to put her. 
---
I know Risa. 
---
She one of them gals 
---
that matured quick. 
---
And every man that seen her
---
since she was twelve years old 
---
think she ought to go 
---
lay up with them somewhere. 
---
She don't want that. 
---
She figure 
---
if she made her legs ugly 
---
that would force everybody 
---
to look at her 
---
and see what kind of 
---
personality she is.
---
## MEMPHIS:
She a mixed-up personality. 
---
Anybody can see that. 
---
That plain to see. 
---
Who want a woman 
---
after she done that to herself? 
---
I don't want her. 
---
I don't know what she might do to me.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
They had her 
---
down there at Western Psych.
---
They couldn't find 
---
nothing wrong with her. 
---
They tried every kind of counselor 
---
they could think of.
---
## WOLF:
She don't need no counselor. 
---
Ain't nothing wrong with Risa. 
---
All she need is a good man. 
---
Trust me, I know Risa.
---
## MEMPHIS:
You don't know her 
---
like you want to know her.
---
Don't nobody know her.
---
## WOLF:
I know Risa better 
---
than people think I do. 
---
That's what I'm trying to say. 
---
I know all she need is a man.
---
Somebody to make her feel like a woman. 
---
She ain't had that in six years 
---
that I know of. 
---
Common sense say 
---
after six years she need a man. 
---
I see where that Sterling be
eyeing her. 
---
He be after her. 
---
But he don't know Risa.
---
He don't know her like I know her. 
---
Maybe he a better man than me. 
---
I don't know. 
---
But if I had to say, 
---
I don't think so. 
---
You want anything, Memphis?
---
## MEMPHIS:
Give me a dollar on four twenty-one.
---
## WOLF:
Holloway?
---
## HOLLOWAY:
I'm gonna wait till 
---
I get me a good dream. 
---
I can't dream about nothing.
---
## WOLF:
I'll catch you all later.
---
## MEMPHIS:
Hey, Holloway, 
---
you know what I just found out? 
---
You know who that boy is 
---
that Sterling boy?
---
I was talking to Hendricks. 
---
That's the boy robbed that bank 
---
and was out spending the money 
---
ten minutes later. 
---
You remember that? 
---
Hendricks give him a job 
---
to help him get out 
---
and the boy worked one week 
---
and quit.
---
See, Hendricks don't know 
---
he don't know like I know.
---
He trying to help him, 
---
but that boy don't wanna work.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
He say Hendricks laid him off. 
---
But I can't blame him 
---
if he did quit. 
---
Who wanna haul bricks 
---
on a construction site 
---
for a dollar and a quarter an hour? 
---
That ain't gonna help him. 
---
What's he gonna do 
---
with ten dollars a day?
---
## MEMPHIS:
That be ten more 
---
than he got now. 
---
His grandaddy used to work 
---
for three dollars a day. 
---
He doing good!
---
## HOLLOWAY:
I ain't talking about that. 
---
Hell, his great-grandaddy 
---
used to work for nothing, 
---
for all that matter.
---
I'm talking about 
---
he can make two or three hundred
---
dollars a day gambling 
---
if he get lucky. 
---
If he don't, somebody else will get it. 
---
That's all you got around here
---
is niggers with somebody else's 
---
money in their pocket.
---
And they don't do nothing 
---
but trade it off on each other.
---
I got it today 
---
and you got it tomorrow. 
---
Until sooner or later 
---
as sure as the sun shine 
---
somebody gonna take it 
---
and give it to the white man. 
---
The money go from you to me 
---
to you and then bingo, 
---
it's gone. 
---
From him to you to me, 
---
then bingo, it's gone. 
---
You give it to the white man. 
---
Pay your rent, 
---
pay your telephone, 
---
buy your groceries, 
---
see the doctor bingo, 
---
it's gone. 
---
Just circulate it around 
---
till it find that hole, 
---
then bingo. 
---
Like trying to haul sand 
---
in a bucket with a hole in it. 
---
Time you get where you going 
---
the bucket empty. 
---
That's why that ten dollars a day 
---
ain't gonna do him no good. 
---
A nigger with five hundred dollars 
---
in his pocket around here 
---
is a big man. 
---
But you go out there 
---
where they at you go
---
out to Squirrel Hill, 
---
they walking around there 
---
with five thousand dollars 
---
in their pocket 
---
trying to figure out 
---
how to make it into 
---
five hundred thousand.
---
## MEMPHIS:
Ain't nothing wrong 
---
in saving your money 
---
and do like they do. 
---
These niggers just don't want to work.
---
That boy don't want to work. 
---
He lazy.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
People kill me 
---
talking about niggers is lazy.
---
Niggers is the most 
---
hard-working people in the world.
---
Worked three hundred years 
---
for free. 
---
And didn't take no lunch hour. 
---
Now all of a sudden 
---
niggers is lazy. 
---
Don't know how to work. 
---
All of a sudden 
---
when they got to pay niggers, 
---
ain't no work for him to do. 
---
If it wasn't for you 
---
the white man would be poor. 
---
Every little bit he got
---
he got standing on top of you. 
---
That's why he could reach so high. 
---
He give you three dollars a day 
---
for six months
---
and he got him a railroad 
---
for the next hundred years.
---
All you got is six months' worth 
---
of three dollars a day.
---
Now you can't even get that. 
---
Ain't no money in niggers working. 
---
Look out there on the street. 
---
If there was some money in it 
---
if the white man could figure out 
---
a way to make some money 
---
by putting niggers to work
---
we'd all be working. 
---
He ain't building no more railroads.
---
He got them. 
---
He ain't building no more highways. 
---
Somebody done already stuck 
---
the telephone poles in the ground. 
---
That's been done already. 
---
The white man ain't stacking 
---
no more niggers. 
---
You know what I'm talking about, 
---
stacking niggers, don't you? 
---
Well, here's how that go. 
---
If you ain't got nothing 
---
you can go out here 
---
and get you a nigger. 
---
Then you got something, see. 
---
You got one nigger. 
---
If that one nigger get out there 
---
and plant something 
---
get something out the ground 
---
even if it ain't nothing 
---
but a bushel of potatoes 
---
then you got one nigger 
---
and one bushel of potatoes. 
---
Then you take that bushel of potatoes 
---
and go get you another nigger. 
---
Then you got two niggers. 
---
Put them to work 
---
and you got two niggers 
---
and two bushels of potatoes. 
---
See, now you can go 
---
buy two more niggers. 
---
That's how you stack a nigger 
---
on top of a nigger. 
---
White folks got to stacking 
---
and I'm talking about 
---
they stacked up some niggers! 
---
Stacked up close to fifty million niggers. 
---
If you stacked them on top 
---
of one another 
---
they make six or seven 
---
circles around the moon. 
---
It's lucky the boat didn't sink 
---
with all them niggers 
---
they had stacked up there. 
---
It take them two extra months 
---
to get here 
---
cause it ride so low in the water. 
---
They couldn't find you 
---
enough work back then. 
---
Now that they got to pay you 
---
they can't find you none. 
---
If this was different time 
---
wouldn't be nobody out there on the street. 
---
They'd all be in the cotton fields.
---
## MEMPHIS:
I still say that boy 
---
don't want to work.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
Hey, West.
---
## WEST:
Hey, Risa.
---
## RISA:
How you doing, Mr. West?
---
## WEST:
Let me get 
---
a little bit of sugar here, Risa.
---
## MEMPHIS:
I see they lined up out there.
---
## WEST:
Yeah, 
---
I finally got him laid out 
---
like they wanted
---
and the people over there 
---
trying to rub his head. 
---
I got it roped off, 
---
but they duck right under the rope 
---
talking about they didn't see it.
---
## MEMPHIS:
I ain't been over there yet, 
---
but Holloway say
---
they got all kind of jewels 
---
and hundred-dollar bills 
---
in the casket with him.
---
## WEST:
I don't know how that got started. 
---
The man ain't got nothing but 
---
a couple of rings, 
---
that gold cross he wear, 
---
and two hundred-dollar bills. 
---
Got one in his breast pocket 
---
and one wrapped around his finger 
---
tucked and glued in his hand.
---
## MEMPHIS:
You ain't glued the man's money 
---
in his hand.
---
## WEST:
Yeah, I did. 
---
I done learned in this business. 
---
I can't tell you 
---
how many rings 
---
and watches 
---
and whatnot 
---
have disappeared.
---
## MEMPHIS:
I know you ain't gonna 
---
put that money in the ground.
---
## WEST:
I'll bury anything with anybody. 
---
You be surprised what people want 
---
in the casket with them. 
---
I done buriedpeople with Bibles, 
---
canes, crutches, guitars, 
---
radios, baby dolls. 
---
One lady brought some tomatoes 
---
from her sister's garden. 
---
She didn't just want me to put them in there. 
---
She wanted to tell me where to put them. 
---
That wouldn't have been so bad, 
---
but she kept changing her mind. 
---
People's something. 
---
They don't understand about
dead folks. 
---
Dead folks don't know nothing. 
---
They don't know them tomatoes 
---
is in there with them. 
---
But the family know. 
---
That's who it's important to. 
---
It took me a while to figure that out. 
---
But I don't mind putting anything
---
in there with anybody 
---
as long as the casket close.
---
## MEMPHIS:
Is you gonna put that money in the ground?
---
That's what I wanna know.
---
## WEST:
Most times the family come 
---
and get the money 
---
before you close the casket. 
---
Take off their rings 
---
and everything else. 
---
I hate to even lay people out 
---
with jewelry cause the family 
---
come and remind you every day 
---
that it ain't supposed to 
---
go in the ground.
---
## MEMPHIS:
Holloway say they was over there 
---
taking up a collection. 
---
Say they was charging the people 
---
to see him.
---
## WEST:
I put a stop to that. 
---
I don't allow 
---
that kind of thing over there. 
---
I stopped them from doing that. 
---
What they say to you downtown there?
---
## MEMPHIS:
I ain't went yet. 
---
I got to go down there tomorrow. 
---
I'm going down there 
---
and see what they offer me for it. 
---
I ain't taking a penny less 
---
than twenty-five thousand dollars.
---
## WEST:
They ain't gonna give you 
---
no twenty-five thousand dollars 
---
for this building. 
---
It ain't worth that. 
---
They look up what you paid for it 
---
and double that. 
---
That's one hundred percent profit. 
---
They figure anybody 
---
be satisfied with that. 
---
It's hard to argue against that. 
---
The lawyer can't even 
---
argue against that. 
---
They ain't gonna give you 
---
but ten eleven thousand. 
---
Twelve at the most.
---
## MEMPHIS:
I ain't taking a penny less 
---
than twenty-five thousand.
---
## WEST:
They ain't gonna give you 
---
no twenty-five thousand dollars 
---
on something they gonna tear down! 
---
I don't know how 
---
niggers think sometimes. 
---
Now, I told you I'd give you 
---
fifteen thousand dollars for it. 
---
Cash money. 
---
We can go down to the bank 
---
right now. 
---
Fifteen thousand dollars.
---
Draw it right out in cash. 
---
You can get it any way you want. 
---
Hundreds. 
---
Twenties.
---
## MEMPHIS:
Naw. Naw. 
---
I ain't taking a penny less 
---
than twenty-five thousand dollars.
---
## WEST:
You watch and see 
---
what I'm telling you. 
---
They gonna double what you paid for it. 
---
They ain't gonna give you
---
no ten thousand dollars on top of that.
---
## MEMPHIS:
Then they ain't getting my building. 
---
I figure that twenty-five thousand 
---
is cheap. 
---
They forcing me to move out 
---
close up my business 
---
well, I figure they ought to 
---
pay something for that. 
---
I don't care what the building is worth 
---
or how much I bought it for.
---
## WEST:
They got the right 
---
of eminent domain. 
---
They don't care what you think. 
---
They can go anywhere in the city
---
and take any piece of property they want. 
---
The city council done voted 
---
to take over these whole twelve blocks.
---
They getting five this year 
---
and seven next year. 
---
They ain't gonna let you 
---
stand in their way. 
---
Talk to Philmore down the street. 
---
He sold me his place.
---
He know the city wasn't gonna 
---
give him what it's worth.
---
## MEMPHIS:
Give me twenty-five thousand dollars 
---
and you can have it. 
---
Put it with your other property 
---
and go down there and get fifty for it.
---
## WEST:
I told you I'd give you fifteen. 
---
It ain't worth no twenty-five. 
---
To me or nobody else.
---
## MEMPHIS:
I ain't taking a penny less 
---
than twenty-five thousand dollars.
---
## WEST:
Alright. 
---
You gonna be surprised. 
---
Don't say I didn't warn you. 
---
Let me know if you change your
mind. 
---
We can go right on down to the bank 
---
any time you want.
---
## MEMPHIS:
You hear that, Holloway? 
---
The man own so much property 
---
around here 
---
the city gonna go broke 
---
trying to pay him for it 
---
and he trying to hustle me. 
---
Hell, if he offer me fifteen for it 
---
I know it's worth twenty-five.
---
Might be able to get thirty.
---
## STERLING:
How you all doing? 
---
Hey, Risa, 
---
let me get a cup of coffee.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
Did you go up there 
---
to see Aunt Ester?
---
## STERLING:
I went up there. 
---
Got a red door just like you
say. 
---
I knocked on the door. 
---
I must have knocked on it 
---
about five minutes. 
---
I was getting ready to leave 
---
when a man opened the door. 
---
Big man. 
---
Must have been over seven feet tall. 
---
I told him I wanted to see Aunt Ester
---
and he told me she was sick.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
She get sick sometime. 
---
As you can imagine
---
somebody three hundred 
---
and twenty-two years old 
---
is bound to get sick once in a while. 
---
But she ain't gonna die, 
---
I guarantee you that! 
---
You go on back up there next
week.
---
## MEMPHIS:
Ain't nobody up there. 
---
I take that back
---
there might be somebody up there 
---
but she ain't no 
---
three hundred years old.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
Three hundred and twenty-two. 
---
If you gonna tell it 
---
tell it right. 
---
Three hundred and twenty-two.
---
## STERLING:
You all wanna go to this rally. 
---
They having a rally 
---
to celebrate Malcolm X's birthday. 
---
It's right down there 
---
at the Savoy Ballroom.
---
Here you go, Risa.
---
## MEMPHIS:
Malcolm X is dead. 
---
Malcolm ain't having no more birthdays. 
---
Dead men don't have birthdays. 
---
I'd rather celebrate your birthday. 
---
I'll buy the cake, 
---
'a case of liquor, 
---
and we can have a party. 
---
I ain't going to no party 
---
for no dead man.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
I remember when Malcolm 
---
didn't have but twelve followers. 
---
I remember when he come out 
---
to the Mosque there. 
---
I went out and saw him. 
---
He didn't have but twelve followers.
---
## STERLING:
Why wasn't you number thirteen?
---
## MEMPHIS:
Where he gonna follow him to? 
---
The only place he was going 
---
was to the graveyard. 
---
Anybody could see that.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
I didn't follow him 
---
cause I know where to find 
---
Aunt Ester. 
---
If she hadn't been there 
---
I don't know what I would have done.
---
## STERLING:
I would have followed him. 
---
He the only one who told the truth. 
---
That's why they killed him.
---
## MEMPHIS:
Niggers killed Malcolm.
---
Niggers killed Malcolm.
---
When you want to talk about Malcolm, 
---
remember that first. 
---
Niggers killed Malcolm 
---
and now they want to 
---
celebrate his birthday.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
Malcolm got too big. 
---
People call him a saint.
---
That's what the problem was. 
---
He got too big, 
---
and when you get that big 
---
ain't nothing else you could do. 
---
They killed all the saints. 
---
Saint Peter. 
---
Saint Paul. 
---
They killed them all. 
---
When you get to be a saint 
---
there ain't nothing else 
---
you can do but die. 
---
The people wouldn't have it 
---
any other way.
---
## MEMPHIS:
You right about that. 
---
They killed Martin. 
---
If they did that to him 
---
you can imagine what they 
---
do to me or you.
---
If they kill the sheep 
---
you know what they do to the wolf.
---
## STERLING:
That's why they having the rally. 
---
They rallying for black power. 
---
Stop them from killing the sheep.
---
## MEMPHIS:
That's what half the problem is 
---
these black power niggers. 
---
They got people confused. 
---
They don't know what they doing themselves. 
---
These niggers talking about 
---
freedom, justice, and equality 
---
and don't know what it mean. 
---
You born free. 
---
It's up to you to maintain it. 
---
You born with dignity 
---
and everything else. 
---
These niggers talking about freedom, 
---
but what you gonna do with it? 
---
Freedom is heavy. 
---
You got to put your shoulder to
freedom. 
---
Put your shoulder to it 
---
and hope your back hold up. 
---
And if you around here 
---
looking for justice, 
---
you got a long wait. 
---
Ain't no justice. 
---
That's why they got that statue 
---
of her and got her blindfolded. 
---
Common sense would tell you 
---
if anybody need to see she do.
---
There ain't no justice. 
---
Jesus Christ didn't get justice.
---
What makes you think you gonna get it? 
---
That's just the nature 
---
of the world. 
---
These niggers 
---
talking about they want,
---
freedom, justice, and equality. 
---
Equal to what?
---
Hell, I might be 
---
a better man than you. 
---
What I look like
---
going around here talking about 
---
I want to be equal to you? 
---
I don't know how 
---
these niggers think sometimes.
---
Talking about black power 
---
with their hands 
---
and their pockets empty. 
---
You can't do nothing without a gun. 
---
Not in this day and time. 
---
That's the only kind of power 
---
the white man understand. 
---
They think they gonna 
---
talk their way up on it. 
---
In order to talk your way 
---
you got to have something 
---
under the table. 
---
These niggers don't understand that. 
---
If I tell you to get out my yard 
---
and leave my apples alone, 
---
I can't talk you out. 
---
You sit up in the tree
---
and laugh at me. 
---
But if you know I might come out 
---
with a shotgun 
---
that be something different. 
---
You'd have to think twice 
---
about whether you wanted some apples.
---
These niggers around here talking 
---
about they black and beautiful. 
---
Sound like they trying to convince them-selves. 
---
You got to think you ugly 
---
to run around shouting you beautiful. 
---
You don't hear me say that. 
---
Hell, I know I look nice. 
---
Got good manners and everything.
---
## STERLING:
Well, it say, 
---
"Come one, come all." 
---
You supposed to be there 
---
when it say that. 
---
But that's alright if you don't go, 
---
it ain't gonna stop the show.
---
## HAMBONE:
He gonna give me my ham. 
---
He gonna give me my ham.
---
## MEMPHIS:
Naw. Naw. 
---
Take that on out of here. 
---
Risa, don't give him nothing. 
---
Go on, take that somewhere else.
---
## HAMBONE:
He gonna give me my ham. 
---
He gonna give me my ham.
---
## MEMPHIS:
I don't wanna hear that today. 
---
Go on out of here with that.
---
## RISA:
Here's your coffee, Hambone.
---
## MEMPHIS:
I told you not to give him nothing.
---
## RISA:
He ain't bothering nobody.
---
## MEMPHIS:
Let him take that somewhere else.
---
## RISA:
He ain't bothering nobody, Memphis. 
---
He just come in to get his coffee.
---
## HAMBONE: 
He gonna give me my ham.
---
## MEMPHIS: 
Go on over there and get it.
---
## HAMBONE:
I want my ham!
---
## MEMPHIS: 
There he is. 
---
Go on over there.
---
Come in here 
---
running off at the mouth. 
---
I'm tired of hearing that.
---
## RISA:
He don't bother nobody.
---
## MEMPHIS:
He bother me. 
---
Let him go on over there 
---
and get his ham. 
---
It ain't like Lutz hiding from him. 
---
That man crazy. 
---
He let Lutz drive him crazy. 
---
Well, go on over there 
---
with Lutz and tell him. 
---
Don't tell me. 
---
Man been around here ten years 
---
talking the same thing. 
---
I'm tired of hearing it.
---
## STERLING:
Say, Risa, 
---
what you put in these beans? 
---
You must have stuck your finger 
---
in there or something. 
---
Give me another bowl. 
---
Give me a couple of them muffins too.
---
I went up to see Boykins 
---
about a job. 
---
He say he don't need nobody. 
---
He told me to go over to the steel mill.
---
He don't know they got a waiting list.
---
## RISA:
Everybody got a waiting list.
---
## STERLING:
I saw Hambone. 
---
I was trying to talk to him.
---
We got us a thing going.
---
## RISA:
Most people 
---
don't understand Hambone. 
---
That's cause they don't 
---
take the time. 
---
Most people think 
---
he can't understand nothing. 
---
But he understand everything
---
what's going on around him. 
---
Most of the time 
---
he understand better than they do.
---
## STERLING:
I seen Holloway 
---
a little while ago. 
---
He say he was going downtown to see 
---
about his social security. 
---
I didn't know he was that old. 
---
He say he was 
---
going down there and register.
---
## RISA:
He used to paint houses. 
---
Sometime he still do that.
---
Going up on people's roofs. 
--- 
I told him 
---
you'd never catch me going up there.
---
## STERLING:
I wouldn't go up 
---
lessen it was flat on top. 
---
Then I wouldn't mind none. 
---
Where Memphis?
---
## RISA:
He gone downtown 
---
to take care of his business. 
---
They gonna tear the building down.
---
## STERLING:
That don't surprise me. 
---
Ain't nothing hardly around here 
---
no more no way. 
---
They done tore the orphanage down. 
---
I was born an orphan. 
---
My mama gave me away to Mrs. Johnson. 
---
She died 
---
and they put me in an orphanage.
---
Down there at Toner Institute. 
---
I been on my own 
---
since I was eighteen. 
---
That's twelve years now. 
---
I made it pretty good so far. 
---
Except when I was 
---
in the penitentiary.
---
## RISA:
What you go to jail for?
---
## STERLING:
I robbed a bank. 
---
I was tired of waking up 
---
every day with no money. 
---
I figure a man 
---
supposed to have money sometime. 
---
Everybody else seem like they got it.
---
Seem like I'm the only one 
---
ain't got no money. 
---
I figure I'd get my money 
---
where Mellon get his from. 
---
That was after Mr. Lewis 
---
at the orphanage died. 
---
I never would want him to know 
---
I would do something like that. 
---
After he died 
---
I got kinda desperate. 
---
I just kept getting deeper
---
and deeper in a hole. 
---
Wolf say you put them scars
---
on your legs yourself. 
---
Wasn't you scared 
---
you was gonna bleed to death?
---
## RISA:
They didn't bleed that much.
---
## STERLING:
I be scared 
---
to do something like that. 
---
We had one boy 
---
down at the Toner Institute 
---
name of Eddie Langston 
---
I never will forget that. 
---
He cut his wrists
---
and bled to death.
---
We was about thirteen. 
---
I tried to wake him up 
---
in the morning 
---
and the whole bed 
---
was filled with blood. 
---
That stopped me from doing 
---
something like that. 
---
You wanna go to this rally with me? 
---
They having this rally for Malcolm X. 
---
You ought to come and go with
me. 
---
It right down there 
---
at the Savoy Ballroom. 
---
They might have some dancing. 
---
You like to dance?
---
## RISA:
If it be with the right person.
---
## STERLING:
I can't dance. 
---
I ain't never danced. 
---
I guess I could slow-dance. 
---
Seem like anybody can do that. 
---
That ain't but so much grinding. 
---
I can't fast-dance though. 
---
It seems kinda stupid 
---
to be moving around like that. 
---
Like you should know better 
---
than to make yourself look silly.
---
## RISA:
It ain't silly. 
---
You can't dance for real?
---
## STERLING:
I asked this girl one time 
---
and she said no. 
---
I ain't never asked nobody else. 
---
I started to one time.
---
Something told me not to. 
---
It was down at the workmen's
club. 
---
I went in there 
---
and seen this woman. 
---
She was dancing with some other guys. 
---
She was laughing 
---
and having her a good time. 
---
I started to ask her to dance 
---
and changed my mind. 
---
Then I just forgot about dancing for good.
---
## RISA:
You just didn't ask the right person.
---
## STERLING:
You ought to hang that 
---
announcement up there. 
---
Somebody might wanna go. 
---
It say, 
---
"Come one,come all." 
---
You ought to come and go with me.
---
## RISA:
I don't want to go down there 
---
with all them people.
---
I stay away from all 
---
that kind of stuff. 
---
You never see me hanging 
---
around a bunch of people.
---
## STERLING:
People don't pay you 
---
half as much mind 
---
as you think they do. 
---
That just be in your head. 
---
Most people so busy 
---
trying to live their own lives 
---
they ain't got time to pay 
---
attention to nobody else. 
---
I found that out. 
---
I used to think everybody cared 
---
what I did. 
---
I robbed that bank
---
and thought people would be 
---
mad at me. 
---
Half of them didn't even 
---
know I was gone. 
---
Five years 
---
and ain't nobody missed me. 
---
They didn't even think about me 
---
till they saw me again. 
---
You can go down there with me 
---
and won't nobody even notice.
---
## RISA: 
I don't care if they notice or not. 
---
I don't want to go down there 
---
with them niggers. 
---
There might be a riot or something.
---
## STERLING:
If a fight break out, 
---
you just get behind me. 
---
I won't let nobody hurt you. 
---
Not when you with me. 
---
I don't care if he was King Kong 
---
or Mighty Joe Young.
---
He got to come through me first. 
---
Mrs. Johnson taught me that. 
---
Told me not to let nobody 
---
hurt my sister. 
---
Say she'd rather see me hurt 
---
than her hurt. 
---
That made me kinda important. 
---
Made me feel strong. 
---
Like when I robbed the bank. 
---
That made me feel strong too. 
---
Like I had everything under control. 
---
I did until they arrested me.
---
## RISA:
I still ain't going down there.
---
## STERLING:
I can't find no job, 
---
I got to keep trying 
---
to hit the numbers. 
---
You play numbers?
---
## RISA:
I don't throw my money 
---
away like that.
---
## STERLING:
I know a lot of people 
---
play numbers. 
---
If you lucky 
---
you can do alright. 
---
I been trying to hit 
---
since I got out. 
---
I dreamt about dogs 
---
and looked it up 
---
in the dream book. 
---
That didn't work. 
---
I found a quarter 
---
on the fourth step of my house 
---
and played four twenty-five. 
---
That didn't work. 
---
Now I'm counting cars. 
---
I count all the Buicks I see 
---
and play that with all the 
---
Cadillacs and Fords I see. 
---
If I had a telephone number 
---
I'd play that.
---
## RISA:
I don't know why people 
---
throw their money away. 
---
That twenty-five cents you found 
---
is twenty-five cents 
---
you could have had. 
---
You could have played 
---
the jukebox or something.
---
## STERLING:
I'm trying to get 
---
twenty-five hundred dollars. 
---
I wouldn't mind taking a chance 
---
on that if I had me a good number.
---
## RISA:
Play seven eighty-one.
---
## STERLING:
How you come up with that?
---
## RISA:
I got seven scars on one leg 
---
and eight on the other.
---
## STERLING:
Where you get the one from?
---
## RISA:
That's my business.
---
## STERLING:
One what?
---
## RISA:
Go on, Sterling, 
---
I ain't playing with you.
---
## STERLING:
What? 
---
I just say, 
---
"Where you get the one from?" 
---
You getting all embarrassed. 
---
What you getting embarrassed about? 
---
I ought to play seven eighty-two.
---
We can put one and one together.
---
## RISA:
Go on, Sterling. 
---
You asked me for a number 
---
and I give you one now. 
---
If you want to play it 
---
go on and play it.
---
## STERLING:
I'm gonna put five dollars 
---
on that number seven eighty-one.  
---
Wait, let me see how much money I got.
---
I ain't got nothing right now, 
---
but as soon as I get me some money 
---
I'm gonna play that seven eighty-one. 
---
If it come out we gonna get married.
---
Hey, Holloway.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
Hey, Sterling. 
---
How you doing, Risa?
---
## STERLING:
Hey, Holloway, 
---
you talking about that fence
---
that run in back 
---
of Lutz's Meat Market 
---
where he put his garbage, 
---
back of that alley there, 
---
across from that bill-board 
---
above Eddie's Restaurant? 
---
Is that the fence Hambone painted?
---
## HOLLOWAY:
Yeah, that's it.
---
## STERLING:
That fence run all up the side 
---
and all the way around 
---
the back there. 
---
He ought to have give him 
---
two hams. 
---
I wouldn't paint that fence 
---
for no ham. 
---
He'd have to give me 
---
a case of chickens 
---
or one of them half-cows 
---
he got hanging over there. 
---
He'd have to give me 
---
something like that. 
---
That fence run all the way 
---
back around there.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
Used to have another part 
---
closer to the front,
---
but Lutz tore that down.
---
## STERLING:
I looked at it. 
---
He did a good job. 
---
Some of the paint done chipped off 
---
but you can tell 
---
he did a good job. 
---
I started to go over there 
---
and get his ham for him.
---
But then he wouldn't have nothing 
---
to do in the morning.
---
I didn't want to take that 
---
away from him. 
---
He have more cause to get up 
---
out of the bed in the morning 
---
than I do.
---
I consider him lucky. 
---
I get up cause I wake up 
---
and can't think of nothing else to do. 
---
Get up and see what's out here. 
---
Only it be the same thing as yesterday. 
---
I guess it be that for him, too. 
---
Only Lutz just might shock him 
---
to death one day and say, 
---
"Here, take your ham!" 
---
Best thing that might happen to me 
---
is I get a woman 
---
and an extra twenty dollars 
---
from somewhere. 
---
The jukebox still broke?
---
## RISA:
Yeah. 
---
They supposed to fix it. 
---
It ain't gonna do nothing 
---
but break again if they do fix it.
---
## STERLING:
I don't know why I want to play it. 
---
That's just like paying a quarter 
---
to hear yourself sing. 
---
You ought to get a radio or something. 
---
That's free.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
Let me get some sugar, Risa.
---
## STERLING:
How come you don't give nobody no sugar?
---
You make them ask for it.
---
## RISA:
I give it to them.
---
All they got to do is ask. 
---
West ask for sugar 
---
and then half the time 
---
don't use it. 
---
You watch him. 
---
First thing he do is ask for sugar 
---
and then it look like he change his mind.
---
## STERLING:
West got a sweet tooth. 
---
I'm surprised he don't use it. 
---
As much pie as he eat.
---
## WOLF:
How's everybody in here? 
---
Risa, here go some stockings. 
---
And put this cologne 
---
back over there for Memphis.
---
He like that English Leather cologne.
---
## RISA:
What size is they?
---
## WOLF:
They your size. 
---
I wouldn't be giving them to you
otherwise.
---
## RISA:
How much I owe you?
---
## WOLF:
You don't owe me nothing. 
---
If I come up with one of them 
---
fur coats we can sit down and talk. 
---
We can do some real nice negotiating.
---
## RISA:
I don't want no fur coat.
---
## WOLF:
You don't want none 
---
till you see it. 
---
After you put one of them on 
---
and see what it feel like 
---
then you want one.
---
## STERLING:
Hey, Wolf loan me two dollars. 
---
I wanna play a number. 
---
Me and Risa got something going. 
---
Luck might be trying 
---
to get in my door today. 
---
I need me some money 
---
to buy Risa a present.
---
## WOLF:
I ain't got it, Sterling.
---
## STERLING:
I'm gonna hit the numbers 
---
and buy Risa a present, 
---
then I'm gonna get me one of them 
---
Buick Electra deuce and a quarter.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
You need to be trying 
---
to find you a job.
---
## STERLING:
I been trying to get one. 
---
Ain't nobody got none. 
---
I wish I could get one of them 
---
white folks'jobs,
---
making eight or nine thousand 
---
dollars a year.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
You ain't got none of them 
---
white folks' education 
---
how you gonna get one of their jobs?
---
## STERLING:
Hey, I can do anything. 
---
I told the judge 
---
I could do his job. 
---
I got enough sense 
---
to sit up there 
---
and tell right from wrong. 
---
I can tell when somebody 
---
getting rail roaded when the 
---
lawyer is talking too much. 
---
I got sense enough to know when 
---
it's lunch time 
---
and how to say "recess." 
---
I can do anything 
---
the white man can do.
---
If the truth be told 
---
most things I can do better.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
I see where you gonna end up 
---
back down there.
---
## STERLING:
Not in this life. 
---
All I do is try 
---
to live in the world, 
---
but the world done gone crazy. 
---
I'm sorry I was ever born into it. 
---
This woman told me one time, 
---
"Sterling, I wanna have your baby." 
---
I told her if we have a baby 
---
he might live to be 
---
seventy-five years old. 
---
Just think how much hell 
---
he gonna catch. 
---
I wouldn't do that to nobody.
---
She told me I was crazy. 
---
Hell, maybe she was right. 
---
But nobody will ever come to me 
---
and say, 
---
"You responsible for this. 
---
You brought me into this crazy world."
---
## WOLF:
That's why I don't have no kids. 
---
I said the same thing.
---
## STERLING:
Hey, Wolf tell him 
---
what kind of world is this?
---
## HOLLOWAY:
You sit around talking about 
---
you want this 
---
you want the other 
---
you want a job 
---
you want a car. 
---
What you don't know 
---
is everybody that want one got one. 
---
You talking about you want one 
---
and ain't doing nothing to get none. 
---
The people that have them
---
is the people that wanted them. 
---
You don't do nothing
---
but sit around and talk about 
---
what you ain't got. 
---
The more you sit around and talk 
---
about what you ain't got
---
the more you have to talk about. 
---
Wait two or three years
---
and see what you have to talk about then.
---
## STERLING:
I know what I'm doing. 
---
I'm gonna get me 
---
two or three Cadillacs 
---
and everything that go with them. 
---
If I can't find no job 
---
I might have to find me a gun. 
---
Hey, Wolf, you know anybody 
---
got a gun they want to sell?
---
## WOLF:
What you looking for?
---
## STERLING:
Something that shoot straight. 
---
I don't care what it is. 
---
I don't want no .22. 
---
A .38 too big and heavy.
---
Everybody can see 
---
it's bulging out under your coat. 
---
I'll take me a snub-nosed .32 
---
if I can get one. 
---
I don't want no silver gun 
---
that shine in the dark. 
---
I'll take a black one.
---
Other than that 
---
I don't care what it is.
---
## WOLF:
Tony Jackson got an Army .45 
---
he trying to sell.
---
## STERLING:
I don't want no .45. 
---
He probably got the same one I had. 
---
You liable to end up shooting 
---
yourself with that. 
---
I was shooting at some birds one time 
---
and couldn't even hit the tree.
---
## WOLF:
I'll ask around. 
---
Let me get some sugar, Risa.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
I see where you want to go back 
---
down the penitentiary. 
---
I thought you was trying to stay out.
---
## STERLING:
You subject to end up there anyway. 
---
You don't have to do nothing 
---
to go to jail.
---
## WOLF:
You right about that. 
---
I know. 
---
You can walk down there 
---
just walk down the street 
---
and ask people
---
every nigger you see 
---
done been to jail 
---
one time or another. 
---
The white man don't feel right 
---
unless he got a record 
---
on these niggers. 
---
Walk on down there 
---
I'll give you a dollar 
---
for every nigger you find 
---
that ain't been to jail. 
---
Ain't that right, Sterling. 
---
I been to jail. 
---
Stayed down there three months. 
---
Tried to make bond 
---
and couldn't do it. 
---
They kept me down there 
---
in the county jail 
---
for three months. 
---
Ain't done nothing 
---
but walk down the street. 
---
I was walking down Centre Avenue 
---
police was chasing somebody 
---
and wasn't looking 
---
where he was going, 
---
and I wasn't looking 
---
where I was going either 
---
he ran into me so hard 
---
it knocked us both down. 
---
I started to get up
---
and there was two, 
---
three policemen 
---
with their guns pointed at my head. 
---
Told me not to move. 
---
They arrested me for 
---
obstructing justice. 
---
Kept me down there for three months
---
before the judge had a chance 
---
to throw it out. 
---
But I learned a lot from that. 
---
I learned to watch where I 
---
was going at all times. 
---
Cause you always under attack.
---
## STERLING:
That's why I said 
---
if I was going 
---
I was going for something.
---
Hey, my man. 
---
How you doing, Hambone?
---
## HAMBONE:
He gonna give me my ham. 
---
He gonna give me my ham.
---
## STERLING:
Risa, give him something to eat.
---
## RISA:
You hungry, Hambone? 
---
You want a bowl of beans?
---
## HAMBONE:
He gonna give me my ham.
---
He gonna give me my ham.
---
## WOLF:
Hey, Holloway, 
---
you know Bubba Boy, don't you?
---
Him and his woman?
---
## HOLLOWAY:
Yeah be together all the time. 
---
When you see him you see her.
---
## WOLF:
I just found out she died. 
---
She overdosed last night.
---
West just went down 
---
to pick up her body. 
---
She dead and he in jail. 
---
He went down to Surrey's 
---
to get her a dress to be buried in. 
---
You know them dresses down there 
---
cost two, three hundred dollars. 
---
He went down there 
---
like a fool 
---
and was walking out the door 
---
with the dress 
---
they arrested him. 
---
He can't even go to her funeral. 
---
The people taking up a collection 
---
to see if they can get him
---
out on bond. 
---
You wanna give anything?
---
## HOLLOWAY:
Here go a dollar.
---
## STERLING:
Holloway loan me two dollars.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
I ain't got no two dollars. 
---
If you had a job
---
you'd have two dollars.
---
## RISA:
Holloway ain't got no money. 
---
Here.
---
## STERLING:
That's for me and Hambone.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
How much is his bail?
---
## WOLF:
They got him on a 
---
two-thousand-dollar bond. 
---
I got to get two hundred dollars.
---
## STERLING:
Go ask West. 
---
He got all that money.
---
## WOLF:
West ain't gonna give a dime.
---
## STERLING:
Whoever hit the numbers 
---
ought to put in ten or twenty.
---
## WOLF:
That's what I say, 
---
but it don't always work like that.
---
Thanks, I'll see you all later.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
Let me get a dime on that 
---
nine sixty-eight before you go. 
---
I dreamt about snakes.
---
## WOLF:
I don't know what Bubba Boy's 
---
gonna do now. 
---
I ain't never seen him without her. 
---
You see him you see her. 
---
It's been like that 
---
for fifteen years. 
---
I used to look at them and say 
---
that's how deep love get. 
---
I don't know what he gonna do now.
---
## WOLF:
I don't know either. 
---
But we gonna try 
---
and get him out of jail.
---
## STERLING:
Hey, Hambone. 
---
How you doing?
---
## HAMBONE:
He gonna give me my ham.
---
## STERLING:
You want your ham?
---
## RISA:
Sterling, don't be playing 
---
with him like that.
---
## STERLING:
I ain't playing with him. 
---
Me and Hambone 
---
got us a thing going. 
---
Ain't we, Hambone?
---
## HAMBONE:
He gonna give me my ham.
---
## STERLING:
I'm trying to build up 
---
his confidence in me.
---
Ain't that right, Hambone? 
---
You don't know nothing about this. 
---
We talking man to man. 
---
Okay, Hambone,
---
check this out. 
---
Now you ready? 
---
First I say it
---
and then you say it. 
---
You ready?
---
Now listen. 
---
Take your time. 
---
Don't worry about getting it wrong. 
---
Okay.
---
Black—is—beautiful. 
---
See? Come on now. 
---
Black
---
## HAMBONE:
Black
---
## STERLING:
Is
---
## HAMBONE:
Is 
---
## STERLING:
Beautiful.
---
## HAMBONE:
Beautiful.
---
## STERLING:
Yeah, see—you got it. 
---
Black is beautiful.
---
## HAMBONE:
Black is beautiful.
---
## STERLING:
I want you to remember that 
---
now for the next time I see you. 
---
Then I'll teach you something else.
---
Okay?
---
## HAMBONE:
He gonna give me my ham. 
---
He gonna give me my ham.
---
## MEMPHIS:
These white folks crazy. 
---
Tell me my deed say
---
they can give me anything 
---
they want for my building.
---
Say it got a clause. 
---
I told them I don't care 
---
nothing about no clause. 
---
What kind of sense that make 
---
if they can give me what they want?
---
## HOLLOWAY:
How much they offer you?
---
## MEMPHIS:
Fifteen thousand dollars! 
---
I raised all kind of hell.
---
The judge looked at me 
---
like I was crazy. 
---
I told them I got a clause too. 
---
They ain't the only one got a clause.
---
My clause say they got to 
---
give me what I want for it.
---
It's my building. 
---
If they wanna buy it 
---
they got to meet my price. 
---
That's just common sense. 
---
I raised so much hell 
---
the judge postponed it 
---
told me talk to my lawyer. 
---
The lawyer looked at the deed 
---
and told me that they was right. 
---
I told him, 
---
"I don't need you no more."
---
Fired him on the spot. 
---
He supposed to be on my side.
---
They left it like that 
---
till I could get me another lawyer.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
Who was your lawyer?
---
## MEMPHIS:
Chauncey Ward. 
---
Supposed to be a big nigger
---
down there. 
---
Chauncey Ward III. 
---
His daddy was a judge.
---
You remember Chauncey Ward. 
---
The first black judge
---
they had down there. 
---
He was death on niggers. 
---
Give one fellow five hundred years.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
I know Chauncey Ward.
---
## MEMPHIS:
This his son. 
---
Ain't even looked at the paper
---
good talking about they right. 
---
I don't care what the paper say, 
---
he supposed to fix it 
---
so they meet my price.
---
I left out of there 
---
and called me one of them white lawyers, 
---
which is what I should have done 
---
in the first place.
---
Fellow named Joseph Bartoromo.
---
## STERLING:
You got insurance? 
---
If you got insurance 
---
you could burn it down.
---
## MEMPHIS:
Nigger, is you crazy! 
---
Insurance cost five times
---
what the building is worth. 
---
That's why I keep me some
---
good tenants upstairs. 
---
I don't put none of them 
---
fools up there that's liable 
---
to get drunk 
---
and burn down the place.
---
When Mr. Collins died 
---
I let it set empty three months
---
till I got somebody up there 
---
that was responsible. 
---
Look back in the kitchen 
---
ask Risa 
---
I got four or five 
---
fire extinguishers back there 
---
and you talking about
---
burning down the place. 
---
That's the one thing I am scared
of. 
---
If it burn down 
---
I don't get nothing. 
---
I don't even get the fifteen thousand.
---
See, they don't know. 
---
The half ain't never been told. 
---
I'm ready to walk through fire. 
---
I don't bother nobody. 
---
The last person I bothered is dead. 
---
My mama died in '54. 
---
I said then 
---
I wasn't going for no more draws. 
---
They don't know I feel 
---
just like I did when my mama died. 
---
She got old and gray and sat 
---
by the window till she died. 
---
She must have done that cause 
---
she ain't had nothing else to do. 
---
I was gone. 
---
My brother was gone. 
---
Sister gone. 
---
Everybody gone. 
---
My daddy was gone.
---
She sat there till she died. 
---
I was staying down on Logan Street. 
---
Got the letter one day 
---
and telegram the next.
---
They usually fall on top 
---
of one another 
---
but not that close. 
---
I got the letter say, 
---
"If you wanna see your mother
---
you better come home."
---
Before I could get out the door
---
the telegram came saying, 
---
"It's too late 
---
your mother gone." 
---
I was trying to borrow some money. 
---
Called the train station 
---
and found out the schedule 
---
and I'm trying to borrow some money. 
---
I can't go down there broke. 
---
I don't know how long 
---
I got to be there. 
---
I ain't even got the train fare. 
---
I got twelve dollars 
---
and sixty-three cents.
---
I got the telegram 
---
and sat down and cried like a baby.
---
I could beat any newborn baby 
---
in the world crying. 
---
I cried till the tears 
---
all run down in my ears. 
---
Got up and went out the door 
---
and everything looked different.
---
Everything had changed. 
---
I felt like I had been cut loose.
---
All them years 
---
something had a hold of me 
---
and I didn't know it. 
---
I didn't find out 
---
till it cut me loose. 
---
I walked out the door 
---
and everything had different 
---
colors to it. 
---
I felt great. 
---
I didn't owe nobody nothing. 
---
The last person
---
I owed anything to was gone. 
---
I borrowed fifty dollars
---
from West and went on down 
---
to her funeral. 
---
I come back and said, 
---
"Everybody better get out my way." 
---
You couldn't hold me down. 
---
It look like then 
---
I had somewhere to go fast.
---
I didn't know where, 
---
but I damn sure was going there. 
---
That's the way I feel now. 
---
They don't know 
---
I got a clause of my own.
---
I'll get up off the canvas 
---
if I have to. 
---
They can carry me out 
---
feet first 
---
but my clause say 
---
they got to meet my price!

INTERMISSION

## STERLING:
Hey, Risa. Here.
---
## RISA:
What's that?
---
## STERLING:
What they look like? 
---
Them some flowers. 
---
I got them for you.
---
## RISA:
Sterling, where you get these flowers from?
---
## STERLING:
What you worried about 
---
where I got them from? 
---
God made them. 
---
You don't ask him 
---
where he got them from. 
---
I got them, 
---
that's all that counts.
---
## RISA:
Sterling, where you get these flowers from?
---
## STERLING:
I got them from across the street. 
---
I wasn't gonna buy them. 
---
I think that's silly to buy flowers. 
---
White folks do that. 
---
If I want to buy you something 
---
I buy you earrings or something. 
---
But I got them. 
---
And I got them for you. 
---
I saw them and I said, 
---
"I'm gonna take these to Risa. 
---
She a woman. 
---
Woman supposed to like nice
things. 
---
Flowers and lace 
---
and all that kind of stuff." 
---
You better look at those flowers 
---
and see where they got your name on them. 
---
That's all you got to know.
---
## RISA:
I don't want no flowers 
---
you stole from a dead man.
---
## STERLING:
He don't mind. 
---
The man got so many flowers
---
West don't know where to put them. 
---
West had to postpone his funeral 
---
and the flowers sitting over there dying.
---
If I was gonna steal the man's flowers 
---
I'd pull a truck up there at night 
---
and go on and take the whole load. 
---
I picked them four or five 
---
cause I was thinking of you 
---
and I looked and seen 
---
where they had your name on it. 
---
Now you talking about 
---
you don't want them. 
---
Hell, a flower's a flower. 
---
They gonna be dead in a minute 
---
if you don't put them in some water. 
---
They gonna be dead 
---
in two or three days 
---
even if you do. 
---
Go on and put them in a glass
---
and enjoy them. 
---
Prophet Samuel can't smell them. 
---
He don't even know they there. 
---
People throwing all that
---
money away buying flowers.
---
## RISA:
West gonna come over here 
---
and see these flowers.
---
I'm gonna tell him 
---
where I got them from.
---
## STERLING:
I'll tell him myself. 
---
West don't care. 
---
He ain't gonna do nothing 
---
but take them out there 
---
and throw them in the ground.
---
Hey, Holloway, 
---
you think Aunt Ester be well yet?
---
## HOLLOWAY:
You can go back up there. 
---
Eighteen thirty-nine Wylie. 
---
In the back. 
---
Knock on the red door.
---
## STERLING:
I got something 
---
I wanna ask her about Risa.
---
## RISA:
You ain't got nothing 
---
to ask her about me.
---
## STERLING:
I wanna find out something. 
---
I asked God to send me an angel. 
---
He said he couldn't do that 
---
but he'd send me a teasing brown. 
---
I wanna find out if you her.
---
If you is, then look out, woman! 
---
We gonna make all kinds of babies.
---
## RISA: 
Sterling, what's that? 
---
Where you get that from?
---
## STERLING:
I found it 
---
in back of the alley 
---
down there off of Centre. 
---
In back of that drugstore. 
---
It was just sitting there 
---
wasn't nobody around 
---
so I picked it up.
---
It got five gallon of gas in it.
---
## RISA:
You done went 
---
and stole somebody's gas.
---
## STERLING:
I told you I found it, woman.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
You ought to put them flowers 
---
in a bigger glass. 
---
Put a little salt in the glass. 
---
They last longer then.
---
That's what my grandmother used to do.
---
## STERLING:

---

---
Go on outside if you wanna holler. 
---
Take that out on the street 
---

## STERLING:
We was just having some fun. 
---
Say, Memphis,

---

---
I found it in the alley 
---

---
Let you have it for two dollars.
---
## MEMPHIS:

---
## STERLING:
That gas you got ain't gonna last forever. 
---
I'll carry it out there 
---
and put it in your car if you want. 
---
It ain't gonna cost but two dollars. 
---
You know how much gas cost? 
---
Bean charge seventy-two cents a gallon. 
---
He charge three cent more 
---
than the white man.
---
## MEMPHIS:

---
Bring the can back.
---
## STERLING:
I ain't said I was selling the can. 
---
That's two dollars 
---
if you wanna buy that. 
---
This a regulation 
---
United States Army gas can. 
---
Made with good metal 
---
and everything. 
---
Bullet probably bounce right off it.
---
## MEMPHIS:
I don't want to buy the can. 
---
I just say bring it back empty.
---
## STERLING:
Give me the key 
---
and let me drive it 
---

---
## MEMPHIS:
Nigger give me back my two dollars!
---
## STERLING:

---
I wouldn't even look right 
---
driving a Cadillac.
---
## MEMPHIS:
That boy ain't got good sense. 
---
I don't want all that hollering 
---

---
Hambone paid you for these beans?
---
## RISA:

---
You got sixty-five cent?
---
Go on and finish your beans 
---

---
This ain't no number station.

---
Have my picture in the paper 
---

---
If there's one thing I can say, 
---
I ain't never had my picture 
---

---
## STERLING:

---
## MEMPHIS:

---
I don't want no part of it.

If that come out 
---

---
Risa, fix me up a plate 
---
of them short ribs. 
---
I'll be right back.
---
## MEMPHIS:

---
You hear me, 
---
Holloway? 
---
Three weeks. 
---
And he gonna be laying over there
---

---

---
in the penitentiary.
---
You watch. 
---
Three weeks.

## MEMPHIS:
Hello? 
---
Wolf don't work here!
---
## WOLF:
What you do that for, Memphis? 
---
That's my livelihood.
---
## MEMPHIS:
This my restaurant. 
---
I told you 
---
about taking numbers out of here. 
---
This is a legitimate business. 
---
This ain't no number station. 
---
Go on down to Seefus 
---
give people the number down there. 
---
Risa get these dishes cleaned up.
---
## WOLF:
Here you go, Risa 
---
let me get out of here 
---
before I get in trouble.
---
## MEMPHIS:
You gonna do more 
---
than get in trouble 
---
if you messing with me.
---
## WOLF:
See I ain't said nothing 
---
to you now, Memphis.
---
You starting something?
---
## MEMPHIS:
This my place, nigger! 
---
This my place. 
---
How you gonna have people 
---
call you at my place?
---
## WOLF:
I ain't told nobody to call me. 
---
People know I be here 
---
and they trying to catch me. 
---
I get messages everywhere I go: 
---
Nobody else don't say nothing about it.
---
## MEMPHIS:
Well, go on and get them, 
---
cause you ain't getting 
---
no more here.
---
What's that burning? Risa?
---
Risa, watch you don't burn 
---
these short ribs. 
---
You got the fire way up high. 
---
What you doing back there?
---
## RISA:
I'm getting the food ready.
---
## MEMPHIS:
That don't take all day. 
---
Them short ribs need some more water. 
---
Put some water in there.
---
Turn the fire down 
---
and get on down to the store 
---
and get some corn meal. 
---
Where's the corn meal? 
---
How you gonna make muffins 
---
without corn meal?
---
Hey, West.
---
## WEST:
Somebody done busted out my window. 
---
A great big old six-foot piece of glass! 
---
People ain't got sense enough
---
to walk through the door. 
---
Over there pushing and carrying on. 
---
Let me get some coffee, Risa. 
---
I don't care how many people 
---
be lined up there 
---
to see Prophet Samuel 
---
he leaving my place tomorrow. 
---
I'm talking about a big piece of glass! 
---
Ain't no telling how much 
---
it cost to replace that.
---
## RISA:
You ought to put a board up there.
---
## WEST:
I ain't gonna put up no board. 
---
They better get out here 
---
with that piece of glass. 
---
I spent twelve years putting
up board. 
---
I worked hard not to put up board. 
---
Let them cut a piece of glass 
---
and bring it out and bill me. 
---
There was a time 
---
when they wouldn't do that. 
---
When I was down there on Centre 
---
I couldn't get the windows fixed.
---
The toilet break down 
---
it be two weeks before 
---
somebody come and fix it. 
---
When I built that over there 
---
I said that wasn't gonna happen. 
---
Something go wrong 
---
I call the man who built it 
---
and he come right out 
---
and take care of it.
---
No, sweetheart, 
---
West ain't gonna put up no board.
---
## MEMPHIS:
I hear tell somebody 
---
tried to break in there.
---
## WEST:
Tried to come in 
---
through the basement window. 
---
Let me get a little sugar here, Risa. 
---
I hired Mason to sit over there tonight. 
---
I want to see them come in with him there.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
They be a fool to tangle with Mason 
---
and that twelve-gauge shotgun. 
---
The police sorry they had to retire
him, 
---
as many niggers as he done shot.
---
## WEST:
Say, Memphis, 
---
I told you what was gonna happen
---
when you went down there. 
---
But you don't listen to nobody. 
---
They got it all stacked up 
---
against you 
---
before you walk through the door.
---
## MEMPHIS:
That's alright. 
---
I know how to deal with white
folks. 
---
Ask Holloway. 
---
Down from where we come from
---
you learn how to deal 
---
with white folks quick. 
---
It won't be the first time 
---
I bucked heads with white folks 
---
about my property.
---
## WEST:
I tell you what I do 
---
you wanna be stubborn
---
I'll go ahead 
---
and give you twenty thousand for it.
---
## MEMPHIS:
You gonna give me twenty thousand?
---
## WEST:
We can go right on down 
---
to the bank now. 
---
I'll give you fifteen now 
---
and five thousand 
---
after I sell it to the city.
---
## MEMPHIS:
I knew there was a catch to it.
---
## WEST:
I can't give it all to you now. 
---
You know I gotta leverage it 
---
with my other property. 
---
It's liable to be two or three 
---
years before I get my money. 
---
I'm fighting with the insurance company 
---
now about my two places 
---
that burned down. 
---
I got to wait 
---
and see how all that turns out. 
---
I'll give you the fifteen now 
---
and five later.
---
## MEMPHIS:
That's alright. 
---
I see what you doing. 
---
You gonna use me 
---
to leverage your property 
---
and string me out 
---
for five thousand 
---
while you collect the interest 
---
and settle up on your insurance 
---
till you get big money 
---
and then after you get it 
---
in your pocket 
---
in two or three years 
---
then you kick me out 
---
my little five thousand dollars. 
---
That ain't right. 
---
That ain't the way to do business.
---
## WEST:
That's the only way to do business. 
---
I'm trying to help you 
---
and quite naturally 
---
I got to look for every little
---
advantage that I can get. 
---
You ought to be able to understand that.
---
## MEMPHIS:
I understand it. 
---
That's why I'm going downtown
---
to the city and get my 
---
twenty-five thousand dollars. 
---
Just like I'm going back to Jackson 
---
and get my land one of these days. 
---
I still got the deed. 
---
They ran me out of there 
---
but I'm going back. 
---
I got me a piece of farm down there.
---
Everybody said I was crazy 
---
to buy it cause it didn't 
---
have no water on it. 
---
They didn't know my grandaddy 
---
knew how to find water. 
---
If there was water anywhere 
---
under the ground he'd find it. 
---
He told me where to dig 
---
and I dug a well. 
----
Dug sixty feet down. 
---
You ain't got no idea how far that is. 
---
Took me six months hauling dirt 
---
out this little hole. 
---
Found me some water 
---
and made me a nice little crop.
---
Jim Stovall, 
---
who I bought the land from, 
---
told me my deed say 
---
if I found any water 
---
the sale was null and void. 
---
Went down to the court to 
---
straighten it out 
---
and come to find out 
---
he had a bunch of these fellows 
---
get together to pick on me. 
---
He try to act like 
---
he ain't had nothing to do with it. 
---
They took and cut my mule's belly
out 
---
while it standing there. 
---
Just took a knife and sliced it open. 
---
I stood there and watched them. 
---
They was laughing about it. 
---
I look and see 
---
where they got me covered. 
---
There's too many of them 
---
to fool around with.
---
I didn't want to die. 
---
But I loved that old mule. 
---
Me and him had been through 
---
a lot together. 
---
He was a good old mule. 
---
Remind me of myself. 
---
He only do so much amount of work 
---
and that was it. 
---
He didn't mind working. 
---
He liked to get out there and exercise. 
---
Do anything you asked him. 
---
He didn't like you to half-work him. 
---
If you gonna work him 
---
he want you to work him. 
---
Or else let him lay. 
---
He didn't like no 
---
stop-and-start work. 
---
That wasn't to his suiting. 
---
Don't tell him you gonna 
---
do one thing 
---
and then do something else. 
---
He'd lay down and tell you, 
---
"God damn it, make up your mind!" 
---
I used to take him down there 
---
and let him mate 
---
with Jimmy Hollis's mule. 
---
I figure I get mine, 
---
let him get his. 
---
A man like him a woman 
---
after a hard day's work. 
---
I stood there and watched them 
---
cut his belly open. 
---
He kinda reared back, 
---
took a few steps, 
---
and fell over. 
---
One of them reached down, 
---
grabbed hold of his dick, 
---
and cut that off. 
---
I stood there looking at them. 
---
I say, "Okay. 
---
I know the rules now. 
---
If you do that to something 
---
that ain't never done nothing to you 
---
then I know what you would do to me. 
---
So I tell you what. 
---
You go on and get your laugh now. 
---
Cause if I get out of this alive 
---
I know how to play as good as anyone." 
---
Once I know the rules, 
---
whatever they are, 
---
I can play by them.
---
Went in there, saw the judge, 
---
and he say the deed was null and void. 
---
Now I got to walk home. 
---
I was looking for them to try something. 
---
But I didn't see nobody. 
---
Got home
---
and they had set fire to my crop. 
---
To get to my house 
---
I'd have to walk through fire. 
----
I wasn't ready to do that. 
---
I turned around 
---
and walked up the hill to Natchez. 
---
Called it a draw. 
---
Said I was going back. 
---
Got up there 
---
and got tied up with one of them 
---
Mississippi gals 
---
and one year 
---
led to two 
---
led to five. 
---
Then I come on up here in '36. 
---
But I'm going back one of these days.
---
## STERLING:
Say, Mr. West, 
---
I was thinking, 
---
you know, 
---
I ain't never driven me no Cadillac. 
---
I figure everybody 
---
supposed to drive a Cadillac 
---
at least once 
---
before they die. 
---
A man got seven Cadillacs 
---
need somebody to drive them, right? 
---
You should see me drive. 
---
Can't nobody beat me driving. 
----
I drove a getaway car once. 
---
We got away, too. 
---
So, do you need any drivers?
---
## WEST:
No, I got everybody I need.
---
## STERLING:
If you ever need anybody just let me know.
Okay? I done been in the penitentiary. I'll tell you that
up front. I don't want to go back. I figure everybody
should work at what they like to do. So I asked myself,
"Sterling, what you like to do?" The closest I could come
up with was I like to drive a Cadillac. So if you ever
need anybody you think of me. Do you have to wash
the cars if you drive them? I don't want to wash them
without driving them. But if I could wash them seven at
a time every day for about five dollars apiece I might do
that. How long you reckon it take to do that? I don't
reckon it take more than three hours. If you do a good
job. I could do that for you.
---
## WEST:
Naw, I got somebody to wash my cars.
---
## STERLING:
I know. Every time I see them they be clean.
Except for the grille. I could clean the grille better than
that. You ought to tell them to get a little brush to scrub
in them little spots with. It won't hurt the chrome none.
Mr. Lewis taught me how to do that.
---
## WEST:
If I ever need anybody I'll let you know.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
Did you go back up there to see Aunt Ester?
---
## STERLING:
I went back up there they told me she was
asleep.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
You give her a chance to get her rest, then
you go on back up there. I'm going up and see her my-
self. West been up there. He don't like to tell nobody,
but he been up there.
---
## WEST:
I don't care who know. Yeah, I been up there.


---
## MEMPHIS:
You been up there, West?
---
## WEST:
Yeah, I went up there and saw her. I didn't take
her to be no more than a hundred or so.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
Tell him when that was. Tell him how long
that's been.
---
## WEST:
It's been twenty-two years. That don't mean she still
alive. I ain't seen her in twenty-two years and she look
like she was half-dead then. I can't imagine what she
look like now.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
She look like she looked then. She wasn't but
three hundred years old then. I don't reckon them twenty-
two years make that much difference to her.
---
## WEST:
The oldest person I buried was Miss Sarah Degree
and she was a hundred and twelve. I don't think nobody
can live too much longer than that.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
You can go on back up and see her. She still
there.
---
## MEMPHIS:
What you go up there for, West?
---
## WEST:
I went up there to see if my wife was in heaven. I
done buried a whole lot of people, but she the first one
I ever wondered about. See, people don't understand
about death, but if you ever hear one of them coffin
sounds you'd know. There ain't nothing like it. That cof-
fin get to talking and you know that this here this
what we call life ain't nothing. You can blow it away
with a blink of an eye. But death you can't blow
away death. It lasts forever. I didn't understand about it
till my wife died. Before that it was just a job. Then


when she died I come to understand it. You can live to
be a hundred and fifty and you'll never have a greater
moment than when you breathe your last breath. Ain't
nothing you can do in life compared to it. See, right then
you done something. You became a part of everything
that come before. And that's a great thing. Ain't nothing
you can do in life compared to that. So I heard about
Aunt Ester and went to see if my wife was in heaven. I
figure if anybody know she would.
---
## MEMPHIS:
What she tell you?
---
## WEST:
She told me to take and throw twenty dollars in the
river and come back and see her. I thought she was
crazy, to tell you the truth. I didn't pay her no mind. I
knew she was old, but I figure she had gotten too old.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
That's what your problem is. You don't want
to do nothing for yourself. You want somebody else to
do it for you. Aunt Ester don't work that way. She say
you got to pull your part of the load. But you didn't
want to do that. That's why you don't know. And it
didn't cost you but twenty dollars.
---
## WEST:
I wasn't gonna throw my money in the river, nigger.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
That's why you don't know. You don't know
what might have happened if you did that. If you had
gone on back up there she might have told you.
---
## WEST:
I offered to give her the twenty dollars just for her
time but she wouldn't take it. Told me to throw it
in the river. I'd rather see her with it than to see it at
the bottom of the river. I just wasn't gonna do that with
my money.


---
## HOLLOWAY:
That's why you don't know.
---
## WEST:
If it take throwing my money in the river to find
out then I ain't never gonna know.
---
## MEMPHIS:
What you go up to see her about, Holloway?
What happened when you threw your twenty dollars in?
---
## HOLLOWAY:
I went up there to see her cause I wanted to
kill my grandfather. I went up there and got that feeling
off me. I had to throw twenty dollars every week for a
month. But I got it off me. He died from natural causes.
Ask West he buried him. He died in his sleep. That's
why I knew it worked. Cause he died of natural death.
---
## MEMPHIS:
What you wanna kill your grandfather for?
---
## HOLLOWAY:
Now you getting in my business. Ask West if
he ain't died a natural death. That's all you need to
know.
---
## MEMPHIS:
I don't care nothing about your business. You
the one brought it up. I ain't even know you had a
grandfather.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
Had two of them. One on my mother's side
and one on my father's side. One of them I never knew.
The other one wasn't no good for nobody. That was the
worse Negro I ever known. He think if it wasn't for
white people there wouldn't be no daylight. If you let
him tell it, God was a white man who had a big planta-
tion in the sky and sat around drinking mint juleps and
smoking Havana cigars. He couldn't wait to die to get
up in heaven to pick cotton. If he overheard you might
wanna go down and get you some extra meat out the
white man's smokehouse he'd run and tell him. He


see you put a rabbit in your sack to weigh up with the
cotton, he'd run and tell. The white man would give him
a couple pounds of bacon. He'd bring that home and my
grandmother would throw it out with the garbage. That's
the kind of woman she was. I don't know how she got
tied up with him. She used to curse the day she laid
down with him. That rubbed off on me. I got a little
older to where I could see what kind of man he was
I figure if he want to go to heaven to pick cotton, I'd
help him. I got real serious about it. It stayed on me so
didn't nobody want to be around me cause of the bad
energy I was carrying. Couldn't keep me a woman.
Seemed like nothing wouldn't work out for me. I went
up to see Aunt Ester and got that bad energy off me.
And it worked too. Ask West. He died in his sleep.
Caught pneumonia and laid down and died. They
wouldn't let him in the hospital cause he didn't have any
insurance. He crawled up in the bed in my grandmother's
house and laid there till he died. March 5, 1952. So can't
nobody tell me nothing about Aunt, Ester. I know what
she can do for you.
---
## WEST:
Let me get on. Say, Memphis, if you change your
mind about the building, let me know.
(WEST exits.)
---
## STERLING:
I'm going back up there soon as I get some
money. I'll throw twenty dollars in the river if it help
me get a job.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
You go on back up there.
---
## STERLING:
Say, Memphis you know how many people
be down at the steel mill hanging around there at lunch


time? You ever seen that? Must be five or six hundred,
I figure we could make some money selling chicken sand-
wiches. All you need is a little truck have Risa fry
up the chicken and I go over there and sell them. You
ever thought about that? We could go in business
together.
---
## MEMPHIS:
I'm in business already. You go on and get your
truck and go on over there. Risa get these dishes
cleaned up.
STERLING (starting toward the door): That alright if
that seven eighty-one come out I'll have me enough
money I won't need to go in no business. If that seven
eighty-one come out me and Risa gonna get married.
Ain't that right, Risa?
(RisA doesn't say anything.)
She shy. She don't want to let everybody know. Hey,
Memphis, if I find some more gas I'll bring it on around.
Okay?
(STERLING exits.)
---
## MEMPHIS:
I changed that, Holloway. I give him two weeks.
(The lights go down on the scene.)
SCENE 2
(The lights come up on the restaurant. RISA sits on a
stool, reading a magazine. HOLLOWAY enters.)
---
## HOLLOWAY:
Risa, you seen Hambone today?
---
## RISA:
Naw, he ain't been in here.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
You know he wasn't over there this morning.
Lutz asked me about him.
---
## RISA:
He ain't been in here. Anybody know where he stay
at?
---
## HOLLOWAY:
He was staying up there on Arcena Street.
He stayed up there for the longest time. He ain't up
there no more. Nobody know where he stay at.
---
## RISA:
Maybe he just quit coming. He might have moved
to Homewood or East Liberty. Got tired of waiting on
Lutz to give him his ham.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
I ain't known him to miss a day in nine and
a half years. He come and stand there even on Sunday
just in case Lutz show up. That don't sound like nobody
got tired of waiting.
(woLF enters.)
---
## WOLF:
Hey Holloway. Did you see that out there this
morning? West was having a fit trying to bury Prophet
Samuel.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
Yeah, I was out there. They say the hearse
was at the cemetery and some of the cars hadn't even
left from in front of the funeral home.
---
## WOLF:
They had the boulevard backed up two miles. Peo-
ple's cars overheating. They tried to block off the street
and let the cars go in two lanes, but the people was
arguing with the police and wouldn't let them do it. They
had helicopters flying all over the place.


---
## RISA:
Look like they had more people watching than was
in the funeral. They was lined up on both sides of the
street. Half of them was in here.
---
## WOLF:
I know. I couldn't get near the door. That was the
biggest funeral West ever had.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
It wasn't as big as Patchneck Red's funeral.
This wasn't nothing but Pittsburgh niggers. For
Patchneck Red's funeral they came from Detroit, Cleve-
land, and all parts of Ohio and New Jersey. Youngstown
. Newark Jersey City. Come from West Virginia.
They had eleven Cadillacs full of women come all the
way from Vegas. People didn't leave the cemetery till
the next morning. They was out there pouring whiskey
on the grave had two five-gallon buckets full of dice
and fifty-eleven decks of cards they dumped in the grave
with him. Prophet Samuel wasn't nothing like that. You
find out anything about Hambone?
---
## WOLF:
I been asking around. Ain't nobody seen him. Last
time anybody seen him was yesterday.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
Lutz say he ain't seen him either.
---
## WOLF:
How you doing, Risa? You lucky to see me today.
If that six fifty-seven had come out I'd be in Atlanta
right now.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
Who you know in Atlanta, Wolf?
---
## WOLF:
I got me a woman down there. Got two. Got one
up on Jackson Hill and the other one stay on Lombard
Street. One of them got four or five other men, but
that's alright with me. All I got to do is call. All she got
to do is hear my voice and she drop them other niggers.


All she got to do is hear my voice and she come running.
Any time of day or night.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
Well, why ain't you down there, then? You
walking around here without a woman talking about you
got two in Atlanta. Why ain't you there?
---
## WOLF:
I can't go down there unless I got some money.
One of them think I'm a rich man. Last time she seen
me I had six or seven hundred dollars in my pocket.
Spent two hundred of it on her. She think I got that kind
of money all the time. If that six fifty-seven had come
out I'd been right there sitting on her doorstep. I had
ten dollars straight on it. That's Harvey's number. He
hit on that two or three times a year. I figured today
might have been his lucky day.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
I see you and Memphis got in a little hassle
yesterday.
---
## WOLF:
We alright. Memphis gets beside himself sometimes.
See, he don't know he lucky I understand him. Without
that understanding it be a different thing.
(MEMPHIS enters.)
---
## HOLLOWAY:
Hey, Memphis. You know Hambone didn't
come today? You ain't seen him, have you?
---
## MEMPHIS:
Naw, I ain't seen him.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
That ain't like him not to show up.
---
## MEMPHIS:
Risa, get these dishes cleaned off the counter.
(He and WOLF glare at each other.)
---
## HOLLOWAY:
Hey, Wolf, give me a dime on nine sixty-
eight. I'm gonna keep playing it till it come out.


---
## WOLF:
I got to ask Memphis. Memphis, is it okay if I take
Holloway's number? I mean, since this is a legitimate
business and all.
---
## MEMPHIS:
I said I didn't want you using my phone, Wolf.
Yo u can twist it all out of shape if you want. I can't have
them running in here raiding my place. I don't take no
numbers out of here. Seem like you be able to under-
stand that.
---
## WOLF:
I understand it. What you want, Holloway?
---
## HOLLOWAY:
Give me a dime on nine sixty-eight. Box it
for a nickel.
(wou writes down his number.)
---
## MEMPHIS:
Give me a dollar on four seventy-eight.
---
## WOLF:
You know, Sterling hit for two dollars yesterday on
that seven eighty-one? He ain't gonna like it none, but
they cut the number. They cut it in half. They ain't pay-
ing but half of it. I don't know what it was seem
like every nigger in Pittsburgh played seven eighty-one.
Ain't nobody gonna like it, but he ain't gonna like it
especially. I started to carry my pistol today, but I say,
"Naw I might kill somebody." Most people under-
stand when they cut the numbers but I don't know
about Sterling. He got his own way of looking at things.
Holloway, if you see him would you try and explain it
to him that it ain't my fault cause I will go to the pawn-
shop and get my pistol. So if you could explain that to
him before I see him I'd appreciate it. That way you be
helping us both out.


---
## HOLLOWAY:
If I know him like I think I do, he gonna
wanna know why everybody play his number instead of
their own. Then he gonna come to understand that he
don't care how many people played it the Alberts
still owe him all his money. And since you work for the
Alberts, if you don't get him his money, then you all in
cahoots, and the Alberts is splitting it with you, and you
gonna buy a Cadillac next week with his money
therefore you gonna need your pistol. And if it go that
way West is gonna get a chance to bury one of you.
If he go up there and mess with the Alberts, then West
gonna have to bury him in a closed casket. Now I'm
sixty-five years old and I got that way by staying out of
people's business, so no I ain't gonna tell him noth-
ing. If he come in here right now I'd walk out. Come back
tomorrow and Risa will have to tell me what happened.
---
## WOLF:
Well, I ain't gonna pay him out my pocket. The
hell with it. You right. I got to go to the pawnshop and
get my pistol. Hey, Risa, I'll be back. If Sterling comes,
tell him I was looking to see him.
(woLF exits.)
---
## HOLLOWAY:
I don't know why I play the numbers. The Al-
berts want all the advantages. They got six hundred-to-one
odds, but that ain't enough for them. If thirty or forty
niggers get lucky enough to hit the numbers the same day,
they don't even want them to enjoy their luck. They want
to take that away from them. They don't say nothing about
cutting the numbers when six thousand. niggers guess wrong.
---
## MEMPHIS:
They been cutting numbers for the past hundred
years. That's part of the game. You supposed to under-
stand that when you play your money. If I was—


(He spies the flyer on the wall.)
What the hell this doing up here?
(He tears it down and crumples it up.)
I don't want this up in my place. I ain't putting no sanc-
tion on nothing like that. That's what the problem is
now. All them niggers wanna do is have a rally. Soon as
they finish with one rally they start planning for the next.
They forget about what goes in between. You rally to
spur you into action. When it comes time for action these
niggers sit down and scratch their heads. They had that
boy Begaboo. The police walked up and shot him in the
head and them same niggers went down there to see the
mayor. Raised all kind of hell. Trying to get the cop
charged with murder. They raised hell for three weeks.
After that it was business as usual. The only thing any-
body remember is the funeral. That's the Sterling boy
bringing that stuff in here. Something wrong with that
boy. That boy ain't right.
(To RisA.:)
If I was you I'd stay away from him. He ain't gonna do
nothing but end up right back down there in the
penitentiary.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
You might be right. Now he done got him a
gun. What he gonna do with it? A nigger with a gun is
bad news. You can't even use the word "nigger" and
"gun" in the same sentence. You say the word "gun" in
the same sentence with the word "nigger" and you in
trouble. The white man panic. Unless you say, "The po-
liceman shot the nigger with his gun" then that be
alright. Other than that he panic. He ain't had nothing
but guns for the last five hundred years got the
atomic bomb and everything. But you say the word "nig-

L._

ger" and "gun" in the same sentence and they'll try and
arrest you. Accuse you of sabotage, disturbing the peace,
inciting a riot, plotting to overthrow the government and
anything else they can think of. You think I'm lying?
Yo u go down there and stand in front of the number
two police station and say, "The niggers is tired of this
mistreatment—they gonna get some guns," and see if
they don't arrest you.
---
## MEMPHIS:
As young and as crazy as that boy is, he need
to carry one.
(STERLING enters.)
---
## STERLING:
How you doing, Memphis? Risa Wolf been
in here?
---
## RISA:
He just left. He say he be back.
---
## STERLING:
I was out there watching them bury Prophet
Samuel. Harvey gave me a ride to the cemetery. Was
you over there, Risa? I was looking for you.
---
## RISA:
Everybody running over there to see him cause he
dead. They didn't go see him when he was alive. He was
right up there on Herron Avenue. They wasn't lining up
there then.
---
## STERLING:
It be like that with everything. People don't
care nothing about you till you dead. Then they walk
around and tell everybody how well they knew you and
that make them special for a day or two. You always have
more followers when you dead than when you living.
---
## RISA:
That's what I'm saying. Prophet Samuel used to
preach about hypocrites and that's what half them people
is. If you be a hypocrite it don't count with, God. He


want you all the time. That's what Prophet Samuel say.
God can look into your heart and tell. But see I
knew Prophet Samuel when he was living.
(She hands STERLING a card. He takes it and reads.)
STERLING (reading): "This certifies that Risa Thomas is a
member in good standing of the First African Congrega-
tional Kingdom, having duly paid all tithing. Signed,
Prophet Samuel."
(He hands her back the card.)
I remember Prophet Samuel,, but I ain't paid preachers
or nothing like that no mind.
---
## RISA:
Prophet Samuel wasn't no preacher. He was a
prophet like they have in the Bible. God sent him to
help the colored people get justice.
---
## MEMPHIS:
The people ain't thinking about no justice when
they lined up there. They thinking about money like
Prophet Samuel. That's all he thought about. Justice
come second. When God send you he pay your way.
God ain't paid Prophet Samuel's way. The people paid
Prophet Samuel's way hoping they get a financial bless-
ing. You running up there giving him your little bit of
change—what it get you? I wish I had three, four hun-
dred people bringing me money every week. That be all
the financial blessing I need.
---
## RISA:
That's cause you don't believe in nothing. Whatever
Prophet Samuel prophesied, it come true.
---
## STERLING:
Did he say anything about these being the last
days? That's what I believe. I believe the world coming
to an end.


---
## RISA:
He said God was gonna send a sign. That's all he
said about that. Said you would see it, but only the wise
men would know what it meant.
---
## STERLING:
I be looking at the moon. Seem like it's getting
closer and closer. You ever notice that? You look up
and see if it ain't getting closer. Maybe that's what he
meant by a sign. You look next time when the moon be
full and see if it ain't getting closer. You look and then
go right back in your house. I don't go outside when it's
a full moon. There be at least three or four people killed
that night. I believe the world coming to an end.
(RBA exits into the back.)
---
## MEMPHIS:
If it do be the end of the world, what you gonna
do? You can't do nothing but go down with it. It's foolish
to worry about something like that. Something you ain't
got no control over. If these niggers spent half the time
they spend worrying about stuff like that and more time
trying to figure out how to get out of the situation they
in they wouldn't have all the problems they got now.
---
## STERLING:
Soon as I find Wolf I ain't gonna have no more
problems. Hey, Risa if you see Wolf tell him
I'm looking for him. He knows what it's about.
(STERLING exits.)
MEMPHIS (calling): Risa!
---
## RISA:
What?
---
## MEMPHIS:
Come here, woman. (Pause.) If you want your
pay you better get out here.
(RisA enters.)
I owe you forty-six dollars with the ten you took.


---
## RISA:
I don't owe you but seven.
---
## MEMPHIS:
You ain't counting the three dollars you got the
other day to buy some hair grease. You ain't counting that.
---
## RISA:
I told you I put the three dollars back cause they
ain't had the kind I wanted.
---
## MEMPHIS:
Well, write a note saying you put it back. How
in the hell I'm supposed to know you put it back? Here
• take this forty-nine dollars. I got some business to
take care of don't forget to put the bread in the
refrigerator when you lock up. Put the bread in the re-
frigerator and make sure you pull the shade down on the
door. I got to go down to the courthouse in the morning
▪ make sure you got enough eggs before you leave
out of here. Well, Holloway I was talking to my
lawyer Joseph Bartoromo I was talking to him
on the phone. He said let him handle it. I ain't gonna
let him handle it but so far. I told him like I tell you
▪ I ain't going for no more draws and I ain't
taking a penny less than twenty-five thousand dollars.
(He starts to exit and stops at the door.)
What's that address?
---
## HOLLOWAY:
Eighteen thirty-nine Wylie. In the back.
Knock on the red door.
(The lights go down on the scene.)
SCENE 3
(The lights come up on RISA and HOLLOWAY. WOLF sits


at the table doing his bookkeeping. RISA is sweeping. It
is later the same day.)
---
## HOLLOWAY:
He was staying up there on Herron Avenue.
They found him up there today. His landlady found him.
He just laid down across the bed with his clothes on and
died. Say he died real peaceful. West went down to the
morgue to get him he got some kind of contract with
the welfare and they called him up. Hambone ain't had
no people. Most anybody know about him is he come
from Alabama. Don't nobody even know his right name.
---
## RISA:
That's a shame. Lutz gonna rot in hell.
---
## WOLF:
Lutz ain't thinking about no hell. All he thinking
about is his ham.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
I went up there and told him about it cause
he asked me to let him know what I found out. He didn't
say nothing. He just looked at me.
(RBA accidentally sweeps WOLF'S feet.)
---
## WOLF:
Don't sweep me with that broom, girl. Ain't your
mama never taught you nothing?
---
## RISA:
Well, move your feet out the way then.
---
## WOLF:
You sweep me with that broom and I'll end up in jail.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
That's what's wrong with half these niggers
now. They don't know what causes their trouble. They
around here breaking mirrors, opening umbrellas in the
house, and everything else.
---
## WOLF:
Come on, Risa!


---
## RISA:
Move your feet then, Wolf! You be gone to jail twice
you don't move your feet.
(She sweeps him again.)
---
## WOLF:
Hey, Risa. Come on, now!
(He gets up and gathers his papers.)
A man can't get no peace around here. If you see Ster-
ling, tell him I'm looking for him. Tell him to wait here,
I'll be back.
(woLF exits.)
---
## HOLLOWAY:
A man was driving a truck hauling a
whole truck full of mirrors .,lost the brakes and ran
into a telephone pole. He wasn't hurt or nothing. He
looked back there and saw all them mirrors broke
he was staring at two hundred years of bad luck. They
had to carry him away in a straitjacket.
(WEST enters.)
Hey, West I see you finally got Prophet Samuel buried.
---
## WEST:
Yeah I got him in the ground and turned
around and went down there and got Hambone. It don't
never stop. Time you bury one nigger you got to go get
another. Man had so many scars on his body. I ain't
never seen nothing like that. All on his back, his chest
his legs. I'm gonna lay him out tomorrow and bury
him on Saturday.
---
## RISA:
You ought to lay him out in a nice casket. I hate to
see people laid out in them welfare caskets.
---
## WEST:
That's a poor man's casket. What you call a pauper's
casket. He wouldn't look right laying in a bronze or sil-
ver casket.


---
## RISA:
I hate to see him in a welfare casket. Like his life ain't
meant nothing. How much one of them other casket's cost?
---
## WEST:
You talking about a seven-hundred-dollar differ-
ence. The welfare don't pay but three hundred and fifty
dollars. That don't even cover laying him out. I'm laying
him out for free. I'm gonna lay him out for two hours
tomorrow and take him on out there and bury him. You
talking about a bronze casket you talking about seven
hundred dollars. At least.
---
## RISA:
Ain't you got some other caskets over there?
---
## WEST:
I don't get them for free, woman. I call the company
and order the casket, they send me the bill. We talking
about a seven-hundred-dollar difference.
---
## RISA:
I wish I had seven hundred dollars to give you. I'd
lay him out in a gold casket.
---
## WEST:
Now you talking about a seventeen-hundred-dollar
difference. People don't understand. I got overhead. I
got seven cars I got to keep up. Got supplies I got to
order. How much you think that embalming fluid cost?
I got all kinds of bills. People owe me money and won't
pay me. It ain't all like everybody think with Mr. West.
---
## RISA:
I ain't said nothing about that.
---
## WEST:
You talking about why don't I lay him out in a
different casket. That three hundred and fifty dollars barely
cover my expenses. You can't put nobody in the ground
for three hundred and fifty dollars no more. I bury him in
a different casket I'm out seven hundred dollars. I try to
tell these niggers to keep up their insurance.
(STERLING enters.)


---
## RISA:
Sterling, Wolf was looking for you.
---
## STERLING:
Naw, he ain't. I'm looking for him. Nigger owe
me twelve hundred dollars. Come on, let's go to Vegas.
I got me a grubstake, I might get lucky. These niggers
ain't got no money around here. Come on take off
that apron. How you doing, Mr. West?
---
## WEST:
Fine.
---
## STERLING:
Say, Mr. West you ever been to Vegas?
Yo u ought to let me take you to Vegas and teach you
how to gamble. We can make us some money.
---
## WEST:
I was gambling before you was born. Give me some
sugar, Risa. I ran two or three crap games. Sold bootleg
liquor and ran numbers too. The only thing you get out
of that is an early grave. I know. I seen it happening. I
looked up one day and so many people was dying from
that fast life I figured I could make me some money
burying them and live a long life too. I figured I could
make a living from it. I didn't know I was gonna get
rich. I found out life's hard but it ain't impossible.
---
## STERLING:
That's what I figure. I get my money from Wolf
get in one of them white folks' crap games it be
impossible to stop me. I'm gonna get me two or three
Cadillacs like you. Get Risa to be my woman and I'll be
alright. That's all a man need is a pocketful of money,
a Cadillac, and a good woman. That's all he need on
the surface. I ain't gonna talk about that other part of
satisfaction. But I got sense enough to know it's there.
I know if you get the surface it don't mean nothing unless
you got the other. I know that, Mr. West. Sometimes I


think I'll just take the woman part. And then sometimes
that don't seem like it's enough.
---
## WEST:
That's cause you walking around here with a ten-
gallon bucket. Somebody put a little cupful in and you get
mad cause it's empty. You can't go through life carrying a
ten-gallon bucket. Get you a little cup. That's all you need.
Get you a little cup and somebody put a little bit in and
it's half full. That ten-gallon bucket ain't never gonna be
full. Carry you a little cup through life and you'll never be
disappointed. I'll tell you what my daddy told me. I was
a young man just finding my way through life. I told him
I wanted to find me a woman and go away and get me a
ranch and raise horses like my grandaddy. I was still wait-
ing around to find the woman. He told me to get the ranch
first and the woman would come. And he was right. I
never did get me the ranch, but he was right.
---
## STERLING:
That's what I'm gonna do, Mr. West. You hear
that, Risa? Soon as I get my money we going to Vegas
and I'm gonna get me enough money to buy us a ranch.
Yo u like horses? I ain't never seen a real horse. I wouldn't
know how to act around one. But if that's what it takes
to get a woman like you I'm willing to do that. What's the
matter? Don't you wanna go to Vegas with me?
---
## RISA:
Go on, Sterling, I don't feel like playing.
(To WEST)
Ain't you got no other kind of metal casket over there?
What about one of them copper caskets?
---
## WEST:
The government don't pay but three hundred and
fifty dollars, woman! I'm doing him a favor laying him
out. How you expect me to meet my expenses? If I laid
everybody out in a bronze casket at my expense I'd be
out of business.
---
## RISA:
I ain't talking about everybody. I'm talking about
Hambone.
---
## WEST:
Insurance don't cost but two dollars a month. I try
to tell people that.
---
## STERLING:
Hambone dead? Risa Hambone dead?
---
## RISA:
They found him this morning laying across his bed.
(STERLING is thrown for a moment, but recovers
quickly.)
---
## STERLING:
That don't surprise me. Don't nothing surprise
me no more.
(woLF enters.)
Hey, Wolf just the man I want to see. I need my
money. Me and Risa getting married and Reverend
Flowers want fifty dollars the cake man want fifty
dollars the jewelry man want two hundred dollars.
Hey, Risa you want to invite Wolf? She say yeah.
We ain't set the date yet but we let you know.
Where's my money, nigger? You got my money?
---
## WOLF:
Look, Sterling it ain't my fault but they
cut the number. They cut it in half. They ain't paying
but six hundred dollars.
---
## STERLING:
I'm like Joe Louis. They cut the odds on Joe
Louis all the time. That seven eighty-one was like a
knockout punch. I knew it was gonna hit. I'm going up
and tell the Alberts that seven eighty-one don't hit like
a .45. Mr. West, you don't bury white people, do you?


That's alright. I ain't gonna kill nobody. I'll just put them
in a wheelchair.
(To ---
## WOLF:
)
And I'm gonna start with you if you don't give me my
twelve hundred dollars.
---
## WOLF:
I'm gonna tell you one more time, Sterling. I ain't
had nothing to do with it. I know you mad. Everybody
mad. They mad out in East Liberty. People in Beltz-
hoover everybody all up and down the avenue mad.
I ain't had nothing to do with it. If it was up to me I'd
pay everybody what they due. This is a job to me. That
little bit they pay me ain't worth all that. They call me,
say, "Wolf, the numbers cut in half." I say, "Okay."
That's the way that go. The best I can say is you lucky
they didn't cut it seven ways.
---
## STERLING:
Naw flaw, what you telling me is me and
Risa got to postpone our getting married.
---
## RISA:
I ain't said nothing about getting married. Don't be
telling everybody that. Wolf, don't pay him no mind
about that.
---
## STERLING:
See what I mean? Risa done changed her mind.
I'm going up and see the Alberts, see if they change
theirs. Give me my six hundred dollars, nigger.
(woLF pays him the money.)
I'm going up there and give it back to them. See Old
Man Albert himself. Let him know an airplane can fall
on his head.
(STERLING starts to exit.)
---
## WOLF:
Don't do that, Sterling. Them people don't play.


---
## STERLING:
If I don't play that mean there can't be no
game. I'm going up there and carry me a big sign say
"Game Canceled." See? Cause I don't play either.
(STERLING exits.)
RISA (calling after him): Sterling!
(The lights go down on the scene.)
SCENE 4
(The lights come up on the restaurant. RISA is sweeping
the floor. STERLING enters.)
---
## STERLING:
I come by to see if you wanna go to the rally.
(He doesn't get a response.)
It done started already but I figure we won't be too late.
---
## RISA:
You left out of here talking about you was gonna
see the Alberts. We didn't know if we was gonna
see you again.
---
## STERLING:
I didn't know it mattered to nobody. I heard
you calling me. What you calling after me for?
---
## RISA:
I just didn't want to see you get killed.
---
## STERLING:
I went up there to see Old Man Albert. He
sitting up there with four or five bodyguards. They let
me in to see him and I told him to give me back my two
dollars. Said I was calling off the bet. He gave me the
two dollars and asked me for his six hundred back. I
told him no. Told him I was gonna keep that. That way
I have something that belong to him for a change. He
just looked at me funny and told me to leave the same


way I had come in. Told one of his bodyguards to show
me the door. I left out of there and was walking by Aunt
Ester's. I saw the light on and I figure she might be up,
so I stopped to see her. They led me into the hallway
and then through some curtains into this room and
she was just sitting there. I talked to her a long while.
To l d her my whole life story. She real nice. Ain't nobody
ever talk to me like that. "I cannot swim does not walk
by the lakeside." It took me a while to figure out what
she meant. Told me, "Make better what you have and
you have best." Then she wrote down something on a
piece of paper, put it in a little envelope, told me to put
it in my shoe and walk around on it for three days. I
asked her how much I owed her. She told me to take
twenty dollars and throw it in the river. Say she get it.
She had this look about her real calm and sweet like. I
asked her how old she was. She say she was three hun-
dred and forty-nine years old. Holloway had it wrong. I
figured anybody that old know what she talking about.
I took twenty dollars and carried it down there. Didn't
even think about it. I just took and threw it in the river.
I'm gonna wait them three days and see what happen.
Yo u ought to go up there and see her. She a real nice
old lady. She say yeah, you the one God sent when he
told me he couldn't send no angel.
---
## RISA:
Sterling, you crazy.
---
## STERLING:
I figure me and you get us a nice little old
place. Ain't you tired of sleeping by yourself? I am.
---
## RISA:
Naw, I'm just fine taking care of me.
---
## STERLING:
You ain't got to take care of you let me
do that. I'll take care of you real good.

(He sings:)
Wake up, Pretty Mama
See what I got for you
I got everything
Set your poor heart at ease
I got everything for you, woman.
I got a list of things
long as my right arm.
---
## RISA:
Naw, that's alright.
---
## STERLING:
Woman, you everything a man need. Know
how to cook pay nice attention to yourself ex-
cept for those legs. You ought not to have done that.
What you do that for anyway?
---
## RISA:
You wouldn't understand, Sterling.
---
## STERLING:
You be surprised I got good understanding.
That's what Aunt Ester told me. She looked at me and
say, "I like to work with people like you cause you got
good understanding." She say that before I could say
anything to her. She just looked at me and said that.
Now why can't you do that?
---
## RISA:
What you looking at my legs for anyway?
---
## STERLING:
That's part of life, woman. You don't think I'm
not gonna look at them? Even if you tried to make them
ugly. So you wanted to have ugly legs you got them.
Now what? I done looked at your legs, your hips, your
titties, and everything else. Now what? I don't care if
you got scars on your legs.
---
## RISA:
That's why I did it. To make them ugly.
---
## STERLING:
You did a good job. You and God both. He
made them pretty and you made them ugly. You both
got what you wanted. Now why can't I get what I want?
---
## RISA:
That's what the problem is.
---
## STERLING:
I know that's a problem. I'm trying to solve it.
---
## RISA:
You just want what everybody else want.
---
## STERLING:
Risa you in the world, baby. You a woman
in the world. You here like everybody else. You got to
make the best of it. Quite naturally when men see you
with that big ass and them pretty legs they gonna try and
talk you into a bed somewhere. That's common sense.
They be less than a man if they didn't. Ain't no sense in
you getting upset about that. You ought to take it as a
compliment. All you got to do is say no and keep on
stepping.
---
## RISA:
That just what I done.
---
## STERLING:
I know that. Been telling me no since I met
you. By rights I should be talking to somebody else. I
tried that. But I was talking to her and thinking of you.
So I come on back.
---
## RISA:
You ain't got no job. You going back to the peniten-
tiary. I don't want to be tied up with nobody I got to be
worrying is they gonna rob another bank or something.
---
## STERLING:
When I was living with Mrs. Johnson before
she died I used to watch her husband. He get up every
morning at six o'clock. Sunday too. Six-thirty he out the
door. Now he ain't coming back till ten o'clock at
night. He going down to J&I, and lift hundred-pound
100 •

slabs of steel till three o'clock. Then he going over after
they close the fish market and clean up over there. Now
what he got? He got six kids of his own, not to mention
me. He got a raggedy house with some beat-up furniture.
Can't buy no house cause he can't get a loan. Now that
sound like a hard-working man. Good. Clean. Honest.
Upright. He work thirty years at the mill and ain't even
got a union card. You got to work six months straight.
They lay him off for two weeks every five and a half
months. He got to call the police after he clean up the
fish market so they can let him out of the building. Make
sure he don't steal anything. What they got? Two pound
of catfish? There got to be something else. I ain't sure I
want to do all that.
---
## RISA:
You got to do something.
---
## STERLING:
Okay. Okay. If you don't want to get married
and have babies and all that then can we be cousins?
Can we be kissing cousins? How's that?
(He has cornered her. RISA pushes him away.)
---
## RISA:
Go on, Sterling leave me alone now.
---
## STERLING:
Risa, baby
RBA: What?

## STERLING:
I ain't never met no woman like you.
---
## RISA:
I ain't met no man like you either. But that don't
mean I'm gonna get tied up with you. You'll never have
me sitting and worrying what you gonna do next.
---
## STERLING:
Well, come on and go to the rally with me.
---
## RISA:
I ain't going to no rally. You can just go on by yourself.


(RISA goes over to the jukebox and puts in a quarter.
"Take a Look" by Aretha Franklin begins to play.)
---
## STERLING:
When did that get fixed?
---
## RISA:
Today.
STERLING (hesitant): Yo u wanna dance?
---
## RISA:
Yeah.
(They begin to dance. STERLING kisses her lightly.)
---
## STERLING:
How's that? You wanna be kissing cousins?
(He kisses her passionately.)
Goddamn, baby!
---
## RISA:
Sterling.
---
## STERLING:
I didn't know it was gonna be like this. You
can be my first cousin.
RISA (between kisses): I wanna be your only cousin.
---
## STERLING:
That too.
(STERLING kisses her as the lights go down.)
SCENE 5
(The lights come up on the restaurant. The menu board
reads, "Funeral for Hambone Saturday One O'Clock."
HOLLOWAY sits in a booth. RISA is cooking. STERLING
stands looking out the window.)
---
## HOLLOWAY:
That's all you got. You got love and you got
death. Death will find you it's up to you to find
love. That's where most people fall down at. Death got


room for everybody. Love pick and choose. Now, most
people won't admit that. They tell you they love this one
and that one. Most don't even love their mother. You
can see that by the way they treat her. But they'll tell
you anything. But they got to know in their heart. I
believe West loved his wife. And Bubba Boy loved his
woman. Them's the only two people I can say found
love. The rest of us play at it. That's cause love cost.
Love got a price to it. Everybody don't want to pay.
They put it on credit. Time it come due they got it on
credit somewhere else. That's the way I see the world.
That's what I done learned all these years.
(WOLF enters.)
---
## WOLF:
It look like Hong Kong out there. I didn't know
there was that many niggers in Pittsburgh. If you drive
by you'd swear didn't nobody have no home. They all
out there on the street.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
The people out there looking for opportunity.
Whatever's out there in the way of opportunity', sooner
or later it's got to pass through. You can't find out what's
out there sitting at home.
(To ---
## WOLF:
)
Why ain't you home? Talking about the people. You
just come in from out there.
---
## WOLF:
I got business to take care of. I can't take care of
it sitting at home.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
That's what I'm trying to tell you. You can't
separate yourself from everybody else. The people out
there trying to figure out how they gonna eat. It's day


off on the plantation. They waiting for the white man to
call them back to work.
---
## WOLF:
I went over there to see Hambone. West got him
laid out real nice. He look like he sleeping. You been
over, Sterling?
---
## STERLING:
I just left from over there.
---
## WOLF:
Don't he look real nice and peaceful? Look like he
sleeping.
---
## STERLING:
He look like he dead to me. I sat there awhile.
I signed the book. Ain't but three or four people signed
it
---
## WOLF:
I signed it. I see Holloway signed it. Risa, you going
over?
---
## RISA:
No I don't want to see him like that.
---
## WOLF:
I saw you all down at the rally last night. Wasn't
that something? Everybody was down there. Even the
niggers that swear up and down on two stacks of Bibles
that they ain't black they was down there. Ain't
had but five hundred chairs and three thousand people.
Wasn't no fight or nothing. It was real nice.
---
## STERLING:
The police was down there taking people's
pictures.
---
## WOLF:
I seen that. Wasn't that something? They don't go
out there where the white folks at and take their pictures.
---
## STERLING:
I smiled when they took mine.
---
## WOLF:
I was standing down there watching that drugstore.
It's still smoking from the fire last night. They ain't put
it out yet. They must have had every fire truck in the
world down there. Did you all see that? It wasn't nothing
but a little old drugstore. Had ten, eleven fire trucks and
near about a hundred police. Say it started in the back
by the alley. A couple of people seen some of them black
power niggers around there.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
That ain't nothing but talk. Everybody know
the man burned down his own store so he could get the
insurance. That's the only way he get anything out of it.
If he pack up and leave he don't get nothing. This way
he get paid for everything all his stock his build-
ing everything. That's the best way to sell a business
don't nobody want to buy. Sell it to the insurance com-
pany. All them niggers standing down there watching the
fire they don't know but somebody's going to
jail. The police got to snatch one of them. That way the
insurance company pay quicker. Meyer's gonna walk
away with two hundred thousand dollars and somebody
going to jail for three years. See if I ain't right. You
watch over the next two or three days and see if they
don't arrest somebody as he walking by there. Meyer's
gonna be down there in Florida playing golf and laying
on the beach and the fire inspector's gonna be right
there with him. That's the way it works in America.
---
## WOLF:
You right about that. It's hard to live in America.
Did you all hear where Petey Brown killed his old lady
last night? Caught her in the Ellis Hotel with his best
friend. Killed him too. That's why I don't have no one
woman. When I die every woman in Pittsburgh gonna
cry. They ain't gonna know what to do with themselves.
My woman come and told me she had another man. I


told her say, "Alright, baby, but he can't hear and he
can't see. He can't see like I do. You got to be able to
pull a whole lot of boxcars to keep up with me." I'm
like Prophet Samuel if a man can get him seven
women if he can find seven women want to be with
him let him have them seven and one or two more.
Seven women wanna lay down with him must see some-
thing they like. Hell, it's hard to get one, let alone seven.
It's hard to get one you can trust that far. See, when
you lay down with her, you trusting her with your life.
Yo u lay down you got to close your eyes. It wouldn't be
nothing for somebody to walk up and slit your throat.
That's why you lock the door at night. You lock the door
and it be just you and her. That's a whole lot of trust there.
If I had that I wouldn't give it up for nothing. Other than
that when I die every woman in Pittsburgh gonna cry.
(WEST enters.)
---
## HOLLOWAY:
Hey, West.
---
## WOLF:
Mr. West himself!
---
## WEST:
How you doing, Holloway? Hey, Risa, give me a
cup of coffee. Memphis ain't come back yet?
---
## HOLLOWAY:
I hope he didn't go down there and act a fool to
where they had to lock him up. The courthouse been closed.
---
## STERLING:
Say, Mr. West I just wanna tell you you
did a good job on Hambone. I just wanna tell you that.
---
## WEST:
I got him laid out there for two hours tonight
just in case anybody wanna see him then I'm gonna
take him on out there and bury him tomorrow. Lutz
come by to see him after he closed his store.


---
## RISA:
Lutz gonna rot in hell.
---
## WOLF:
Lutz gonna go to hell with a ham under each arm.
---
## RISA:
You want some coffee, Sterling?
---
## STERLING:
Yeah, give me a cup.
---
## WEST:
Let me get some sugar, Risa.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
Things done quieted down over there now
with Prophet Samuel gone.
---
## WEST:
It took seven hours to bury him.
---
## HOLLOWAY:
Hey, West, tell him that wasn't nothing
like Patchneck Red.
---
## WEST:
I ain't never seen nothing like that. The way them
people carried on it was sinful. I buried that boy
Begaboo but it wasn't nothing like that. There was just
as many people, but they was respectful. Them niggers
come to bury Patchneck Red act like it was a party.
---
## STERLING:
Here's your twenty dollars, Wolf. Hey, Risa
hold this for me.
---
## RISA:
What's that?
---
## STERLING:
That's my money. All five hundred and sixty-
two dollars of it. Hold it for me I'll be right back.
(STERLING exits.)


---
## WOLF:
Risa, what's going on with you and Sterling? Some-
thing going on. Don't get me wrong now, I ain't said
nothing wrong with it. You know me. I live and let live.
I think it's nice.
---
## RISA:
Wolf, ain't nobody paying you no mind.
---
## WOLF:
Naw, Sterling's alright with me. He act kind of crazy
sometime. But he alright with me. I think it's nice.
(MEMPHIS enters, singing. He has been drinking.)
---
## MEMPHIS:

We don't care what Mama don't allow
We gonna barrelhouse anyhow
Hey Hey Holloway. You know the Brass Rail
down there by the courthouse? Man they got a bar-
maid down there you can stand up right next to Risa. She
gonna wait on me till I come back. She down there now.
I told her I'll be back. She get off at seven o'clock. I left
the courthouse, stopped down there and got me a few
drinks. Hey hey Risa, fix me something to eat.
Holloway I took that twenty dollars and threw it in
the river right down there in the Monongahela
River. I went and stood on the Brady Street Bridge
I didn't just let it drop. I took and tied a rock around
it and threw it just like Aunt Ester say. She told me
if I do that everything be alright. And she was right too.
She told me, "If you can't fight the fire, don't mess with
it." Only I'm ready to fight it now. Hey, West look
here I went down there to the courthouse ready to
fight for that twenty-five thousand dollars I want for my
property. I wasn't taking no fifteen. I wasn't taking no


twenty. I want twenty-five thousand. They told me, "Well,
Mr. Lee . we got a clause, and the city is prepared to
put into motion"—that's the part I like, "prepared to put
into motion"—"the securing of your property at sixteen
twenty-one Wylie Avenue"--they had the address right
and everything—"for the sum of thirty-five thousand dol-
lars." I liked to fell over. The lawyer standing there, he
know I'm mad and he ready to fight it. I told him, "Don't
you say a word. Don't you open your mouth." Thirty-five
thousand dollars! I started to go up and tell my wife. She
up there. She up there at the house. She come back to get
her things and ended up staying. I moved out. She moved
back in and I moved out. Told her I had something to do
and if she be there when I get back—if I get back—then we
can sit down and talk. You know what I'm gonna do? Aunt
Ester clued me on this one. I went up there and told her my
whole life story. She say, "If you drop the ball, you got to go
back and pick it up. Ain't no need in keeping running, cause
if you get to the end zone it ain't gonna be a touchdown."
She didn't say it in them words but that's what she meant.
To l d me "You got to go back and pick up the ball."
That's what I'm gonna do. I'm going back to Jackson and
see Stovall. If he ain't there, then I'm gonna see his son. He
enjoying his daddy's benefits he got to carry his daddy's
weight. I'm going on back up to Jackson and pick up the ball.
(He notices the sign on the menu board.)
"Funeral for Hambone Saturday One O'Clock." 
Hambone dead? 
---
He dead?
---
## RISA:
He died in his sleep.
---
## MEMPHIS:
Lutz never did give him his ham, 
---
did he? 
---
I always figured one day 
---
Lutz would break down 
---
and give it to him. 
---
Either that or he'd take it.
---
He gonna give me my ham. 
---
He gonna give me my ham.

---
and went back to pick it up.

Risa, where's my plate? 
---

---
I'm going on back down there 
--
to the Brass Rail. 
---
Me and me and
---
I forget her name 
---

---
You believe that, Holloway? 
---
Hey, West 
---

---

---

---
I'm gonna open me up 
----

---
right down there on Centre Avenue.

---
and seven or eight waitresses. 
---
