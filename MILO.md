## HOUSE MANAGER:
Good morning, how is everyone doing today?!<br>

---

Welcome to Chicago Children's Theatre and today's performance of "Milo Imagines the World".<br>

---

This is a world-premiere musical<br>

---

which means that you are one of the first audiences to ever see it.<br>

---

The audience is a very important part of theatre!<br>

---

If you see something funny, you can laugh.<br>

---

If you see something surprising, you can give a small gasp.<br>

---

And at the end of songs and when you see something amazing, you can clap.<br>

---

Let's try clapping right now!

---

I think you're ready for the show.

---

Thank you so much for being here,

---

and we'll begin the show right after this pre-show announcement:

---

## RECORDED VOICE:
Welcome to Chicago Children’s Theatre!<br>

---

if you have a cell phone, now is a great time to turn it off, put it on silent,<br>

---

do whatever you need to do to make sure your phone does not disturb the show.<br>

---

And there is absolutely NO taking of photos or videos during the show. <br>

---

Everything around you can become a part of the show, so please be sure to stay in your seat and keep the walkways clear.<br>

---

In case of an emergency, you can head back out the door you entered from. <br>

---

If you have left the theatre, please wait for someone from our team to help you back to your seat.<br>

---

After the show, please ask us about our classes, camps, and school programs.<br>

---

Thanks so much for being here today, now please enjoy the show!<br>

I hate her. I hate her! I hate her!!

## A SCARY STRANGE ADULT:
Hey kid! 

---

## MILO:
Uh… hello. 

---

## A SCARY STRANGE ADULT:
Are you lost? 

---

## MILO:
Uh… no! No, I’m alright–

---

I’m great–I’m fine–waiting for my sister. 

---

## A SCARY STRANGE ADULT:
Okay. 

---

## MILO:
I know exactly where I am! 

---

## A SCARY STRANGE ADULT:
Alright. 

---

## MILO:
I’m not lost! 

---

## A SCARY STRANGE ADULT:
Okaaaaay. 

---

## ANOTHER SCARY STRANGE ADULT:
Hey! Do you need help? 

---

## MILO:
No! No. I’m fine! Not lost. 

---

I totally know where I am. To-ta-lly. Not lost at all. 

---

## ANOTHER SCARY STRANGE ADULT:
Are you sure? 

---

## MILO:
Yes! 

---

No… Adrienne? RiRi? 

---

The ants are back. 

---

Maybe RiRi was right. It is stupid. 

---

She’s probably happy I'm gone. I bet she ain’t even looking for me. 

---

Whatever! I can take care of myself. I don’t need her. 

---

## ADRIENNE:
MILO!

---

Don’t you ever run away from me like that again! Do you hear me? 

---

You hear me?! 
You scared me half to death! 

---

I almost had a heart attack! A heart attack!

---
 
Anything could have happened to you! What if you had gotten on the wrong train or gotten hurt or–or– 

---

I never could have forgiven myself– Milo? 

---

(silence)

---

## ADRIENNE:
Are you listening to me? 

---

Oh, so it’s like that? 

---

You’re just gonna hide from me forever? 

---


Milo? 

---

I know you’re behind there. I can see your foot sticking out. 

---

## MILO:
No, you don’t. 

---

## ADRIENNE:
Listen Milo, I— 
      
---

(train rumbling)

---

## ADRIENNE:
Come on, we gotta go! Hurry! 

---

## SUBWAY RECORDING:
Stand clear of the closing… oh you get it. 

---

## MILO:
This was one of my best drawings. 

---

And you ruined it… You ruined it!

---

Can you see who she is? 

---

Can you see? I’ll give you a hint: 

---

She is a superhero! So strong and so beautiful 

---

The most beautifulest, strongest person in the world.

---

And she tells the best bedtime stories and gives the tightest hugs.

---

And whenever things are tough she is always there to make them better. 

---

Do you get it?? Can you tell who it is? 

---

## ADRIENNE:
(Overlapping) Is it me!?
## MILO:
(Overlapping) It’s mom! 

---

## MILO:
Supermom!

## ADRIENNE:
Okay. Remember to take everything out of your pockets

when you go through the metal detectors. 

---

## ADRIENNE:
And don’t be acting up in here, alright? 

---

## MILO:
Not making any promises.

## ADRIENNE:
Boy! Don’t make me take you home.

Alright, get in line.

Ugh!

## A VOICE OVER THE SPEAKER:
Visiting hours for the final group will begin in 5 minutes.

Wait. Is that…

That’s the king!! <br>

Could he actually be visiting someone here too? Just like me?<br>

Maybe he doesn’t really live in a giant castle with a perfect life like I thought. 

---

Maybe his life is as weird and scary and special as mine.

---

And if I was wrong about that, what else could I have been wrong about? 

---

Maybe the man crying on the train wasn’t crying at all? 

---

Maybe he just had allergies!

We missed you more!

I don’t think so.

## MILO:
Way more!

## MOM:
Nope! Impossible!

And, come here! Have you gotten taller since last week?

## MILO:
I hope so! 

---

## MOM:
No, don’t tell me that. Just stop!

## MILO:
Stop what?

## MOM:
Stop growing! Stay my little Milo forever.

## MILO:
No! 

---

## ADRIENNE:
He’s annoying! 

---

## MILO:
She’s mean! 

---

## ADRIENNE:
He ran away from me in the station! 

---

## MILO:
She ripped up my drawing!

---

## MOM:
Hey hey hey!

---

## ADRIENNE:
I’ve been dealing with this all day. 

---

He doesn’t listen! He doesn’t pay attention!

## MOM:
Come here, Ri.

## ADRIENNE:
He’s always–

---

## MOM:
Ri. Come here.

---

Thank you.

## MILO:
Hey! No hugging without me!

---

## MOM:
Listen to me. You two have to listen to each other. 

---

## MILO:
Why do I have to listen to her?

---

She’s always fussing and yelling at me!

---

## ADRIENNE:
He’s a brat! Why would I listen to him? 

---

## MOM:
Because all you have is each other. 

---

## MOM:
What are you imagining now?

---

## MILO:
It's a surprise!

---

## MOM:
Oh, a surprise?

---

## MILO:
Yep. A surprise for you.

---

## ADRIENNE:
A new Supermom picture?

---

## MILO:
Mmmmhmm. And it’s even better than the last one! 

---

## MILO:
No peeking! 

---

## MOM:
Okay Okay!!

## MILO:
I’m almost done! Never disturb an artist at work!

## MILO:
VOILA!

---

## MOM:
Milo, it’s perfect. 

---

## MILO:
You like it? 

---

## MOM:
No. I love it! 

---

## MILO:
This is me in the middle with the cool glasses. 

---

That’s Adrienne there in the pink and that’s you. 

---

And we’re eating ice cream on a Sunday afternoon. 

---

## MOM:
It’s beautiful. 

---

## ADRIENNE:
Wait, where is Supermom? Shouldn’t she be somewhere in her fancy hero suit saving the day? 

---

## MILO:
I thought this was better. 

---

## VOICE OVER THE SPEAKER:
3 minutes left of the visiting hour.

---

(silence)


---

## ADRIENNE:
What are you doing? 

---

## MOM:
I’m sitting on the porch eating a chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream cone, duh! What are you doing? 

---

## MILO:
Ooo Ooo I’m eating strawberry! 

---

## ADRIENNE:
But I wanted strawberry! 

---

## MILO:
Well too bad. I got it first!

## ADRIENNE:
I’m the oldest!

---

## ADRIENNE:

---

## MOM:
Just saying. 

---

## ADRIENNE:
Fine, fine, I'll have chocolate. 

---

## MILO:
Boring.

---

## ADRIENNE:
How dare you? Chocolate is not boring! It’s... sophisticated. 

---

(birds chirping, breeze blowing)

---

## MILO:
I can’t wait ‘til we can do this for real. 

---

## ADRIENNE:
With real ice cream.

## MOM:
And with a real breeze.

## VOICE OVER THE SPEAKER:
One minute until the end of visiting hours. 

---

## MOM:
Alright, babies…

## MILO:
I don’t want to go.

## ADRIENNE:
We’ll be back next week.
