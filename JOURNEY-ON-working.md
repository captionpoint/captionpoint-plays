TOD: (loosely: ) Welcome to JOURNEY ON! Theater Latté Da’s Cabaret Celebration of their 100th show! A journey that started in 1998 and brings us all the way to… tonight! You! Us! And this! Welcome! I think we’re gonna have a really good time.

My name is Tod Petersen, and I’ll be your journeyman host for this evening. We’ll be making some quick stops along the way to share some of the history of the company but the real reason for tonight’s celebration is to share some of the iconic music that has defined us. Every song you’ll hear tonight will be from one of the 99 shows produced by Latté Da.

That last song, “Coffee in a Cardboard Cup” was actually the very first song, from the very first show, from BEFORE our very first season. BEFORE Latté Da even had a name!

Okay, the name thing… How did a top notch professional theater company known for elegant, rigorous, innovative takes on musical theater come to be named after… coffee? Well before anyone had an inkling about the full talents and artistic vision of our founding directors Peter Rothstein and Denise Prosek, they were just two old high school buddies trying to put on little cabarets in, you guessed it, coffee shops! So there you go. Theater! Latte! Ta Da!

And when the name was in place, what shows did Latté Da produce that very first season? Well I’m so glad you asked! OH, S#!% I’M TURNING INTO MY MOTHER was a show we put together, where I played my mother, my father, my siblings, and even myself as an 11-year old trying for his first play…

YOUNG TOD: My name is Tod Petersen, 108 East Glencrest Drive, Mankato. For my tryouts for the play I would just like to sing “You Made Me Love You” by my all-time favorite actress of all time, Judy Garland. Hit it, Bradley!
♪

YOUNG TOD: Dear Missus Garland, I am singing this to you,
(mumbled) And I hope that you will read it so you know,
My heart beats like a hammer,
And I stutter and I stammer
Every time I see you on the picture show.
I guess I’m just another fan of yours,
So I thought I’d sing and tell you so.

You made me love you 
I didn’t want to do it 
I didn’t want to do it
 
You made me want you 
And all the time you knew it 
I guess you always knew it
 
You made me happy sometimes 
You made me glad 
But there were times, dear, 
You made me feel so bad
 
You made me sigh for 
I didn’t want to tell you 
I didn’t want to tell you
 
I want some love that’s true 
Yes, I do, indeed I do 
You know I do
 
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme what I cry for 
You know you’ve got the brand of kisses 
That I’d die for 
You know you made me love you.


TOD: From the very start, Theater Latté Da was all about creating new work. OH, S#!%, I’M TURNING INTO MY MOTHER was born in Peter and Denise’s hometown of Grand Rapids, Minnesota (also the birthplace of Judy Garland, something in the water!). Peter used to host Judy Garland weekends at his family’s cabin and would invite a bunch of us up and we’d swim and boat and eat and go to the Judy Garland museum and on Saturday nights we’d have the Judy Garland Talent Show (where everybody was a winner) and I sang “You Made Me Love You” and did a few imitations of my mother (My name ain’t baby. It’s Carole. Mrs Petersen if you're nasty). Peter’s sweet mother Jean got a total kick out of the mother stuff and it was there that Peter clicked on the idea of producing a mother-themed show, where we would talk about our mothers and sing about our mothers and make fun of our mothers. (Sorry, mom!)

Latté Da didn’t have a home theater yet so Peter booked a string of late night performances of OH, $#!% on the set of a halloween-themed show at the Loring Playhouse. Which is now an office space near Loring Park. Which kind of breaks my heart.

The Loring became Latté Da’s permanent home in 1999 and that’s when the company as we know it today started to take shape:  a mix of new works created by local artists (OH, $#%!), small scale operas (LA BOHÈME), new takes on both well-known musicals (GYPSY, SUNDAY IN THE PARK) and lesser-known musicals (FLOYD COLLINS, A MAN OF NO IMPORTANCE), and musical revues (like LOST IN BOSTON)...
[ERIN ad libs, reminisces about her first show being EVITA after being encouraged by the late, great Michael Matthew Ferrell, and introduces the next selection as coming from the very first official Latté Da show, season one.]

♪

ERIN: When I was a girl I had a favorite storyOf the meadowlark who lived where the rivers wind.Her voice could match the angels’ in its glory—But she was blind, the lark was blind.
An old king came and took her to his palaceWhere the walls were burnished bronze and golden braid,And he fed her fruit and nuts from an ivory chalice,And he prayed:
“Sing for me, my meadowlark,Sing for me of the silver morning,Set me free, my meadowlark,And I’ll buy you a priceless jewelAnd cloth of brocade and crewel,And I’ll love you for life,If you will sing for me.”

Then one day as the lark sang by the water,The god of the sun heard her in his flight,And her singing moved him so,He came and brought her the gift of sight.He gave her sight,And she opened her eyes to the shimmer and the splendorOf this beautiful, young god, so proud and strong.And he called to the lark in a voice both rough and tender:“Come along.

Fly with me, my meadowlark,Fly with me on the silver morning,Past the sea where the dolphins bark.We will dance on the coral beaches,Make a feast of the plums and peaches,Just as far as your vision reaches—Fly with me.”

But the meadowlark said no,For the old king loved her so.She couldn’t bear to wound his pride.So the sun god flew away,And when the king came down that day,He found his meadowlark had died.Every time I heard that part I cried… 

And now I stand here starry-eyed and stormy—Oh, just when I thought my heart was finally numb—A beautiful, young man appears before me,Singing: “Come, oh, won’t you come?”And what can I do if finally for the first timeThe one I’m burning for returns the glow?If love has come at last it’s picked the worst time.Still I know—I’ve got to go.

Fly away, meadowlark,Fly away in the silver morning,If I stay, I’ll grow to curse the dark.So it’s off where the days won’t bind me,I know I leave wounds behind me,But I won’t let tomorrow find meBack this way.Before my past once again can blind me—Fly away… 
And we won’t waitTo say goodbye—My beautiful young man and I.

♪

Quando me’n vo’
Quando me’n vo’ soletta per la via,
la gente sosta e mira
e la bellezza mia tutta ricerca in me
da capo a piè … 

Ed assaporo allor la bramosia
sottil, che da gli occhi traspira
e dai palesi vezzi intender sa
alle occulte beltà.
Così l’effluvio del desìo tutta m’aggira,
felice mi fa!

E tu che sai, che memori e ti struggi
da me tanto rifuggi?
So ben:
Le angoscie tue non le vuoi dir,
ma ti senti morir!

[FELIX ad libs, explains that the last song came from Puccini’s LA BOHÈME, which Latté Da has produced a number of times. He reminisces about being an opera singer who often felt out of place in a musical theater room, and often felt too musical theater for an opera room. His first show here, JOHNNY SKEEKY, his favorite Puccini opera, made him feel like he could be his full self, finally.]

[KIM ad libs, reminisces about having a conversation years ago where she named SPELLING BEE as one of her all-time favorite shows, and a friend encouraging her to audition for Latté’s Da’s production. She did, she got it. And she’s been in love with Latté Da ever since.]

[RONNIE ad libs, reminisces about his time performing in his first show, MERRILY WE ROLL ALONG, and the cast barely containing themselves when castmate CHARLIE CLARK’s mustache kept falling off. He introduces the next song as coming from the very first BOOK musical Latté Da ever did.]

♪

BRADLEY: People may hurt us.
We can take it.
Here comes a bad day.
We can shake it.
I’m with you.
You’re with me.
We can make it.
Some little quarrel,
We’ll get through it.
Love isn’t easy.
We can do it.
You and me.
Wait and see.
We can make it.
Long as I know you’re trying.
Long as I know you care.
Long as we pull together,
We can do anything, anytime, anywhere.

I have you.
You have me.
We can make it.
If when we face forever you’re never less than mine.
We can make it fine.

I have you.
You have me.
We can make it.
They never built a tower we were too weak to climb.
Long as we pull together, 
We’ll take on anything, anywhere, anytime.
I have you.
You have me.
We can make it.
Right to the end of always,
Down to the finish line.
We can make it “fine”.

EVAN: We depart on our journey when lights dim to black.
Such a magical start to a story.

KIM: We all gasp when the hero’s resolve starts to crack.
And then cheer when restored to its glory.

RONNIE: Feel the music awaken emotion.
Watch the actors in motion.
A new show dawns.

ALL: With the audience rapt, there is no turning back; 
Journey on.

♪

FELIX: (spoken: ) I’m ready now, Lord. I wanna ask you something…”
(sung: ) Is it warm? Is it soft against your face?
Do you feel a kind of grace inside the breeze?
Will there be trees? Is there light?
Does it hover on the ground?
Does it shine from all around or just from you?

Is it endless and empty and you wander on your own?
Slowly forget about the folks that you have known?
Water’s rising, bread fill up the air
From mopping kitchens everywhere
Familiar faces far as you can see, like a family?

Do we live? Is it like a little town?
Do we get to look back down at who we love?
Are we above? Are we everywhere?
Are we anywhere at all?
Do we hear a trumpet call us and we’re by your side?

Will I want, will I wish
For all the things that I should have done?
Longing to finish what I only just begun?

Or has a shiny truth been waiting there
For all the questions everywhere?
In a world of wondering, suddenly you know;
And you will always know…

Will my mama be there waiting for me?
Smiling like the ways she does
And holding out her arms
And she calls my name?
She will hold me just the same…

Only Heaven knows how glory goes,
What each of us was meant to be.
In the starlight, that is what we are.

I can see so far…
TOD: As Latté Da’s reputation grew, we began to outgrow the Loring Playhouse so Peter and Denise decided to… take the show on the road! Over time there have been splashy transfers to the Fifth Ave in Seattle, Asolo Rep in Sarasota, Geva in upstate New York and in 2019, ALL IS CALM performed off-Broadway, winning a prestigious Drama Desk Award for Unique Theatrical Experience.
I know! Thank you! I had nothing to do with it!
In the early days there were many local partnerships and collaborations such as with Interact Center, Six Points, Arena Dances, VocalEssence, and venues: the Southern Theater, History Theatre, the old Ordway McKnight space, The Pantages and even the University of Minnesota – which is where we produced the beautiful, heartbreaking SPRING AWAKENING…
DEIDRE: Mama who bore me.
Mama who gave me
No way to handle things.
Who made me so sad.
Mama, the weeping.
Mama, the angels.
No sleep in Heaven, or Bethlehem.
Some pray that, one day,
Christ will come a’-calling.
They light a candle,
And hope that it glows.
And some just lie there, crying
For Him to come and find them.
But when He comes, they don’t know how to go…

Mama who bore me.
Mama who gave me
No way to handle things.
Who made me so bad.
Mama, the weeping.

[EVAN ad libs, reminisces about his big break. When he moved 10 years ago, he was having a difficult time breaking into the theater scene. His friends encouraged him to audition for Latté Da because it’s where the actor-singers were hired. He booked a general audition, earned a callback for SWEENEY TODD, finagled his way into an ALL IS CALM audition and earned another callback, then received an email asking him to audition for the world premier of C. Then he received an email saying that he booked, not one, not two, but all three.]

EVAN: I don’t want to standOn the stage with a sword.I went to a pantomime once.I was bored.I’m not a poetical sort of a person like you.When I need a poem,The streets and the gutters will do.

There’s Tommy Flanagan who lights the gas lamps,A hundred ninety lamps in Phoenix Park alone.He’s done it drunk for over fifty-seven yearsIn Dublin!
And down on Henry street is Mad John Maher,Old Ramblin’ Johnny with a face like hammer meat,But Johnny’s singin’ brings a Dublin man to tears.
I don’t knowThe words to tell you how it feelsOr how to put it in a rhyme,But if you come with me you’ll knowHow the lamps in the parkLook like God in the darkAs they glowOn the streets of Dublin.

The dealers hawkin’ and the dockers yellin’,The buskers bangin’ and the ragmen ringin’ bells.And there’s Maureen whose door is always open forAll Dublin!
And Tony Kiely with his racing pigeons.It’s like religion how he lives to fly those birds.He swears they travel for a hundred miles or more.
I don’t knowThe kind of words that you might say,But I can put it my own way,And if you come with me you’ll knowThat those birds on the wingAre a beautiful thingAs they blowThrough the streets of Dublin.

And there’s music like nothin’ you’ve heard,If you know the right jukebox to play.There are glasses to raise in the praiseOf survivin’ the day… 
Down whereMiss Kitty Farrelly is pourin’ whiskeyAnd Frankie Donahughe is lightin’ her cigar.A smoky den where workin’ men don’t bring the wife.
It’s the laughter of fellas with stories to tell,Men who love to get drunk and raise true feckin’ hell!
Ah, you come out with me and you’ll see what you’re missin’ in life
On the Streets of Dublin.

DEIDRE & FELIX: On the streets of Dublin…

ISA & RONNIE: On the streets of Dublin…
ERIN: On the streets of Dublin…

EVAN: On the streets of Dublin.

DEIDRE & FELIX: On the streets of Dublin…

TOD: Latté Da has done GYPSY twice – and I was in both of them! First at the Loring in 2006 with Latté Da favorite Jody Briskey as Rose and then at the Pantages in 2016 with mother/daughter firecrackers Michelle Barber and Cat Brindisi. I’ll always remember the end of Act 1, Herbie holding Louise, watching Mama Rose, Michelle, absolutely tearing up “Ev’rything’s Coming Up Roses”. Best seat in the house.

Strangers sharing the beginnings of a journey

Journey on.

RONNIE: I see his face.
I hear his heartbeat.
I look in those eyes.
How wise they seem.
Well, when he is old enough,
I will show him America
And he will ride
On the wheels of a dream…

We’ll go down South

DEIDRE: Go down South.

RONNIE: And see your people.

DEIDRE: See my folks.

RONNIE: Won’t they take to him

DEIDRE: They’ll take to him

RONNIE: Like cats to cream!

DEIDRE: Mmm

RONNIE: Then we’ll travel on from there…

DEIDRE: California or who knows where!

BOTH: And we will ride
On the wheels of a dream…

RONNIE: Yes, the wheels are turning for us, girl,
And the times are starting to roll.
Any man can get where he wants to
If he’s got some fire in his soul.
We’ll see justice, Sarah,
And plenty of men
Who will stand up
And give us our due,
Oh, Sarah, it’s more than promises.
Sarah, it must be true…

A country that let’s a man like me
Own a car, raise a child, build a life with you…
With you…

DEIDRE: With you…

BOTH: Beyond that road,
Beyond this lifetime,
That car full of hope
Will always gleam!
With the promise of happiness.
And the freedom he’ll live to know.
He’ll travel with head held high
Just as far as his heart can go
And he will ride,
Our son will ride
On the wheels of a dream.

TOD: Well we’re practically at the halfway point of tonight’s journey. One more showstopper before it’s time to have a snack, take a stretch. While on your break, maybe ask yourselves… Which Latté Da show has been your favorite, your most memorable. There’s a memory bowl in the lobby that you can write yours and pop it into.
Which performers do you remember most fondly? I think back: Jody Briskey, Zoe Pappas, Ann Michels, Dieter Bierbrauer from the early years. Choreographers Michael Matthew Ferrell and Kelli Foster Warder. Designers Kate Sutton Johnson, Michael Hoover, Jen DeGolier. Our stage managers and crew, musical directors and instrumentalists, the dedicated TLD staff, Board, Front of House, volunteers. I speak for us all when I say we are a lucky lucky band of artists, so grateful for the opportunities Latté Da has given us. “Don’t Cry for Us, Minnesota.”

ERIN: It won’t be easy, you’ll think it strange
When I try to explain how I feel
That I still need your love after all that I’ve done
You won’t believe meAll you will see is a girl you once knew
Although she’s dressed up to the nines
At sixes and sevens with you

I had to let it happen, I had to change
Couldn’t stay all my life down at heel
Looking out of the window, staying out of the sun
So I chose freedom
Running around trying ev’rything new
But nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it to

Don’t cry for me, Argentina
The truth is, I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don’t keep your distance

And as for fortune
And as for fame
I never invited them in
Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired
They are illusionsThey’re not the solutions they promised to be
The answer was here all the time
I love you and hope you love me.

Don’t cry for me, Argentina

Don’t cry for me, Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don’t keep your distance

Have I said too much?
There’s nothing more I can think of to say to you
But all you have to do is look at me to know
That ev’ry word is true.

Don’t cry for me, Argentina.

DEIDRE & ERIN & ISA & KIM: It’s just a noisy hall where’s there’s a nightly brawl

EVAN & FELIX & BRADLEY & FELIX: If she’d hear her baby’s queer

ALL: And/for all that… tsss ts ts tsss ts ts…

DEIDRE: No, I’m no one’s wife, but
Oh, I love my life

ALL: And all that jazz.
That jazz!

TOD: So we’ve set sail on Act Two. And the time has finally come to pay tribute to a very key artist in the Latté Da story. A true genius. Any guesses? Yes, Stephen Sondheim. You didn’t think we’d go a full night without some Sondheim, did you?! Of the 12 major Broadway musicals he wrote music and lyrics for, Latté Da has produced 8. Let’s see if we can list them all. Major Broadway Sondheims. Music and lyrics?

---

---
The earliest ones we did were SUNDAY, SWEENEY and… COMPANY…
KIM: Bless this day, pinnacle of life,
Husband joined to wife
The heart leaps up to behold
This golden day.

EVAN: Today is for Amy,
Jamie, I give you the rest of my life
To cherish and to keep you, to honor you forever
Today is for Amy,
My happily soon-to-be wife

ISA: Pardon me, is everybody there? Because if everybody′s there
I wanna thank you all for coming to the wedding.
I’d appreciate your going even more,
I mean, you must have lots of better things to do
And not a word of this to Paul. Remember Paul? You know,
The man I′m gonna marry, but I’m not
Because I wouldn’t ruin anyone as wonderful as he is;
But I thank you all for the gifts and the flowers.
Thank you all, now it′s back to the showers.
Don′t tell Paul, but I’m not getting married today.
Listen, everybody, look,
I don′t know what you’re waiting for – A wedding?
What′s a wedding? It’s a prehistoric ritual
Where ev’rybody promises fidelity forever
Which is maybe the most horrifying word I ever heard, and
Which is followed by a honeymoon, where suddenly he′ll realize he’s
Saddled with a nut, and wanna kill me, which he should, so listen,
Thanks a bunch, but I’m not getting married,
Go have lunch, ′cause I′m not getting married,
You’ve been grand, but I′m not getting married,
Don’t just stand there, I′m not getting married,
And don’t tell Paul, but I′m not getting married today!
Go! Can’t you go? Why is nobody listening?
Goodbye! Go and cry at some other person’s wake.
If you′re quick, for a kick, you could pick up a christening,
But please, on my knees, there′s a human life at stake.
Look, I didn’t want to have to tell you,
But I may be coming down with hepatitis
And I think I’m gonna faint,
So if you wanna see me faint, I′ll do it happily,
But wouldn’t it be funnier to go and watch a funeral?
So thank you for the twenty-seven dinner plates and
Thirty-seven butterknives and forty-seven paperweights and
Fifty-seven candleholders… 
One more thing – I am not getting married…
But I′m not getting married…
Still, I’m not getting married…
See, I′m not getting married,
Let us pray that we’re not getting married today!


RONNIE: Someone to hold you too close,
Someone to hurt you too deep,
Someone to sit in your chair,
To ruin your sleep,
To make you aware of being alive,
Being alive.
Someone to need you too much,
Someone to know you too well,
Someone to pull you up short,
To put you through hell,
To give you support is being alive,
Being alive,
Being alive.
Someone you have to let in,
Someone whose feelings you spare,
Someone who like it or not,
Will want you to share
A little, a lot,
Is being alive,
Someone to crowd you with love,
Someone to force you to care.
Someone to make you come through,
Who’ll always be there,
As frightened as you of being alive.
Make me alive,
Make me alive,
Make me alive,
Make me confused,
Mock me with praise,
Let me be used,
Vary my days.
But alone is alone,
Not alive.
Somebody crowd me with love,
Somebody force me to care.
Somebody let come through,
I’ll always be there
As frightened as you, to help us survive
Being alive,
Being alive,
Being alive!
	

BRADLEY: Attend the tale of Sweeney Todd.

ERIN: His skin was pale and his eye was odd.

FELIX: He shaved the faces of gentlemen

KIM: Who never thereafter were heard of again.

DEIDRE: He trod a path that few have trod.

EVAN: Did Sweeney Todd?

ALL: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.

ISA: He kept a shop in London Town

RONNIE: Of fancy clients and good renown.

ERIN: And what if none of their souls were saved?

BRADLEY: They went to their Maker impeccably shaved

DEIDRE & ISA & KIM: By Sweeney,

EVAN & FELIX & RONNIE: By Sweeney Todd,

ALL: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.

ALL: Swing your razor wide, Sweeney,
Hold it to the skies!
Freely flows the blood of those
Who moralize.

BRADLEY & EVAN & FELIX & RONNIE: By Sweeney,

ALL: By Sweeney Todd,
The Demon Barber of Fleet Street!

BRADLEY: I feel you, Johanna,
I feel you.
I was half convinced I’d waken,
Satisfied enough to dream you.
Happily I was mistaken,
Johanna!
I’ll steal you, Johanna,
I’ll steal you.
Do they think that walls can hide you?
Even now, I’m at your window.
I am in the dark beside you,
Buried sweetly in your yellow hair…

FELIX: Nothing’s gonna harm you,
Not while I’m around.
Nothing’s gonna harm you, no sir,
Not while I’m around.
Demons are prowling ev’rywhere nowadays.
I’ll send ’em howling,
I don’t care… I got ways.
No one’s gonna hurt you,
No one’s gonna dare.
Others can desert you,
Not to worry, whistle, I’ll be there!
Demons’ll charm you with a smile, for a while,
But in time… 
Nothing can harm you,
Not while I’m around.

BRADLEY: I feel you, Johanna,

FELIX: Nothing’s gonna harm you,
Not while I’m around.

BRADLEY: I feel you…

FELIX: Nothing’s gonna harm you, no sir,
Not while I’m around.
Demons are prowling ev’rywhere nowadays.

BRADLEY: I was half convinced I’d waken,
Satisfied enough to dream you.

FELIX: I’ll send ‘em howling, I don’t care, I got ways.

BRADLEY: Happily I was mistaken,
Johanna!
I’ll steal you, Johanna… 

FELIX: No one’s gonna hurt you,
No one’s gonna dare.

BRADLEY: I’ll steal you… Johanna… Johanna…

FELIX: Others can desert you,
Not to worry, whistle, I’ll be there!
Demons’ll charm you with a smile, for a while,
But in time…
Nothing can harm you, not while I’m around.

BRADLEY: Buried in your yellow hair.


TOD: (spoken: ) Order. Design.
Tension. Balance. Harmony.

OCTET: (sung: ) Sunday,
By the blue purple yellow red water
On the green purple yellow red grass,
Let us pass through our perfect park,
Pausing on a Sunday

BRADLEY & RONNIE: By the cool blue triangular

OCTET: Water

BRADLEY & RONNIE: On the soft green elliptical grass

OCTET: As we pass through arrangements of shadows
Towards the verticals of trees
Forever…

EVAN & ISA: By the blue purple yellow red water
On the green orange violet mass

OCTET: Of the grass

ALL: In our perfect park,

TOD: Made of flecks of light
And dark,

EVAN & FELIX: And parasols.

TOD: Bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum

ISA & KIM: People strolling through the trees

ISA & KIM & RONNIE & BRADLEY:  Of a small suburban park

ALL: On an island in the river
On and ordinary Sunday…
Sunday…
Sunday…

[DEIDRE ad libs, reminisces about her first show being HELLO, DOLLY! as an understudy for the title role, never having understudied before. She learned on Opening Night that she was to go on for the entire first week. She was grateful for the opportunity, not of performing Dolly Levi, but for being able to help her fellow company members in their time of need. Jump to a year later, when she was playing the Fairy Godmother in CINDERELLA, and needed to step away from the role to tend to her family. She felt such a profuse sense of support from Latté Da… and so when she thinks about Latté Da, she thinks about community.]


DEIDRE: Before the parade passes by,
I’m gonna get in step while there’s still time left.
Before the parade the parade passes by…
Before the parade passes by,
I’m gonna go and taste Saturday’s high life;
Before the parade passes by,
I’m gonna get some life back into my life.
I’m ready to move out in front,
I’ve had enough of just passing by life;
With the rest of them,
With the best of them,
I can hold my head up high.
For I’ve got a goal again,
I’ve got a drive again,
I’m gonna feel my heart comin’ alive again,
Before the parade passes by.

Look at the crowd up ahead,
Listen and hear that brass harmony growing;
Look at the crowd up ahead,
Pardon me if my old spirit is showing.
All of those lights over there,
Seem to be telling me where I’m going;
When the whistles blow
And the cymbals crash
And the sparklers light the sky.
I’m gonna raise the roof,
I’m gonna carry on,
Gimme an old trombone,
Gimme an old baton,
Before the parade 
Before the parade
Before the parade passes by!

TOD: In 2016, Latté Da became the proud owner of the very space we’re in now, the historic Ritz Theater, which incidentally turns 100 years old this year! 100 productions meets 100 years!
With the Ritz as our permanent home, Latté Da continued a successful run of reimagined classics—HELLO, DOLLY!, CHICAGO, CINDERELLA—as well as supporting the development of brand-new musicals— FIVE POINTS, C., JOHNNY SKEEKY, the upcoming MY ÁNTONIA, and who can forget the landmark TWELVE ANGRY MEN?
EVAN: Being a father is far from a sure thing.
It’s never too easy at all.
They run and they win and they climb and they fall.
You need them to know how to choose the mature thing:
Get back up and brush off their knees.

TOD: You tell’em, “be a big man…”

RONNIE: “Just don’t stop climbing trees…”
EVAN: See, it’s never easy at all.

FELIX: Hang on… let go… teach more than you know.

BRADLEY: Through his ev’ry endeavor, remember, whatever you do…

RONNIE & EVAN & TOD & BRADLEY: He’s watching you, Pop!

FELIX: It’s true. My father taught me:
“Get right, be polite, bring honor to your fam’ly.”

TOD: “…Your country!”

RONNIE: “Go get ’em, tiger!”

EVAN: “Work hard.”

BRADLEY: “Stand for something.”

RONNIE: “Show some respect.”

BRADLEY: “The devil’s in the details.”

FELIX: “Expect what’s comin’ to ya.”

TOD: “Try not to be a jerk.”

BRADLEY: Years go…

TOD: So slow…

FELIX & EVAN: Then, before you know…

RONNIE: Blinking back at your son, you could find yourself wondering who

EVAN & FELIX & TOD & BRADLEY: Who…

RONNIE: He grew into.

BRADLEY: But, after all, you’re raising a man, not a weak, insecure thing.
So help keep his eye

BRADLEY & EVAN & FELIX & RONNIE: On the ball!

TOD: And hope for the best while he learns by degrees.

FELIX: From Cat in the Hat to the birds and the bees.

EVAN: Although, even so, there are no guarantees…

ALL: …And that’s never easy at all. 


KIM: I’d like to be a princess on a throne,
To have a country I can call my own
And a king
Who’s lusty and requires a fling
With a female thing
Great!

Men will be men
Let me turn on the gas
I saw them in the den with
Marvin grabbing Whizzer’s ass
 
Oh, sure I’m sure, he’s sure he did his best,
I mean he meant to be what he was not,
The things he was are things which I’ve forgot
He’s a queen,
I’m a queen.
Where is my crown?
 
I’m breaking down.
I’m breaking down.
My life is shitty
And my kid seems like an idiot to me,
I mean that’s sick.
I mean he’s great.
It’s me who is the matter,
Talking madder
Than the maddest hatter.
If I repeat one more word,
I swear I’ll lose my brain.
What else should I explain?
Oh yes, it’s true
I can cry on cue
But so can you.

I’m breaking down.
I’m breaking down,
Down, down,
You ask me if it’s fun to cry over nothing,
It is, I’m breaking down,

Now let’s consider what I might do next
I hate admitting I’ve become perplexed.
I’m bereaved.
I’ve cried, I’ve shook, I’ve yelled, I’ve heaved.
I have been deceived.

As enemies go
Whizzer is not so bad.
It’s just he’s so damn happy
That it makes me so damn mad.
I wanna hate him but I really can’t.
It’s like a nightmare how this all proceeds.
I hope that Whizzer don’t fulfill his needs.
“Don’t” is wrong,
Sing along.
What was the noun?
I’m breaking down.
I’m breaking down.
I’ll soon redecorate these stalls
I’d like some padding on the walls,
And also pills.
I wanna sleep.
Sure, things’ll prob’ly worsen,
But it’s not like I’m some healthy person.
 
I’ve rethought my talks with Marv,
And one fact does emerge,
Oh, I think I like his shrink.
So that is why I might turn to drink,
I’m on the brink
 
Of breaking down.
I’m breaking down,
Down, down
I only want to love a man who can love me
Or like me
Or help me…
Help me!
 
Marvin was never mine.
He took his meetings in the boys’ latrine.
I used to cry,
He’d make a scene.
I’d rather die
Than dry-clean
Marvin’s wedding gown.
I’m breaking down.
I’m breaking down.
It’s so upsetting when you’ve found
That what’s rectangular is round.
I mean, it stinks.
I mean he’s queer.
And me, I’m just a freak
Who needs it maybe every other week.

I’ve rethought the fun we’ve had
And one fact does emerge
I’ve played the foolish clown.
The almost virgin who sings this dirge
Is on the verge

Of breaking down,
I’m breaking down,
Down, down.
The only thing that’s breaking up is my family.
 
The only thing that’s breaking up is my family
But me, I’m breaking
Down!

TOD: That song of course is from FALSETTOS, a show that holds a unique place in Latté Da history:  It was the first BOOK musical that Peter and Denise produced together at the Bryan Lake Bowl in 1997. And it was the first show playing exactly two years when Justin Lucero’s artistic leadership began. Justin, along with Associate Artistic Director Elissa Adams, and Managing Director Elisa Spencer-Kaplan, continues Latté Da’s commitment to re-imagining classics, developing new work and—aren’t we all thankful?— tackling the Sondheim canon…
[BRADLEY ad libs, reminisces about having many memories of being on this stage, but would like to share a memory that comes from the 2016 gala, where he was a performer. The Fund-A-Need that year was for fundraising the money for a down-payment for The Ritz building, and the goal was $40,000. Everyone was shocked and touched that within a matter of a few minutes, the tally board has gone right past $40K and past $100,000, enough for the down payment and several mortgage payments. And as a performer who is always putting his all his love for the audience, this was a moment where he saw the audience paying back with their love.]
[ISA ad libs, reminisces about starting out as an audience-admirer and eventually auditioning and being offered two roles last season. Her immigration status was precarious and she was unsure about how things would pan out, but even though she was new to the company, she felt so much support from the company. Her immigration status worked out and she was grateful to be able to perform, including in CINDERELLA. And speaking of CINDERELLA and SONDHEIM…]


ISA: He’s a very smart prince,
He’s a Prince who prepares.
Knowing this time I’d run from him,
He spread pitch on the stairs.
And I’m caught unawares.
And I thought: Well, he cares…
This is more than just malice.
Better stop and take stock
While you’re standing here stuck
On the steps of the palace.

You think, what do you want?
You think, make a decision.
Why not stay and be caught?
You think, well it’s a thought,
What would be his response?
But then what if he knew who you were
When you know that you’re not
What he thinks that he wants?
And then what if you are
What a Prince would envision?
Although how can you know
Who you are ‘til you know
What you want, which you don’t?
So then, which do you pick:
Where you’re safe, out of sight,
And yourself, but where ev’rything’s wrong?
Or where ev’rything’s right
And you know that you’ll never belong?
And whichever you pick,
Do it quick,
‘Cause you’re starting to stick
To the steps of the palace.
It’s your first big decision
The choice isn’t easy to make.
To arrive at a ball is exciting and all,
Once you’re there, though, it’s scary.
And it’s fun to deceive
When you know you can leave,
But you have to be wary.
There’s a lot that's at stake,
But I’ve stalled long enough,
‘Cause I'm still standing stuck
In the stuff on the steps…
Better run along home
And avoid the collision.
Even though they don’t care,
You’ll be better off there
Where there's nothing to choose,
So there’s nothing to lose.
So you pry up your shoes.
Then from out of the blue
And without any guide,
You know what your decision is,
Which is not to decide.
You’ll just leave him a clue:
For example, a shoe.
And then see what he’ll do.
Now it’s he and not you
Who is stuck with a shoe,
In a stew, in the goo,
And you’ve learned something, too,
Something you never knew,
On the steps of the palace.


EVAN: I am nothing,
You are wind and water and sky,
darling.
Tell me, Jody,
How I can earn you love.
I would swim oceans,
I would move mountains,
I would do anything for you.
What do you want me to do?
 
I am unworthy of your love,
Jody, Jody.
Let me prove worthy of your love.
Tell me how I can earn your love,
Set me free.
How can I turn your love to me?
 
I would come take you from your life… 

I would come take you from your cell… 

You would be queen to me, not wife… 

I would crawl belly deep through Hell… 

Baby, I’d die for you… 
Even though…

I will always know:
I am unworthy of your love,
Jody’, darlin’,
Let me prove worthy of your love.
I’ll find a way to earn your love,
Wait and see.
Then you will turn your love to me,
Your love to me…


Loving you is not a choice,
It’s who I am.

Loving you is not a choice
And not much reason to rejoice,
But it gives me purpose,
Gives me voice, to say to the world:
This is why I live.
You are why I live.

Loving you is why I do
The things I do.
Loving you is not in my control.
But loving you, I have a goal
For what’s left of my life… 

I will live,
And I would die for you.


Isn’t it rich?
Are we a pair?
Me here at last on the ground,
You in mid air.
Send in the clowns.
Isn’t it bliss?
Don’t you approve?
One who keeps tearing around,
One who can’t move.
Where are the clowns?
Send in the clowns.
Just when I’d stopped opening doors,
Finally knowing the one that I wanted was yours.
Making my entrance again with my usual flair,
Sure of my lines, no one is there.
Don’t you love farce?
My fault, I fear.
I thought that you’d want what I want.
Sorry, my dear.
But where are the clowns?
Quick, send in the clowns.
Don’t bother, they’re here.

Isn’t it rich,
Isn’t it queer,
Losing my timing this late in my career?
And where are the clowns?
There ought to be clowns.
Well, maybe next year… 



TOD: Latté Da seasons have often been anchored by annual holiday offerings: ALL IS CALM, an emotional coming together of hearts and voices; CHRISTMAS AT THE LOCAL, a neighborly musical celebration of the poetry of Dylan Thomas and Maya Angelou; and A CHRISTMAS CAROLE PETERSEN, the other mother-show Peter, Denise and I put together. A special holiday tribute to our mothers Jean, Gay and Carole. And all mothers.

TOD:  Every year when I would come home for the holidays I would inform my parents that I would NOT be joining them for the Christmas Eve service at church.

(as DAD)  Oh Jesus Christ! Son! It’s Christmas Eve and we’re going to church as a family!

(as TOD)  And every year I would end up going. And every year I would watch a bright-eyed child light the advent candles, illuminating the darkened sanctuary. And every year I would join in singing the traditional carols. And every year I was glad I was there. And every year we’d go home and sit around the artificial tree and the chipped nativity and Mom would say…

(as MOM) Now you may each open ONE gift from your father and me because tomorrow we will open all our presents from S-A-N-T-A.

(as TOD) Mom, I’m a grown man. I still get presents from Santa.

(as MOM) Oh Toddy, please. Stop trying to be such a Scrooge. I know you never believed in Santa Claus.

(as TOD) Yeah. So why all the make-believe? Why the whole magic show?

(as MOM) Because. It brings me joy. Besides. Isn’t that what you do in the theater? Make believe? Make magic?

TOD. And once again, she’s right.

DEIDRE: 
We clap hands and welcome the Peace of Christmas.
We beckon this good season to wait a while with us.
We, Baptist and Buddhist, Methodist and Muslim, say come.
Peace.

Come and fill us and our world with your majesty.

BRADLEY:
We, the Jew and the Jainist, the Catholic and the Confucian,
Implore you, to stay a while with us.
So we may learn by your shimmering light
How to look beyond complexion and see community.

DEIDRE:
It is Christmas time, a halting of hate time.
On this platform of peace, we can create a language
To translate ourselves to ourselves and to each other.

BRADLEY:
At this Holy Instant, we celebrate the Birth of Jesus Christ
Into the great religions of the world.
We jubilate the precious advent of trust.
We shout with glorious tongues at the coming of hope.
All the earth’s tribes loosen their voices
To celebrate the promise of Peace.

DEIDRE:
We, Angels and Mortals, Believers and Non-Believers,
Look heavenward and speak the word aloud. Peace. 

BRADLEY: We look at our world and speak the word aloud. Peace. 

DEIDRE: We look at each other, then into ourselves
And we say without shyness or apology or hesitation.

ALL: Peace,

DEIDRE: My Brother.

ALL: Peace, 

DEIDRE: My Sister.

ALL: Peace, 

DEIDRE: My Soul.


TOD: (with a British accent: ) And then a voice from across the trenches near Polygon Wood; it was Victor Granier of the Paris Opera. The troops: English, French, German, forgot to fire while listening to that wonderful tenor voice.

EVAN: Minuit, chrétiens, c’est l’heure solennelle,Où l’Homme-Dieu descendit jusqu’à nous.Pour effacer la tache originelle
Et de Son Père arrêter le courroux.Le monde entier tressaille d’espéranceEn cette nuit qui lui donne un Sauveur.
Peuple à genoux, attends ta délivrance.Noël, Noël, voici le Rédempteur,Noël, Noël, voici le Rédempteur!

TOD: Well that’s it! It’s been super fun, nostalgic, heartwarming to revisit and celebrate Theater Latté Da’s 99 past productions. What an incredible journey. And there’s a full season of Latté Da’s special brand of music and heart and smarts and beauty coming your way! A special shout-out to our co-Founders, Denise Prosek and Peter Rothstein. Two old friends with a coffee addiction and a dream.

ALL: Hey, old friend,
Are you okay, old friend?
What do you say, old friend?
Are we or are we unique?
Time goes by, ev’rything else keeps changing.
You and I, we get continued next week.
Most friends fade
Or they don’t make the grade.
New ones are quickly made
And in a pinch, sure, they’ll do.
But us, old friend,
What’s to discuss, old friend?
Here’s to us…
Who’s like us?
TOD:
Bradley Greenwald!
Deidre Cochran!
Kim Kivens!
Erin Capello!
Evan Tyler Wilson!
Felix Aguilar Tomlinson!
Ronnie Allen!
Isa Condo-Olvera!
And I’m Tod Petersen!

ALL: But us, old friends,
What’s to discuss, old friends?
Here’s to us!
Who’s like us?
Damn few!
