## NARRATOR:
Chicago Children’s Theatre presents... 

---

A Manual Cinema Production...

---

*Leonardo! A Wonderful Show about a Terrible Monster!*

---

Based on two books by Mo Willems. 

---

Book 1:

---

Leonardo was a terrible monster. He just couldn’t scare anyone. 

---

-Rawwwrrrr!

---

-D’awwww! 

-JUST adorable. 

---

## NARRATOR:
He didn’t have 1,642 teeth like Tony. 

---

He wasn’t big like Eleanor. 

---

And he wasn’t just plain weird, like Hector. 

[weird noises]

---

Leonardo tried very hard to be scary... 

[roars]

---

But he just wasn’t! 

---

He couldn’t scare babies... 

---

-RAWR! 

-[baby giggles] 

---

## NARRATOR:
He couldn’t scare grandmas... 

---

-RAWR! 

-Oh, aren’t you cute! 

---

Oh, look at that little nose. Boop!

---

## NARRATOR:
He couldn’t even scare a little mouse... 

---

[quiet squeaking]

---

-I love cheese... Like gouda. And provolone. And brie! 

---

Uh ohhh! 

---

-Booga Booga Booga! 

---

-Awwwww. Mwwah! You’re adorable. 

---

-I AM NOT ADORABLE! 

-Umm, yes you are. 

---

-YOU’RE ADORABLE!

-SO ARE YOOOOOUUU! OKAY BUH-BYE!

---

-Did you see that? Why can’t I scare anybody? Here, look at this...look, look, look. See, look. 

---

[quirky music]

I’ve got these scarrrry monster horns... that are kind of small. 

---

And, I’ve got these scary monster fangs! Hissss. 

---

Huh. That is NOT what I thought my teeth looked like. 

---

But at least I’ve got these scarrry monster eyes! Yeah. They are red and mean, and... 

---

Oh no! I AM adorable. 

---

Awww, this is the worst! 

---

Hey, stop. Stop wagging like that, it’s too cute! [sighs] 

---

But that doesn’t matter. Looks don’t matter, right? What matters are scaaarrrrrry moves! 

---

I’ve been practicing this one for weeks. You’re gonna be so scared...

---

1, 2, 3... BOOGA BOOGA BOOGA! 

---

Wait, you know what, I said 1, 2, 3. Let me try again and I won’t count.

---

SKIBBIDY DOP BOP AH-DOOOO! 

---

Well, that was just jazz.
One more time, let me try one more time.

---

Gorgle orgle orgle!!!

---

[Thump!]

---

Hey Lily, was anybody scared?

---

## NARRATOR:
Uh, let me check. Hey audience, were you scared? 

---

No, they don’t seem to be very scared.

---

-Aw, rats! 

---

[menacing laughter offscreen]

---

[menacing music playing]

-Hey, Leonardo! Scare anyone lately? 

---

-Um. No. 

---

-I knew it! You couldn’t even scare the audience, Leo-NERD-O! 

-Haha yeah, Leo-NERDO-O! 

---

-[unintelligible] 

---

-Sick burn, Fletcher. Yeah, you are a *terrible* monster. 

---

-...and by that she means not that you are a monster who IS terrible, 

---

but that you’re terrible AT BEING a monster! 

---

-Thanks for clarifying, Brad. 

-Sure thing, Cynthia. 

---

-Yeah, you couldn’t even scare a...a little kitty-cat! 

---

-[unintelligible] 

---

-Haha, you said it, Fletch! Leo-nerd-o couldn’t even scare a SCAREDY-CAT! 

---

[mean laughter, music fades]

---

-I could too scare a scaredy cat!! ...Maybe. 

---

Maybe, if it was the most scaredy-cat kid... in the whole world!

---

## NARRATOR:
That’s when Leonardo had an idea! 

---

[ding!] 
[lo-fi upbeat music playing]

---

-That’s it! I’ll find the most scaredy-cat kid in the whole world... And scare the tuna-salad out of them!

---

RAWRRRR! This is great! I’m so smart. And scary...! 

---

[singing] I’ll look up, down, in and out 
And all around 

---

For the scarediest scaredy-cat kid 
In any town 

---

Scared of their own shadow 
[screams]
Scared of laundry machines 
[screams]

---

I’ll be the most terrible monster 
[roar]
That they’ve ever seen 

---

[synth drum break]

---

To them I’ll be big 
To them I’ll be scary 

---

Big nasty teeth 
Unsettingly hairy 

---

To them I’ll be creepy 
To them I’ll be weird 

---

Big nasty claws 
And a tail to be feared 

---

To them I will lurk in the dark 
and be scary 

---

Leonardo: A True Horror Visionary! 

---

[synth drums, crowd cheers]

---

[cameras shutter]

---

[music continues, bullies groan and gasp]

---

I’ll look up, down, in and out 
And all around 

---

For the scarediest scaredy-cat kid 
[scream]
In any town 

---

Scared of vibrating cell phones 
Scared of lima beans 

---

[kids screaming]
I’ll be the most terrible monster 
that they’ve ever seen 

---

[speaking] Perfect! 

---

## NARRATOR:
Leonardo had the perfect plan.

---

-Yeah, the perfect plan! 

---

## NARRATOR:
There was just one problem...

---

-Yeah! Just one pro- wait, what problem? 

---

## NARRATOR:
Where was he going to find the most scaredy-cat kid in the whole world? 

---

-Where was he going to find the most...? 

---

Oh yeah, I hadn’t thought of that. Huh. 

---

There must be millions of kids in the world. 

And only some of them are scaredy-cats... and only ONE of them is the most scaredy-cat kid in the whole world!

---

What are the odds I am going to find THEM? 

---

If only there was a place I could go for help... 

---

[slide whistle]

-[ominous voice] LIBRARY.

---

-Like a store where they give you knowledge... for free... 

---

-[ominous voice] LIBRARY.

---

-A place I could go for... information... 

---

-[ominous voice] LIBRARY. 

---

-Oh! The Public Library...! Well, OK! 

-[ominous voice] LIBRARY.

---

[funky beat playing]

---

## NARRATOR:
[speaking rhythmically] Now puzzle me this. What do you do when you’re looking for a piece of information? 

---

You might not even be sure exactly what you’re looking for. 

---

We call that a conundrum. 

---

And you might be wondering... 

---

“Do I have to look for this information all by myself?

---

 It seems so hard... and boring... If only there was a...” 

---

## ALL
[singing] PLACE YOU COULD GO...

---

## NARRATOR
[speaking] And people who could help you find... 

---

## ALL
[singing] INFORMATION... 

---

## NARRATOR
[speaking] And especially if you wanted to find the scarediest-cat kid in the whole world so that you could scare the tuna salad out of them! 

---

## ALL
[singing] 
TUNA SALAD!   

---

## NARRATOR
[singing] People, places, colors, and shapes. 
Spelling and science, and outer space. 

---

Things that have been, and things that never were. 
The library has what you’re looking for! 

---

## ALL
[singing]
Library! Find it in the library!

---

## NARRATOR
[speaking] Leonardo and the Librarian searched long into the night for the Most Scaredy-Cat Kid in the Whole World... 

---

They even went to the Scaredy-Cat Electronic Database. 

---

[keyboard clicks]
Who? A kid! 

---

What? A scaredy-cat. 

---

Where? The WHOLE world. 

---

When? Now. 

---

Why? To scare the tuna salad out of them... Search!

---

[dial-up screeching]

Leonardo searched until he found the perfect candidate:

---

## ALL
[harmonizing] Sam! The Most Scaredy-Cat Kid in the whole... WORLD!!! 

---

[drum break]

---

-Oh. Oh. Oh....

---

AHHHHHHH!!! 

---

## NARRATOR:
Sam was scared of EVERYTHING. 

---

-AAAAGH! 

---

[bark]
EEEK! 

---

[sizzles]
AACK! 

---

[rings]
WAHH! 

---

[whoosh]
OOOO! 

---

NUHHH...! 

---

-Trick or Treat!
-Huh? AAAAAGH!

---

## NARRATOR:
-Sam was scared of ANYTHING and EVERYTHING. 

---

-AAAAAAUUUGHHHHH! 

---

[screaming continues]

-Perfect! 

---

[kids shouting happily]

---

[creak, ominous riff]

---

-ohhhh...
[quirky music]

---

I am going to scare the tuna salad out of him! 

---

[wind blows]

-AHHHH! 

---

-Booga Booga Booga! Where did he go? Awww, nuts! 

---

[Plop! Leo groans]

---

I... am going to scare... the tuna salad out of him!! 
[slam]

---

[school bell rings]

[Sam groans]

---

[muffled] Hey! Booga Booga Booga! Let me out of here! 

---

I am going to scare the- 

---

[thud]

AAAUUGHH! 

---

-Huh? 

---

[yawns, lightswitch clicks] 

---

-For real this time. I’m gonna scare the tuna salad out of him.

---

I mean, monster under the bed? This is classic! Ha ha ha!

---

## NARRATOR: 
So, Leonardo snuck up on the poor, unsuspecting boy... and the monster gave it all he had! 

[spooky music crescendoes]

---

-GrrrrrRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAWWWWWWWWWW. RAWR! RAWR! RAWR RAWR RAWR RAWR RAWR! 

---

BLAGGLE BLAGGLE... RAWR! RAWR! RAWR RAWR RAWRRRR...! 

---

[panting] 

---

[sad music, Sam cries]

---

I....DID IT! I did it! I finally scared the tuna salad out of somebody! High-five me, somebody high-five me! I did it! 

---

-No, you didn’t!

---

-I didn’t? Then why are you crying? 

---

-I’m crying because....I’m crying because... 

---

[frantic off-key strumming]

Briveldy Friveldy BROTHER Wackada Rackada FIXIT
Prinkeldy Trinkeldy TOE Weebly Sneebly FRIENDS 

---

Rumbledy Bumbledy TUMMY 
Grackledy Spackledy Garbledoo Farbeldoo COCKATOO! 

---

-Uh. What did you say? 

---

[sad guitar strums]

-[singing] Why... I... am crying! 

---

My mean big brother stole my action figure... 

---

And then he broke it... He broke it on purpose... 

---

And it was my favorite toy and I tried to fix it... 
But I couldn’t... 

---

and I got so mad! And I got so mad!

---

I kicked the table and I stubbed my toe... 

---

On the same foot that I hurt when I accidentally slipped in the bathtub... 

---

After I got soap in my eyes 
Trying to wash out the bird poop 

---

That my brother’s cockatoo 
Pooped on my head... 

---

And I have no friends... 

---

And my tummy hurts...! 
And my tummy hurts...! 

---

[speaking] That’s why.... 

[silence]

---

-Oh... 

---

[menacing music and laughter]

---

-Wow, Leonardo. You couldn’t even scare The Most Scaredy-Cat Kid in the Whole World? 

---

-We knew you were a terrible monster, but we didn’t know you were *that* terrible, Leonardo! 

---

-[unintelligible] 

---

-That’s right, Fletcher! We’re going to tell everyone about this. 

---

-Haha, I’m gonna tell my sister, and the mailman, and my mom’s friend Jodie...! 

[mean laughter]

---

[melancholy music]

---

## NARRATOR: 
That’s when Leonardo made a very big decision.

---

-Uh... Rough day? 

-Yeah. 

---

-There, there. 

-What are you doing?

---

-I’m comforting you. 

-Yeah, but... But... aren’t you a monster?

---

-Yeah, well. I’m a pretty terrible monster...

---

-You’re not TERRIBLE terrible, but... actually, yeah, you are pretty terrible at being a monster.

---

-Yeah, and if I can’t be a terrible MONSTER... 

---

then maybe I can be... a... wonderful friend? 

---

-A wonderful friend? 

---

-A wonderful friend?? 

-A wonderful friend??? 

---

-[unintelligible]?!?!

-Yeah! Maybe I could be. 

---

[lo-fi upbeat music]

---

Leonardo! A Wonderful Show about a Wonderful Friend 

---

Teethy... Tall... Frightening... and Famous... 
My masterful monsterly dreams always seem on... hiatus

---

Thoughtful... Warm.... Tender... Supporting...
[roars]

---

Being a good friend, it might be much more on brand for me 

---

[music continues]

---

I don’t have to be flashy and creepy and weird
Or a horror visionary that’s feared 

---

Maybe I could be friendly and noble and nice 
Maybe being a wonderful friend will suffice 

---

I get to decide...
To be a terrible monster or a wonderful friend 

---

You could be a terrible monster 
but why not be a wonderful friend? 

---

[high-five]

---

## NARRATOR:
But that didn’t mean that Leonardo wouldn’t try to scare his friend every now and then... 

---

-Booga Booga Booga Booga! 

-Huh?

---

-Oogly boogly boogly! Ha ha!

-Hahaha. 

---

-1, 2, 3... Booga Booga Booga Booga! 

[record scratch]

---

-Please scream.

---

Aha! I did it! I scared the audience! Somebody high-five me! Someone high-five me! 

---

[gasps] Somebody high-fived me! 

---

-Hey, Leo!

-Yeah? 

---

-Let’s play! 

---

[menacing music and laughter]

-Well well well, look who’s got a new wonderful friend! 

---

-Looks like the start of a beautiful new relationship to me!! 

---

-[unintelligible]

---

-Yeah, good one, Fletcher! 

---

-That looks kind of nice, actually. 

-Yeah, I wish I had a wonderful friend. 

---

-Aren’t... we wonderful friends? 

-[unintelligible]

---

-Fletcher’s right. Our relationship is based on a more transactional... 

---

## NARRATOR:
Hey, monsters? Sorry, but we gotta keep this moving. 

---

-Sorry, Lily. 

---

## NARRATOR: 
That’s alright. 

---

-I thought we WERE wonderful friends... 

-No, I think we’re just a bunch of mean monsters... 

---

-Oh....

---

## NARRATOR: 
Book 2.

[thunderous steps]

---

[slurp]

-Ahhh.

---

In the Scaredy-Cat Electronic Data Base, or "SCERD", Sam was the most Scaredy-Cat Kid in the Whole World. 

---

But Kerry was the SECOND most Scaredy-Cat Kid in the Whole World. On a technicality.

---

[thunder]

-Eeeek! 

---

Kerry was scared of ANYTHING and EVERYTHING.

---

Eeek

---

Ahhh! 

---

Scared! 

---

Ooooh! 

---

Uhhhh uh-uh! 

---

Uh, ohhhhh! 

---

[shudders]

---

[whirring]

Eeeeeeeek!!!

---

## NARRATOR: 
Being the second most scaredy-cat kid in the whole world was... a lot! 

---

-Ohhhh. 

---

[spooky music] 

---

-[silly voice] Boogety boogety boo!   

---

## NARRATOR: 
Frankenthaler was the second most terrible monster in the world. 

---

-Heyyy. 

[sniffling]

---

-Hey, Kerry. 

-Oh, hi, Frankenthaler. 

---

-Did I scare you this time? 

-Yes.... um, absolutely.... I was terrified. 

---

-Kerry, why are you crying? 

-I am crying because... Because my... 

---

[frantic off-key strumming]
Skrunkety Bunkety SISTER Jiggly Priggely LIZARD 
Flodey Splodey FAVORITE Shoopin Whoopin DRESS 

---

Trockeru Mockelru MEENA Bacharach Scrackenack NO SNACK Blooferink Dooferink FRIENDS 
…and my tummy hurts! 

---

-Not sure I caught all that.

---

-[singing] Why... I... am crying! 

---

My big mean sister took the last piece of my jigsaw puzzle 

---

and fed it to, fed it to her lizard. Her lizard!!

---

Then when I tried to play with my chemistry kit 

---

[boom!]

I messed it up and everything exploded all over my favorite shirt 

---

That I was going to wear for picture day 

[camera clicks]

So then my mom made me wear this stupid dress.

---

This stupid dress! 

---

And then Sherman and Meena 
Laughed at me at school 

---

So I hid in the bathroom and missed my snack time. No snacks!

---

I was hungry the rest of the day 

---

And when I got home my sister had eaten all the cookies. Every last cookie!!

---

And I have no friends!! 
And my tummy hurts!!! 

---

[music fades]

-[speaking] That’s why. 

---

-Uhhh, that sounds like a lot. 

-Yeah. 

---

-Want some ice cream? 

-Yes!

---

-Well, then, sounds like we are going to the ice cream shop! 

---

-Shop? Scary! Um. Actually...nevermind. 

---

-No take backs!!. I’m gonna get mint chocolate chip... no... cookies & cream... 

---

[melancholy music]

---

[bell rings]

Or maybe I'll get one of those fancy flavors like salted caramel rosemary lemon... or artisan rum raisin brulee...

---

I know! I want... vanilla! 

-Me too.

---

## NARRATOR: 
But then, Kerry made a particularly scary discovery! 

---

[slurping]

-Huh! 

---

[anxious music]

-Buh... guh... duh... 

---

-Don’t worry Sam. That is just Frankenthaler. She’s nice. 

---

-Don’t worry Kerry. That is just Leonardo. He’s nice. 

---

## BOTH: 
I’m not scared of that monster... I’m scared of that kid! 

---

-EEEEEK!!! 

-AAAAHH!!!! 

---

-Scared!! 

---

-So scared!!! 

---

-I’m screaming!! 

---

-I’m screaming too!!! 

---

## BOTH:
We’re both screaming!!! 

---

[screaming continues]

-Hi Frankenthaler. 

---

-Hi Leo.

-I didn’t know you were friends with a scaredy cat? 

---

-Yup. I used to be the monster in her closet but then we realized we both loved puzzles.

---

-Are you thinking what I’m thinking? 

-Probably! If only they would just..

---

-Stop screaming! 

-Exactly!

---

## NARRATOR:
Something had to be done. 

---

## BOTH:
What?!

---

## NARRATOR:
I SAID: SOMETHING HAD TO BE DONE!

---

-I DON’T KNOW WHAT THAT LADY IS TALKING ABOUT. BUT SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE!

---

[screaming continues]

-Sam! Sam Sam Sammy! Sam!

---

[screaming continues]

-Alright Kerry, like we practiced, deep breath...

---

[Kerry stops screaming momentarily, then continues screaming]

---

## NARRATOR:
So the monsters made a very big decision...
They left! 

---

[screaming stops, both panting]

---

-Leonardo?... 

---

-Frankenthaler?... 

---

-Figure it out!

-Good luck!

---

## NARRATOR:
Sam had no idea what to do. 

---

Kerry had no idea what to do. 

---

So they had that in common. 

---

That’s when Sam and Kerry made a very big decision. 

---

-Umm...What decision? 

---

[record scratch]

-Yeah, what decision? 

---

## NARRATOR:
Oh, well, you see, this is the point in the story where you two decide to become friends. 

---

-Friends? 

-Huh? 

---

## NARRATOR:
Well, think about it. You’re both scaredy-cats... and you both like ice cream, right?

---

I bet you have a lot of other things in common too. Umm. Like... like... 

---

Hey, audience! What are some things you like doing with your friends? 

---

I could really use any ideas of what these two might have in common...something you like, or something you like doing, with friends. You can shout them out.

---

[the audience gives suggestions of things they like]

---

Thanks, audience! OK, Sam and Kerry, how about [audience suggestion #1]? Do you have that in common? 

---

[Sam and Kerry discuss.] 

---

[They decide that they do have that in common.]

---

Well, what about [audience suggestion #2]? 

---

[Sam and Kerry discuss.] 

---

[They decide that they do have that in common.]

---

Great! You both have things in common!

---

-Oh, wait. I got this! Sam, do you like science experiments? 

---

-No thank you. Too many smelly things and explosions!

---

 Oh. Uh. Do you like Cat-Man? 

---

-What’s a Cat-Man? 

-Oh... 

---

## NARRATOR:
Well, that’s alright. Friends have some things in common, but not everything!

---

-Huh? 

-Wait. What??

---

[synthy mid-tempo music]

---

## NARRATOR:
[singing] Kerry and Sam. Sam and Kerry. 
It can be scary to make a friend. 

---

But if you try, you might just find 
You’re scared of similar things. 

---

[screaming]

---

And the feelings you have aren’t all so bad, 
When another kid has them too 

[screaming]

---

And you might be surprised by what you find 
Someone a little bit like you! 

---

Kerry and Sam. Sam and Kerry. 

[blech!]

---

It can get hairy when making friends. 

---

[playing daintily]

Sometimes they get you, sometimes they really don’t.

---

[loud rock chord]

But differences just make us stronger...

---

And the feelings you had aren’t all just bad 
When another kid has them too! 

---

And you might be surprised by what you find 

---

Nervous but caring 
Not bad at sharing 

---

Someone who sees you 
Knows what you’re going through 

---

-Brain Freeze!!

---

-We could get matching tattoos! 

-No!

---

## NARRATOR:
They might be 
A little bit like you. 

[mid-tempo music continues]

---

[silence]

---

[speaking] So Sam made a very big decision… and so did Kerry… 

---

-...There's just this need to overdeliver, ya know. And it’s not just coming from one monster, it’s like all of monster society... 

---

-Exactly... toxic monster culture. 

-You know what I mean? Hey- where did those kids go?  

---

-Good question!  

---

-Sam? 

-Kerry?

---

-Sam? 

-Kerry?

---

## NARRATOR:
The two scaredy-cats were gone!  

---

-Sam!!

-Kerry?  

---

[menacing music]

-Sam?

-Kerry?

---

[The monsters scream, menacing music grows louder]

---

## KIDS:
SURPRISE!!!

---

## MONSTERS:
WAAAAHHHHH!   

---

## NARRATOR:
The two scaredy cats had been replaced... by two wonderful friends! 

---

Of course, Leonardo and Frankenthaler were surprised... 

---

-I’ve never been so scared in my entire life!
-That was so scary! 

---

## NARRATOR:
...They were also DELIGHTED!  

---

-That was so cool! 

-I loved it!  

---

-Wait, wait, wait! Let’s do it again. You come scare the tuna salad out of me! 

---

[quirky upbeat music playing]

---

-Dance party! 

---

Whoah, everybody's here!

---

## NARRATOR:
[singing] Feeling scary, feeling scared 
Feelings can stack up into the air 

---

Until they’re teethy, tall, and weird 
Still they’re nothing to be feared 

---

You get to decide 
To be a terrible monster or a wonderful friend 

---

You could be a terrible monster but why not be a wonderful friend

---

Ok, let’s all sing that last part together: 
“You can be a terrible monster, 
or a wonderful friend;
You can be a terrible monster, 
why not be a wonderful friend!” 

---

## EVERYONE: 
You can be a terrible monster 
Or a wonderful friend 
You can be a terrible monster 
Why not be a wonderful friend?

---

[music fades]

One more thing! 

---

One... two... three... Booga booga booga! 

---

Still got it! Lenardo: Terrible Monster and Wonderful friend!

---

[quirky music continues]
