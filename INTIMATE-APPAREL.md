## MRS. DICKSON:
Don't be fresh, Lionel. 
---
I know your mother
since before the war.  
---
Ha, Ha, Ha,
Well, there you are.
---
Mr. Charles was admiring the bread pudding 
---
and I told him that
our Esther made it. 
---
It seems he has a sweet tooth.
---
## ESTHER:
Mr. Charles is overly generous, 
---
come, the pudding ain't
nothing special.
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
And did I mention that our own most available Mr.Charles 
---
has been promoted to head Bellman 
---
at just about the finest
hotel in New York? Yes.
---
## ESTHER:
Mmmm, but he still fetching luggage.
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
Not just any kinda luggage, 
---
high-class luggage.
---
## ESTHER:
And is high-class luggage easier to carry?
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
I reckon it is easier to haul silk than cotton, 
---
if you know what I'm saying.  
---
Yes.
---
## ESTHER:
I see that he is also wearing cashmere this evening.
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
Well now. 
---
It's easy to tell about a man by where he shops, 
---
than his practiced conversation. 
---
'Cause any man with 
enough tonic can talk smooth, 
---
but not every man has the good
sense to shop at
---
## ESTHER and MRS. DICKSON:
Saperstein's.
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
[laughs]
That's lovely.
---
## ESTHER:
It's for Corinna Mae's wedding night.
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
Don't tell me you've been in here all evening?
---
Corinna Mae is getting ready to leave with her fiancé.
---
## ESTHER:
I wish I could find my party face.
---
It really is a lovely
affair. 
---
You done a fine job.
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
Come now, it ain't over yet. 
---
Put down your sewing,
---
put it aside
---
straighten yourself up. 
---
There. 
---
You gonna have a dance before
this evening's out.
---
## ESTHER:
Please, Mrs. Dickson, 
---
I can't, really. 
---
I'll just stand there
like a wallflower.
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
Nonsense, 
Ester, 
---
you don't have to stand there like a wallflower
---
You see, I have been dancing 
---
a half a dozen times,
---
and my feet are just about worn out.
---
## ESTHER:
If I had your good looks I'd raise a bit of dust myself.
---
Ain't nobody down there interested in me.
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
Oh, you're being silly now, Ester. 
---
Now, you've been moping
around here for days. 
---
What's the matter?
---
## ESTHER:
If you must know, 
---
I turned thirty-five Thursday past.
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
Oh my Lord, I forgot, 
---
I sure did. 
---
You know with all that going on with Corinna Mae 
---
it slipped my mind. 
---
Happy birthday, my sweet Esther. 
---
## ESTHER:
It's fine. 
---
You had all this to prepare for. 
---
And I been living in this house for so long, 
---
I reckon I'm just another piece
of furniture.
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
Never. 
---
You were a godsend when you come
to me at seventeen. 
---
Yes. 
---
I remember how young and sweet you were
---
carrying a sack full of overripe fruit 
---
smelling like a Georgia orchid.
---
## ESTHER:
And now? 
---
Twenty-two girls later, 
---
if you count Lerleen.
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
Lerleen.
---
## ESTHER:
That's how many of these parties I have had to go to 
---
and play merry. 
---
And I should be happy for them, 
---
I know, but each time I think
---
why ain't it me. 
---
Silly Corinna Mae, ain't got no brain at all, 
---
and just as plain as flour.
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
Your time will come, child.
---
## ESTHER:
What if it don't? 
---
template: noise
laughter from party
---
Oh, and, listen to her laughing. 
---
God forgive me, 
---
but I hate her laughter, 
---
I hate her happiness 
---
and I feel simply awful for saying so. 
---
And I'm afraid if I go back in there, 
---
she'll see it all over my face, 
---
and it's her day.
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
There are a number of young men open to your smile. 
---
But a sour face don't bring nothing but contempt. 
---
You know our Mr. Charles has had 
---
three servings of your bread pudding.
---
## ESTHER:
And he shouldn't have had any.
---
He weighs nearly as much as your horse.
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
Nonsense, he weighs more then poor Jessup.
---
Shhh. He is a good man, 
---
and poised for success. Yes.
---
## ESTHER:
But he's been coming to these parties for near two years
---
and if he ain't met a woman, 
---
I'd bet it ain't a woman he after. 
---
I've been warned about men in refined suits. 
---
But still, Esther would be
lucky enough for his attention, 
---
that's what your thinking. 
---
Well, I ain't giving up so easy.
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
Good for you. 
---
But there are many a cautionary
tale 
---
bred of overconfidence. 
---
Yes. 
---
But you shouldn't be so particular.
---
## ESTHER:
Well, I ain't going down there 
---
to be paraded like some featherless bird. 
---
I'm sorry; 
---
would you kindly take this down to Corinna Mae?
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
I'll do no such thing. 
---
You carry it down there yourself. 
---
It's tough Esther, 
---
It's tough to be a colored woman in this city.
---
I know, you know that
---
and Corinna Mae all she got is her
honey-colored skin,
---
but you got nimble fingers
---
And your smart and good
---
and you deserve all the attention in that room, 
---
all I ask is that you
come and toast her 
---
the way I know she'd toast you. 
---
Put aside your feelings
---
and don't say nothing about Sarah's music playing, 
---
She trying.
---
For God's sake, this a party not a wake.
---
## ESTHER:
Let me fix my hair. 
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
Oh, and I thought you would be wanting this.
---
This letter come this morning, 
---
and I didn't want to forget.
---
## ESTHER:
Who'd be writing me?
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
Mr. George Armstrong.
---
## ESTHER:
He ain't somebody I know. 
---
Armstrong? 
---
There was an Armstrong that attended my church, 
---
but he dead a long time now.
---
Will you read the letter to me? 
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
I got a house full of people. 
---
You best be reminding me tomorrow. 
---
Now I'll see you downstairs, shortly. 
---
And there's plenty of fruit and punch left 
---
and it's better than New Year's, 
---
so best be coming on down.
---
I'm making sure that everybody leaves this party happy. 
---
## GEORGE:
Dear Miss Mills,
---
My name is George Armstrong. 
---
I work in Panama alongside
Carson Wynn, 
---
your deacon's son. 
---
We digging a big hole across the
land, 
---
they say one day ships will pass from one ocean to the next. 
---
It is important work, we told. 
---
If importance be measured by how
many men die, 
---
then this be real important work. 
---
One man drops for every twenty feet of canal dug, 
---
like so many flies. 
---
Carson say if we eat a can of sardines, 
---
they'll protect us against the mosquitoes and fever. 
---
I say, not as long as we be digging. 
---
Lord knows our minds deserve a bit of shade. 
---
But ain't such a thing to be had, not here at least. 
---
Don't think me too forward, 
---
but I thought it would be nice to
have someone to think about, 
---
someone not covered from head to
toe in mud, 
---
someone to ward off this awful boredom. 
---
Carson speaks so highly of his church 
---
that I find comfort in his recollections. 
---
I ask if I may write you? 
---
And if you so please, 
---
I'd welcome your words.
---
Sincerely,
George Armstrong

## MRS. VAN BUREN:
I feel exposed. 
---
I think the straps need to be
tightened, Esther.
---
## ESTHER:
No ma'am, 
---
that's the way it's meant to be, 
---
but I'll add a little more fabric to the
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
No, no, 
---
if this is what you made for that
singer, 
---
it is what I want. 
---
All right. 
---
I'm coming out. 
---
---
Oh God, I look ridiculous, 
---
and I'm behaving absolutely
foolishly, 
---
but I'm not sure what else to do. 
---
Look at me. 
---
I've spent a fortune on feathers 
---
and every manner of accouterment. 
---
They've written positively splendid
things 
---
about me in the columns this season.
---
## ESTHER:
I'm sure they did.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
But does it matter? 
---
Has he spent an evening at home? 
---
Or even noticed 
---
that I've painted the damn boudoir
vermilion red?
---
## ESTHER:
You look lovely, Mrs. Van Buren.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
Ha! I feel like a tart 
---
from the Tenderloin.
---
Granted I've never been, 
---
but I'm told. 
---
Are you sure 
---
this is what you made for that singer?
---
## ESTHER:
It is identical to the stitching. 
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
And you say the French women are wearing these?
---
## ESTHER:
So I'm told.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
I don't believe it. 
---
It hardly seems decent. 
---
But I suppose the French aren't known for their modesty. 
---
## ESTHER:
Well, it the rage. 
---
Some ladies ain't even wearing corsets in private.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
Is that true?
---
## ESTHER:
Most gals don't like 'em, 
---
even fine ladies like yourself.
---
Truth is I ain't known a man to 
---
court pain for a woman's glance.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
You're not one of those 
---
suffragettes, are you?
---
## ESTHER:
Oh God no, Mrs. Van Buren.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
Indeed. 
---
I'd just as soon not tamper 
---
in men's business. 
---
## ESTHER:
Talk and a nickel 
---
will buy you five cents worth of trouble.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
It's come to this. 
---
If Mother dear could see 
---
what has become of her peach in the big city. 
---
Do we really need all of these 
---
dangling things?
---
## ESTHER:
Oh, I hope you ain't mind, 
---
I added a touch of beading
---
along the trim.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
It is different.
---
## ESTHER:
Do you like it?
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
I confess, I almost do. 
---
It's a bit naughty.
---
[Giggles.]
---
Yes , I might even wear it beneath my gown tonight. 
---
Do you think anyone will notice? 
---
It is the annual Gardenia Ball, 
---
quite the event of the season.
---
## ESTHER:
So I hear.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
And do you know what that means? 
---
They'll all be there, 
---
parading their good fortune. 
---
and I'll have to smile, be polite, 
---
because I'm known for that, 
---
but I will dread every last minute, 
---
every bit of forced conversation 
---
with the Livingstons and the Babcocks. 
---
They want to know. 
---
All of them do.
---
"When are you going to have a child, Evangeline?" 
---
And my answer is always the same, 
---
"Why we're working on it, dear, speak to Harold."
---
And dear Harry will be in a sour mood for a week. 
---
You probably don't even know what I'm talking about. 
---
Have you children?
---
## ESTHER:
No, Mrs. Van Buren. 
---
I ain't been married.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
Really? 
---
May I tell you something?
---
## ESTHER:
Yes. If you like.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
I've given him no children.  
---
I'm afraid I can't. 
---
It's not for the lack of trying. 
---
One takes these things for granted, 
---
you assume when it comes time that it will happen,
---
and when it doesn't who is to blame? 
---
They think it's vanity that's
kept me childless, 
---
I've heard the women whispering. 
---
If only I were that vain. 
---
But it's like he's given up.
---
## ESTHER:
But, you're so beautiful.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
You think so?
---
## ESTHER:
Yes. 
---
I can't imagine he'd ever lose interest.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
But he has found other interests. 
---
Trust me. 
---
You will keep this between us? 
---
I'm told you're discreet.
---
## ESTHER:
I just sew, missus. 
---
I don't hear anything 
---
that I ain't supposed to.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
I'd rather not be divorced, 
---
at my age it would prove disastrous.
---
## ESTHER:
Do you think there's something 
---
wrong with a woman alone?
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
What I think is of little consequence. 
---
If I were brave 
---
I would collect my things right now 
---
and I would find a small clean room someplace 
---
on the other side of the park. 
---
No, further even. 
---
And I'd 
---
But it isn't a possibility, is it? 
---
## ESTHER:
I don't know that I'll marry.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
Oh, of course you will, 
---
it's all about finding
the right gentleman.
---
## ESTHER:
Well ma'am, I don't mean to speak out of turn. 
---
But, I been working since I was nine years old with barely 
---
a day's rest. 
---
In fact, the other evening 
---
I was at my sewing machine 
---
and I stopped working 
---
and all this time had passed, 
---
gone. 
---
Years really. 
---
And I known right there 
---
that some things ain't meant to be. 
---
And that's all right, ain't it? 
---
And I wouldn't have thought no more about it, 
---
but then I got this 
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
Yes?
---
## ESTHER:
I'm ashamed to say. 
---
At my age it foolish, I know.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
What is it?
---
## ESTHER:
A gentleman.
---
A gentleman has taken interest in me.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
A gentleman. Really? 
---
How wonderful! 
---
Is he respectable?
---
## ESTHER:
I don't know, 
---
I mean, I don't know him actually. 
---
I got me this letter from Panama. 
---
A man in Panama. 
---
He wrote about two weeks back. 
---
I been carrying it around since. 
---
But, I ain't so sure should answer.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
And why not?
---
## ESTHER:
I ain't much of a writer.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
Oh 
---
## ESTHER:
No, I ain't a writer at all. 
---
The fact is 
---
I...I can't read.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
Do you have the letter? 
---
May I see it? 
---
---
Panama. 
---
He has lovely penmanship, 
---
that's important. 
---
He isn't careless with his stroke,
---
now that's the mark of a thoughtful man. 
---
It's a good thing, I believe.
---
## ESTHER:
I won't respond, of course, 
---
if it ain't appropriate.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
Nonsense. 
---
He's halfway across the world.
---
I'm sure he's perfectly harmless. 
---
He's just a bit lonesome is all.
---
## ESTHER:
But, if I have Mrs. Dickson 
---
over at the rooming house
help me, 
---
she'll get all up in my business. 
---
And she's got an opinion
about everything 
---
and I'd rather not be questioned or lectured
---
or bothered. 
---
She's just about the busiest person that
---
in any event,
---
she said to rip it up promptly, 
---
a decent woman wouldn't resort to such a dalliance.
---
But as you can see he has taken interest in me.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
Would you like me to help you write to him, Esther?
---
## ESTHER:
I couldn't ask.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
You needn't, I insist.
---
## ESTHER:
I never done this before.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
Nor have I.
---
## ESTHER:
Maybe it ain't such a good idea, 
---
Mrs. Van Buren. 
---
I ain't really got much to say.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
Of course you do 
---
## ESTHER: 
No, I don't! 
---
I live in a rooming house
---
with seven unattached women 
---
and sew intimate apparel for ladies,
---
but that ain't for a gentleman's eyes. 
---
Sure I can tell him everything there
is to know about fabric, 
---
but that hardly seems a life worthy of words.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
It is a beginning. 
---
Come on Esther, don't be shy.  
---
Now, how shall we start?
---
## ESTHER:
I don't know.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
What sort of things do you like to do?
---
## ESTHER:
I...I go to church every Sunday, 
---
well practically, 
---
I don't really listen to the sermons, 
---
I just like the company 
---
and the singing of course 
---
And on Tuesdays 
---
I take the trolley down-town to Orchard Street, 
---
and I climb five flights, 
---
in darkness, 
---
to this tiny apartment. 
---
And, when I open the door my eyes are met. 
---
He keeps a wealth of fabric in
that apartment. 
---
He got everything you need, 
---
even things you don't know you need 
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
Esther, you're jumping a bit ahead of your-self.  
---
Shall we begin 
---
with "Dear Mr.Armstrong —"
---
## ESTHER:
Yes. 
---
That's good. 
---
"Dear Mr. Armstrong —"
---
## GEORGE:
Dear Miss Mills,
---
template: overlap
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
"I received your letter " 

## GEORGE:
I received your letter. 
---
[background forest sounds]

It two months in the coming, so please forgive me, 
---
I've already written you twice since. 
---
I am most happy to make your acquaintance, 
---
and I'm anxious to hear all about you.
---
As for me, I'd like to report on our good progress, 
---
but it isn't the case. 
---
This canal seem a near-impossible mission, 
---
but here we be, digging until day-end 
---
bathed in mud up to our necks. 
---
They say 
---
a mad Frenchman dreamed up this Panama project, 
---
and convinced the devil to give him an army of workers. 
---
The price, 
---
this great fissure across the land 
---
that reach right into the earth's belly. 
---
Indeed, 
---
chaos is a jackhammer away, 
---
that's what be said here anyway. 
---
But when the great oceans meet 
---
and the gentlemen celebrate, 
---
will we colored men 
---
be given glasses to raise? 
---
Today we severed the roots 
---
of a giant Flamboyant, 
---
and watched it tumble to the ground. 
---
I stood thigh-deep 
---
in crimson blossoms, 
---
swathed in the sweet aroma of death
---
and wondered how a place so beautiful 
---
could become a morgue.
---
But the days aren't all bad. 
---
If you take a moment 
---
to listen to the forest around us 
---
there is so much life 
---
just out of sight. 
---
And there be men from every corner of the Caribbean, 
---
sharing tales around fires,
---
heads light on rum and laughter.
[laughs] 
---
But now, I read your letter. 
---
I see you sitting at your sewing machine. 
---
I hear the sound of the wheel
turning, 
---
the tiny stitches drawing together the pieces of satin. 
---
They got machines here 
---
that take six men to operate, 
---
and slice through stone like butter. 
---
All this wonder and waste, 
---
but your letter be the most splendid thing 
---
and shall ride in me pocket, 
---
until the next.
---
Yours Considerately,
---
George Armstrong

Hi, Mr. Marks? 
---
Am I too early?
---
## MARKS:
No, not at all. 
---
Come in. Come in. 
---
I've a number of new things to show you.

Ah.

Let me get.

Feel this one.

Japanese silk,

your special order for the lady on
Fifth Avenue. 
---
It took me nearly one month to find this very piece.

I had to go everywhere.

Lovely. Yes?

Lovely. 
---
Look at how finely embroidered.

Beautiful.

I have two extra yards left,

I give to you for next to nothing.

If you'd like.

Next to nothing is too much for me.

You know my answer. 
---
What will I do with it?
---
## MARKS:
Make something lovely for yourself.
---
## ESTHER:
It will be wasted on me.
---
## MARKS:
You'll never see this again. 
---
I guarantee. 
---
I'll let our Fifth
Avenue lady cover the difference. 
---
How about that? 
---
I see how much you like. 
---
I promise it is the very best quality.

She don't know what she has, 
---
she don't come down here to feel the fabric herself, 
---
to feel the difference, 
---
the texture, 
---
she don't know how remarkable a weave.
---
## ESTHER:
I could make a shawl.
---
## MARKS:
Or a smoking jacket 
---
for your gentleman, perhaps.
---
## ESTHER:
My gentleman? 
---
Oh no.  
---
You've distracted me, Mr. Marks. 
---
You always get me to buy something 
---
I don't need.
---
## MARKS:
When I see something of quality, 
---
I like to share with my favorite customers. 
---
Everybody want the same thing. 
---
But you want different. 
---
I like that.
---
## ESTHER:
Thank you. 
---
## MARKS:
Ah, look at that. 
---
I have lost a button. 
---
I buy at the docks yesterday morning, 
---
it come right offa ship from the Orient, 
---
I see it and think Esther Mills will like.
---
Everybody else gabardine, wool, nainsook. 
---
But it isn't often that something 
---
so fine and delicate enters the
store. 
---
Look at the way the gold thread is interwoven; 
---
a hand took the time to gently wind it 
---
through each and every stitch 
---
like a magician. 
---
It is magnificent, yes. 
---
I can see from your hands 
---
that you are blessed with the needle and the thread, 
---
which means you'll never be without warmth.
---
## ESTHER:
I'm afraid it was either learn to sew 
---
or turn back sheets for fifty cents a day.
---
## MARKS:
You make it sound too simple. 
---
My father sew, 
---
my brother sew, yes, 
---
for the finest families. 
---
But I don't have the discipline, 
---
the fingers. 
---
Look at the size of these hands. 
---
Like carnati, 
---
Romanian sausage.
---
## ESTHER:
[laughs]
---
I wish for your hands. 
---
## ESTHER:
It's fruit dye. 
---
Am I right? 
---
It smells like
---
## MARKS:
an imperial palace, 
---
it is signed by the artist 
---
Oh, right there. 
---
I wouldn't be surprised 
---
if it was created for an empress.
---
## ESTHER:
Huh. 
---
You really want me to buy this, don't you? 
---
All right, 
---
it means I'll go without sugar for a week, 
---
will that make you happy?
---
## MARKS:
It makes you happy, 
---
it makes me happy.
---
## ESTHER:
I do want it.
---
The color won't rub off on you.
---
## MARKS:
No, no. 
---
I'm sorry. 
---
No, it's not that. 
---
Please. 
---
My religious belief 
---
doesn't permit me to touch a woman 
---
who isn't my wife or my relative.
---
## ESTHER:
Oh, I see.
---
## MARKS:
It is the rabbinical law, 
---
not mine.
---
## ESTHER:
Your wife must be a happy woman.
---
## MARKS:
I am not married. 
---
Not yet. 
---
My fiancée is in Romania.
---
Um, my family made the arrangement years ago.
---
## ESTHER:
Oh? 
---
I bet you miss her something awful. 
---
## MARKS:
I haven't ever met her, actually.

Yeah

My daddy gave me twelve
lashes

with a switch

for playing this piece in our parlor.

One for each year I studied the piano.

He was too proper to like anything
colored,

was about the worst crime

You must have gotten a lot of licks in your time.

Yeah, baby,

I wasn't born this black and blue.

Anything else, Mistress?

## MAYME:
Hush your mouth,

you're far too sweet for sarcasm. 
---
---
## MAYME:
That's for me?
---
## ESTHER:
I made one just like it 
---
for a lady on Fifth Avenue.
---
## MAYME:
It's so pretty. 
---
That's for me? 
---
No kidding? 
---
Can I try it on?
---
## ESTHER:
Of course you can.
---
## MAYME:
Feel it. 
---
Oooo. It feels like Fifth Avenue does. 
---
You outdone yourself this time, honey.
---
## ESTHER:
Stop talking and put it on.  
---
And look at the flowers, ain't they sweet? 
---
It took me a whole day just to sew them on. 
---
## MAYME:
For shame. 
---
This the prettiest thing

anybody ever made for me. 
---
Truly.
---
## ESTHER:
You know that white lady I talk about sometime, 
---
Oh hold on 
---
She keep asking me 
---
what they be wearing up in the Tenderloin. 
---
All that high breeding 
---
and she want what you wearing.
---
## MAYME:
No kidding?
---
## ESTHER:
What she got, you want, 
---
what you got, she want.
---
## MAYME:
Onliest, I ain't got the money to pay for it.  
---
Whatcha think? 
---
Do I look like a Fifth Avenue bird?
---
## ESTHER:
Grand. 
---
You look grand. 
---
Mr. Marks say, 
---
that satin foulard was made for the 
---
finest ladies in Paris.
---
## MAYME:
No kidding.
---
## ESTHER:
I wasn't going to buy it. 
---
But, oh God, 
---
if he didn't talk me into it.
---
## MAYME:
Mr. Marks?
---
Who is this Mr. Marks?
---
## ESTHER:
He just a salesman. That's all.
---
## MAYME:
Mmm, It sound to me like you bit sweet on him.

## ESTHER:
Me?

Oh no, he a Jew. 
---
## MAYME:
And?

I been with a Jew,

with a Turk even.

And let me tell ya,

a gentle touch is gold in any country.

## ESTHER:
I see the bodice is bit snug
---

Is he handsome?

## ESTHER:
I ain't noticed.

Good patient, Esther.

Come, he wouldn't be your first,

would he?

I ain't listenin'.

You dear thing. 
[Laughing]
---
No kidding.

I can't even remember what it was like. 
---
Ain't that something.
---
## ESTHER:
Let's not talk about this.
---
## MAYME:
Mercy, what you must think of me. 
---
## ESTHER:
And if you must know, 
---
I'm being courted by a gentleman.
---
## MAYME:
Courted by a gentleman. 
---
Beg my pardon. 
---
Not that Panama
man? 
---
Oh come on, 
---
don't tell me you still writing him.
---
## ESTHER:
He writing me.

## MAYME:
You'd rather a man

then down Broadway.

What you expecting him to arrive in the mail

## ESTHER:
Please don't make sport, Mayme.

## MAYME:
I'm just playing with you.

## ESTHER:
I ain't expectin' nothing.

## MAYME:
Sure you are. 
---
Sure you are, honey. 
---
Who ain't?

I am a concert pianist

And Madame always takes tea

twice a week with her dear friend

Miss Esther Mills,

who's known in circles for

for um...
---
For what? 
---
I forget.  
---
Come on, Miss Esther, 
---
don't be proud.
---
## ESTHER:
I own a quaint beauty parlor for colored ladies.
---
## MAYME:
Of course.
---
## ESTHER:
The smart set. 
---
Someplace east of Amsterdam, 
---
fancy,
---
where you get pampered and treated real nice. 
---
'Cause no one does
it for us. 
---
We just as soon wash our heads in a bucket 
---
and be treated like mules. 
---
But what I'm talking about is someplace elegant.
---
## MAYME:
Oooo, missie, you too fancy for me.
---
## ESTHER:
And when you come in Miss Mayme, 
---
I'll take your coat and
ask, 
---
"Would you like a cup of tea?"
---
## MAYME:
Why, thank you.
---
## ESTHER:
And I'll open a book of illustrations, 
---
and show you the latest styles.
---
## MAYME:
Ooo, I can pick anything in the book?
---
## ESTHER:
Yes.
---
## MAYME:
How about if I let you choose?
---
## ESTHER:
Very well. 
---
Make yourself comfortable, 
---
put your feet up,
---
I know they tired.
---
## MAYME:
Shucks honey, 
---
you don't know the half.
---
## ESTHER:
And in no time flat 
---
for the cost a ride uptown and back,
---
you got a whole new look.
---
## MAYME:
Just like that? 
---
I reckon I'd pay someone good money 
---
to be treated like a lady. 
---
It would be worth two, 
---
three days on my back. 
---
Yes, it would.
---
## ESTHER:
You think so?
---
## MAYME:
I know so.
---
## ESTHER:
And if I told you 
---
I got a little, something saved? 
---
I keep it sewed up in the lining of a crazy quilt.
---
## MAYME:
On a cold lonely night
---
wouldn't that quilt be a poor
woman's dream.
---
## ESTHER:
I been saving it slowly 
---
since I come North. 
---
It for that beauty parlor. 
---
I ain't told nobody that. 
---
Honest, for true.
---
## MAYME:
Where'd you get such a damn serious face?
---
## ESTHER:
Why not?
---
## MAYME:
Because, we just fooling that's all. 
---
I ain't been to Prague, 
---
ain't never going to Prague.
---
## ESTHER:
But come, 
---
is this what you want to be doing 
---
ten years from now, twenty?
---
## MAYME:
You think I ain't tried to make a go of it. 
---
You think I just
laid down 
---
and opened my legs 
---
'cause it was easy. 
---
This place may not look like nothing, 
---
but this saloon is better 
---
then a lot of them places, 
---
ask anybody. 
---
Oh, just last night one of Bert Williams' musicians 
---
sat up front, 
---
and he stayed through the entire show. 
---
You think some of
those gals in the big revues 
---
didn't start right where I am.
---
## ESTHER:
You got this beautiful piano 
---
that you play better than
anyone I know. 
---
There are a dozen church choirs that you could play
---
## MAYME:
Let me tell you, 
---
so many wonderful ideas been conjured in this room. 
---
And they get left in that bed, 
---
or on this piano bench. 
---
They are scattered all over this room. 
---
Esther. 
---
I ain't waiting on anybody to rescue me. 
---
My Panama man done come and gone
long time now. 
---
It sweet that he write you but,
---
my dear, it ain't real.
---
## ESTHER:
Yes, 
---
he here in my pocket in a cambric walking suit, 
---
and he has a heliotrope handkerchief 
---
stuffed in his pocket 
---
and a sweet way about him. 
---
He so far away, 
---
I can carry him in my pocket like a
feather. 
---
## MAYME:
You funny. 
---
You and your silly letter.
---
## ESTHER:
Ain't a week go by without one. 
---
It got so I know the postman by name. 
---
## MAYME:
Well, I ain't interested. 
---
So put it away.
---
## ESTHER:
Cmon Miss Mayme don't be proud, 
---
you know you want to read it. 
---
---
## MAYME:
Oh Hell, give it here. 
---
Ooo.
---
## ESTHER:
What it say?
---
## MAYME:
Look like your man got himself a new pair of socks. 
---
Wait a minute, he askin' what you look like. 
---
Ain't you told him?
---
## ESTHER:
No, I was afraid, 
---
I ain't known what to say.
---
## MAYME:
You tell him the truth.
---
## ESTHER:
That I don't look like much.
---
## MAYME:
You tell him that you're about as lovely a person as there is.
---
## ESTHER:
That ain't so.
---
## MAYME:
Of course, it is. 
---
And you think half the men that come in here 
---
bother looking at my face. 
---
He don't care about this.
---
He interested in this. 
---
This is what he's asking about. [laughs]
---
## ESTHER:
I wouldn't dare write about something like that. 
---
He Christian!
---
## MAYME:
And it's in his weakness 
---
that he'll find his strength.
---
Hallelujah! 
---
## MAYME:

## ESTHER:
I'm being serious and you got your mind in the gutter.
---
## MAYME:
Oh come on Esther, 
---
the man just asking what you look
like 
---
'cause he want something pretty 
---
to think about come sundown.
---
## ESTHER:
You reckon? 
---
Will you help me write something?
---
## MAYME:
No, what about your white lady? 
---
Why not have her do it? 
---
## ESTHER:
'Cause I'm asking you, my friend.
---
## MAYME:
No, my writing ain't perfect.
---
## ESTHER:
Don't bother about the handwriting,
---
we'll tell him I pricked my finger while sewing. 
---
He'll understand. 
---
Please.
---
## MAYME:
Oh.  
---
I ain't romantic, 
---
I find this silly, really I do. 
---
But only 'cause it's you. 
---
So, where should we begin?
---
## ESTHER:
"Dear George." 
---
## MAYME: 
A love letter to a gentleman. 
---
Oooo, I know.

"Dear George, I write you wearing a lavender silk robe with — "

---
## GEORGE:
Dear Esther,
---
Thank you for your sweet words. 
---
Your pricked finger 
---
delivered the most unexpected lift. 
---
It quiet now. 
---
The only motion is the rain.
---
The only sound is the rain. 
---
It is the white season, 
---
and the work all but stop. 
---
The rum shop be the onliest business that do prosper. 
---
I seen months of hard work lost in an evening 
---
and good men befriend the devil overnight. 
---
And if I told you it's been months 
---
since I've seen a decent a woman 
---
it wouldn't be a lie. 
---
There are caravans of sweet-faced Indian girls 
---
offering up their childhood 
---
for a half-day's wage. 
---
Yes, many men leave here with less than they come. 
---
I shan't be one. 
---
It isn't appropriate, 
---
but I will say it. 
---
I crave a gentlewoman's touch, 
---
even if only be to turn down my collar 
---
or brush away the dirt in the evenings. 
---
I'd like to meet you as a gentleman. 
---
I think much about the suit I will wear, 
---
and the colors that your eyes
find pleasing. 
---
I imagine your cobblestone roads 
---
and the splendid carriages 
---
on the avenues, 
---
and a dry place to sit. 
---
I think of you 
---
running silk thread between your fingers 
---
and find a bit of holy relief, 
---
for your letters arrive just in time 
---
to ward off temptation.
---
Yours Affectionately,
---
George

I'm sorry,

That's all.

I know these kind of men.

Sugared words, 
---
but let them stick to the page 
---
and go no further. 
---
He'll steal your common sense, 
---
he will 
---
and walk away. 
---
It just don't seem like you, Esther, 
---
you're too practical a girl for this.
---
## ESTHER:
Don't set your clock by my habits.
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
His tone is very familiar. 
---
And I don't approve.
---
## ESTHER:
I'm sorry, 
---
I needn't your approval.
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
My goodness. 
---
I hope you don't expect
---
nothing to come of this. 
---
## ESTHER:
And if I do?
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
Mr. Charles 
---
Mr. Charles has asked me twice about you this week. 
---
I told him he was most welcome to call.
---
## ESTHER:
Mr. Charles is a fool 
---
and a glutton. 
---
And I'm sure he don't 
even know who I am.
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
You a stubborn young country girl. 
---
And very particular. 
---
And it wouldn't hurt you to be more receptive.
---
## ESTHER:
To who? 
---
Mr. Charles? 
---
Remember it's me you're talking
to, 
---
not Doreen or Erma, 
---
or one of those other silly 
---
open-hearted little gals. 
---
And yes, 
---
I'm writing letters to a man. 
---
And it may come to nothing. 
---
But I am his sweetheart twice a month, 
---
and I can fill that envelope 
---
with anything that I want.
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
It's an innocent enough flirtation, 
---
and I had my share in my youth. 
---
And believe me when I say 
---
that I was romanced 
---
by many bright and willing young man. 
---
It's potent, I know, 
---
but I ain't ashamed to say
---
and I ain't afraid to say 
---
that it ultimately led 
---
to compromise. 
---
And if you're not careful, then Esther 
---
## ESTHER:
DON'T! 
---
This quilt is filled with my hard work, 
---
one hundred dollars for every year 
---
I been seated at that sewing machine.
---
It's my beauty parlor. 
---
So you see I don't need Mr. Charles 
---
for his good job and position. 
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
You think this is enough? 
---
Do you? 
---
You think you're gonna be happy 
---
when another half dozen girls 
---
waltz away in camisoles of your making. 
---
When the Bellman's Ball 
---
comes around another year 
---
and you here fluffing ruffles 
---
for some girl from Kentucky, 
---
who just happy to be wearing shoes.
---
## ESTHER:
No, I don't think that. 
---
And would give this quilt 
---
and every-thing in it 
---
to be with someone I care for, 
---
I would.
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
This man in Panama,

Dear Esther,

I opened the letter

tumbled out onto the ground.

Imagine my surprise,

gray wool, pink silk and the blue flannel, 
---
I tucked in the back of my shirt this morning.

It is hand-dyed silk, I washed it yesterday and look.

Beautiful.

Have you ever seen anything like that?

Never.

It will feel even better against your back.

Don't worry.

It is fine.

It'll take me no time.

Thank you.

Truly.

It is fine.

Why do you always wear black? 
---
You sell these magnificent colors, 
---
and yet every time I see you, 
---
you're wearing black.
---
## MARKS:
You ask a very complicated question. 
---
Its an act of faith,
---
that is the simplest way I know how to explain. 
---
It is one of the many ways 
---
I show my devotion to God. 
---
## ESTHER:
Is marrying someone you don't know another?
---
## MARKS:
It is a thousand years of history 
and struggle 
---
behind the answer to that question.
---
## ESTHER:
And yet it seems as simple as 
---
taking off a jacket. 
---
I'm sorry, 
---
I didn't mean to upset you.
---
## MARKS:
You haven't upset me.
---
## ESTHER:
If you wrap the magenta, 
---
I'll pay you next week.
---
## MARKS:
To answer your question, 
---
it has always been that way 
---
in my family.
---
## ESTHER:
But this a new country.
---
## MARKS:
But we come with our pockets stuffed, yes. 
---
We don't throw away nothing 
---
for fear we might need it later 
---
I wear my father's suit. 
---
It is old, I know, 
---
but this simple black fabric is my
most favorite. 
---
Why? 
---

## MRS. VAN BUREN:
Hand-dyed silk? 
---
Is it popular?
---
## ESTHER:
It will be by fall.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
Really? 
---
I have to weave that tidbit 
---
into conversation this evening.
---
My in-laws are coming. 
---
The frog and the wart. 
---
Oh, and did I tell you? 
---
I got to see Mr. Max Fiedler of Germany
---
conduct selections from Don Juan. 
---
I had to 'endure an encore from
the soprano, 
---
what was her name? 
---
Something Russian, no doubt. 
---
I'd rather have gone to the electric show 
---
at Madison Square Garden,
---
but you see Harry isn't impressed with electricity 
---
"Miracle upon miracle, 
---
but there remain things science 
---
will never be able to give
us," he says, 
---
so he refrains from enthusiasm. 
---
By the way, 
---
I bled this morning, 
---
and when I delivered the news to Harry 
---
he spat at me. 
---
This civilized creature of society. 
---
We all bleed, Esther. 
---
And yet I felt
---
as though I was a young girl again 
---
apologizing for becoming a woman.  
---
Maybe I'll be a bohemian,
---
a bohemian needn't a husband, 
---
she's not bound by convention.'
---
## ESTHER:
I don't see why 
---
you let him do you this way, missus. 
---
If you don't mind me saying. 
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
Have you been to the opera? 
---
## ESTHER:
Never.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
Oh God, you're lucky. 
---
It's one of those things that's required of me. 
---
I'm sure you've found a more 
---
engaging means of entertainment.
---
## ESTHER:
I actually only been to the theatre once.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
Really? 
---
What did you see?
---
## ESTHER:
Nothing special. 
---
A blind gal from Alabama sang spirituals.
---
I need you to lift your arms.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
Like this? 
---
It's pinching me right here. 
---
---
I've never been to a colored show before, 
---
I'm told they're quite good.
---
## ESTHER:
I suppose.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
I should like to see one for myself. 
---
You must take me to one of your shows.
---
## ESTHER:
And will you take me to the opera 
---
next time you go?
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
I would, if I could. 
---
It would be marvelously
scandalous, 
---
just the sort of thing to perk up this humdrum season: 
---
It is so easy to be with you.
---
Your visits are just about the only 
---
thing I look forward to these days. 
---
You, and our letters to George, 
---
of course. 
---
Shall we write something dazzling to him this time? 
---
Something delicious. 
---
## ESTHER:
But, if we
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
What? 
---
Why not?
---
## ESTHER:
Perhaps something simple this time, 
---
I believe there real affection growing.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
Yes, one would hope. 
---
He seems quite taken.
---
## ESTHER:
I don't want him to be disappointed.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
And he needn't be. 
---
We will send him your warmth 
---
and he will find you irresistible.
---
## ESTHER:
Do you think we could describe this silk?
---
Will you tell him what it feel like against your skin? 
---
How it soft and supple to the touch. 
---
I ain't got the words, 
---
but I want him to know this color,
---
magenta red. 
---
What it make you feel right now. 
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
The silk? 
---
Are you sure?
---
## ESTHER:
Yes.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
Mercy, 
---
if my friends knew 
---
that I spend my afternoons writing love letters 
---
to a colored laborer, 
---
they'd laugh me out of
Manhattan.
---
## ESTHER:
People do a lot of things 
---
that they don't ever speak of.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
I smoked opium once, 
---
with the most proper of women. 
---
She dared me and I did it. 
---
And you? 
---
What have you done? 
---
## ESTHER:
I touched someone 
---
who I knew I wasn't supposed to touch. 
---
I touched them because I wanted to, 
---
it was wrong, 
---
but I couldn't help myself.

## GEORGE:
Dearest Esther,
---
It dawn. 
---
No work has begun, 
---
the morning is still holding the
ocean, 
---
not yet blue. 
---
But I can see past everything 
---
green to the horizon. 
---
And it is here in half-light 
---
that I imagine you. 
---
Six months have passed 
---
since our first correspondence, 
---
and much has changed.
---
A water boy from my parish died, 
---
taken by fever two nights past.
---
All their magic machinery 
---
and there's nothing could be done 
---
for this boy. 
---
It got me thinking about his family 
behind 
---
and the wife he'd never meet. 
---
He die so easy. 
---
Why he? 
---
His young life end, 
---
and not more than a word 
---
from the Yankee chief, 
---
'cept regret that the new boy ain't so quick. 
---
This morn I try to remember 
---
his small blackened face 
---
and cannot even recall his smile, 
---
though his hand give me water 
---
each and every day since I be here. 
---
Why this boy go out my mind, I ask? 
---
Tomorrow I too could be sucked into the ground 
---
without tears and ride the death train 
---
that pass through here five times a day. 
---
When I first come, 
---
a solid ox was the dream of this man. 
---
But I watch the splendid way 
---
the American gentlemen touch their fine machines 
---
and laugh away the jungle, and I know
---
what great and terrible things their sleep brings. 
---
And yet, your America sounds like a wondrous place, 
---
a man such as myself would be 
---
willing to surrender much for a 
---
taste of the modern world. 
---
Yes, I see beyond the tilting palms, 
---
through the mangroves 
---
and across the Caribbean sea 
---
to where you sit. 
---
I kneel beside you at this moment
and I tell you, 
---
I am a good strong man. 
---
What I've come to feel for you 
---
can best be described as love. 
---
I love you. 
---
There is no other way to say it, 
---
will you marry me?
---
Most Adoringly,
---
George

Why ya smiling so big? 
---
Close your mouth

'fore your teeth dry out.

## ESTHER:
He's asked me to marry him.
---
## MAYME:
What? No kidddin'.
---
## ESTHER:

---
## MAYME:
Show me.  
---
Our own Miss Esther.
---
## ESTHER:
He say he loves me.
---
## MAYME:
And do you love him?
---
## ESTHER:
As much as you can 
---
love a man you ain't seen. 
---
I'm thirty-five, 
---
Mayme, and he wants to many me. 
---
And there ain't gonna be 
---
no more opportunities 
---
I'm afraid. 
---
I've told him yes.
---
## MAYME:
Well, goddamn. 
---
I'm sure he's a fine man.
---
## ESTHER:
Yes, I suppose. 
---
Any man go through this much 
---
trouble to court a woman 
---
must have his virtues.
---
## MAYME:
I reckon.
---
## ESTHER:
He write that he arriving next month.
---
## MAYME:
So soon, you hardly ready.
---
## ESTHER:
I know. 
---
I'm getting married! 
---
Oh God, will you come 
and witness the ceremony?
---
## MAYME:
Me? 
---
You want to bring me 
---
around your new husband?
---
## ESTHER:
It would be nice to have a friend witness.
---
## MAYME:
No, I ain't been to church 
---
since I was seventeen. 
---
It ain't about you, 
---
it's just a promise I made to myself sometime ago. 
---
I ain't got nothing to say to God, 
---
and I don't think it's right 
---
to go up into some-body's home 
---
and you ain't on speaking terms.
---
## ESTHER:
It just a building.
---
## MAYME:
Just the same, 
---
I'd rather not be reminded. 
---
But thank you, 
---
it's a long time since I been 
---
invited anyplace proper.
---
## ESTHER:
Me too. 
---
## MAYME:
Hell, we ought to celebrate. 
---
Somebody give me this gin.
---
It look expensive. 
---
Whatcha think? 
---
Should I open it?
---
## ESTHER:
Sure. Why not. 
---
## MAYME:
We gonna toast 
---
to one less spinster in New York.
---
## ESTHER:
Oh God, 
---
I hope I ain't making a mistake.
---
## MAYME:
Oh, You'll be fine. 
---
You're about the most sensible 
---
gal I know.
---
Enjoy this feeling, honey.

It's a splendid,
Yes, indeed.

No, some nights, honey.

But here's to Esther,

you will be a beautiful bride,

and may happiness follow.

You're gonna go to socials

Drink lots of lemonade,

And you know,

## MRS. DICKSON:
Oh, Who is going to sit next to me 
at the table?
---
Well, there is Bertha, 
---
but she don't have no conversation. 
---
Oh, I could move Erma down close,  
---
but her and Bertha don't speak. 
---
It's gonna be a mess at that dinner table
---
That's for sure.
---
## ESTHER:
You wasn't always pleased 
---
with my conversation if I recall.
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
Who said that? 
---
Well, they lie.  
---
Oh no. 
---
What?
---
Really Esther?
---
My grandmother wouldn't even wear 
---
a collar like this
---
and she's a right proud Christian soldier. 
---
Yes.
---
## ESTHER:
Well, I like it. 
---
It's the most refined thing I own. 
---
I paid five whole dollars for it.
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
You gonna scare your gentleman, 
---
and it ain't worth five dollars of misery. 
---
You needn't be so prude. 
---
Your man'll have needs, 
---
and it'll be your duty to keep his 
---
member firmly at home. 
---
Yes.
---
## ESTHER:
Excuse me?
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
I shan't repeat it. 
---
You see, the thing is, 
---
is that sometimes 
---
he need pleasure 
---
in order for you to ensure 
---
your satisfaction.
---
Esther, 
---
sometimes a man needs a little help. 
---
Now it's a shame 
---
and a disappointment to have a husband 
---
with very little vigor. 
---
Yes.
---
You know, 
---
the way I see it. 
---
Now, I'm not an expert 
---
but the best of friends 
---
come together 
---
and they uh match it up well, 
---
but now listen, 
---
you can understand that um sometimes, 
---
you need to just understand 
---
that a man will test you 
---
and he'll try you, 
---
but don't let him beat on you.  
---
Don't take no shit off of him, 
---
you understand?
---
## ESTHER:
Mrs. Dickson.
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
Excuse me for saying, 
---
but if he raises his hand
once, 
---
he'll do it again. 
---
Now, I thought we should have this conversation 
---
but you come as an innocent 
---
and I'm a friend
---
I just wanted to 
---
to be able to talk to you plainly.
---
## ESTHER:
Well,Thank you, 
---
but I do believe I'm old enough 
---
to handle things myself.
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
Yeah, well, 
---
I just thought it should be said. 
---
Now whatcha want me to do with this dress?
---
## ESTHER:
It that bad?
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
Let's just say 
---
we'll give it to Deacon Wynn 
---
to let the church ladies fight over it. 
---
Yes. 
---
You really going to do this, 
---
aren't you?
---
## ESTHER:
You didn't expect me to be here for the rest of my life?
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
I sort of did. 
---
I got used to your sewing machine 
---
and your foot tapping round here.
---
## ESTHER:
Another gal will move into this room, 
---
and by supper you'll be fussing about something new.
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
Well, you say that with much certainty. 
---
You hurt my feelings, Miss Esther Mills. 
---
Eighteen years is a long time. 
---
I don't reckon I've known anybody else 
---
quite that long. 
---
It'll be lonesome.
---
## ESTHER:
You have plenty of suitors to keep you busy.
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
But not a working one of them.
---
You sure you want to do this.
---
## ESTHER:
Yes, I am. 
---
I stay on here, 
---
I'll turn into dust one day, 
---
get swept up and released 
---
into the garden without notice. 
---
I've finally found someone. 
---
Just as you found Mr. Dickson.
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
I married him, 
---
because I was thirty-seven years
old, 
---
no profession and there wasn't a 
---
decent colored man 
---
in New York City 
that would have me.
---
## ESTHER:
But you come to love each other.
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
I suppose. 
---
He give me some laughs. 
---
But you see, 
---
my mother wanted me to marry up. 
---
She was a washerwoman,
---
and my father was the very married minister of our mission. 
---
He couldn't even look into the church pews and see her, 
---
but she'd sit
there proudly 
---
every Sunday, hoping to gain God's favor. 
---
Marry good. 
---
She didn't want me to be embarrassed of my fingers 
---
the way she was of hers. 
---
I'd watched her put witch hazel 
---
and hot oil on her delicate hands, 
---
but they remained raw and chapped 
---
and she would put her hands 
---
and hide them in these gray gloves.
---
so no one could see em
---
when it was cold
---
her hands would bleed so bad 
---
but she'd just put them in hot water 
---
and she never flinched, 
---
kneading and scrubing the clothing clean. 
---
Folding and pressing for hours and hours, 
---
She just,
---
She just had a hard time
---
She'd keep the frayed gloves 
---
off of her clean clothes 
---
just to keep from getting bloodstains on em. 
---
She wouldn't even let me help.  
---
She didn't want my hands 
---
to have the mark of a laborer.
---
Marry up.
---
She didn't have any intention 
---
of entering her situation with love.
---
She said, "Look what love done to me".
---
That's what mother said. 
---
"Look what love done to me".
---
So I did what was necessary to gain. 
---
And I did. 
---
And I let them flatter me.  
---
I let these gentlemen flatter me, 
---
and I did things.
---
Not such pretty things.
---
for this marble mantle, 
---
and this gas stove in every room
---
a player piano 
---
and an indoor toilet.
---
## ESTHER:
But Mr. Dickson was a good man.
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
Bless his broke-down soul. 
---
He had fine suits 
---
and perfect diction, 
---
and was too high on opium 
---
to even notice he was married. 
---
But I would not be a washerwoman 
---
if it killed me.
---
And I have perfectly 
---
marvelous hands to prove it. 
---
But you 
---
you have godly fingers and a
means, 
---
and you deserve a gentleman. 
---
Why gamble it all away on some
common laborer?
---
## ESTHER:
Love.
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
Don't let no man 
---
have a part of your heart 
---
without getting a piece of his.

he's giving away thread with each purchase.

Yesterday, stress tonic.

I saw this morning
Mrs. Simons, 
---
Mrs. Simons my cousin's wife, 
---
go into Mr. Friedlander's.
---
His fabric is inferior,

I tell her this. 
---
But she wants the stress tonic
---
then go to the pharmacy I say. 
---
Where have you been? 
---
I've been going crazy. 
---
I couldn't bear to lose you to Friedlander.

No, I'm sorry.

Well, yes.

No, thank you, it's fine.

You have a lovely smile.

Let me show you the fabric.

## ESTHER:
Actually, I have a special request. 
---
I'll need fabric for a
wedding gown, 
---
something simple, Mr. Marks. 
---
The bride ain't got a lot of money 
to throw away.

## MARKS:
Satin? Chiffon? Cotton? Silk?

Yes. Tulle?

Satin, I think.

Silk.

Twenty?

Twenty-five cents. 
The bride will like.

It's too much.

How about this one?

Please.

I'm sure the rich lady who ordered this

didn't appreciate the delicacy of the fabric.

She gave no thought to who crafted this perfection,

the labor that went into making it.

How many hands touched it.

Look.

You deserve to wear it on your wedding day.

---
ain't no surprises.
---
We should say what we think now 
---
and get it out of the way.
---
## GEORGE:
I suppose from yuh letters
---
## ESTHER:
I described my character. 
---
And I think you'll find me
truthful. 
---
You're very handsome. 
---
More than I thought 
and I must say 
---
it do make me a little uncomfortable.  
---
And the other thing I think you must know, 
---
I ain't been with a man before. 
---
I been kissed and done some kissing, 
---
but you know what I'm saying. 
---
And it may be awkward on this first night, 
---
even if we man and wife 
---
## GEORGE:
Then we'll make it less awkward. 
---
---
Real nice, 
---
Pretty. I like it. 
---
## ESTHER:
Oh, uh. Wait. 
---
I made something for you. 
---
---
Here.
---
## GEORGE:
What it?
---
## ESTHER:
Japanese silk. 
---
Put it on. 
---
Ooo, Careful. 
---
It ain't too small?
---
## GEORGE:
Nah.. 
---
But I afraid, 
I soil it. 
---
## ESTHER:
Not yet.
---
## GEORGE:
Yuh got somethin' in mind?
---
## ESTHER:
Couldn't we wait a bit?
---
## GEORGE:
Minister say man and wife.
---
## ESTHER:
Please, 
---
I'd want to know more about your mother 
---
or about your birthplace, Bar-ba-dos. 
---
Something I don't know. 
---
'That wasn't in the letters. 
---
Something for us, right now. 
---
## GEORGE:
Like what? 
---
## ESTHER:
I come here from North Carolina at seventeen 
---
after my mother died of influenza, 
---
God bless her loving spirit. 
---
My father died two years later, 
---
he was a slave you see 
---
and didn't take to life as a freeman. 
---
He'd lost his tongue 
---
during a nasty fight over a chicken
---
when I was a baby, 
---
so I never heard him speak, 
---
no complaints, no praise, 
---
no gentle words, no goodbye. 
---
He was silent. 
---
Broken really. 
---
I come to this city by myself, 
---
worked my way North little by
little, 
---
picking berries in every state until I get here. 
---
An old woman in the rooming house 
---
teach me to sew intimate apparel, 
---
say folks'll pay you good money 
---
for your discretion. 
---
It was just about the best gift anybody give me. 
---
It was as though God kissed my
hands 
---
when I first pulled the fabric through the sewing machine
---
and held up a finished garment. 
---
I discovered everything I need in these hands. 
---
I wanted you to know that about me.
---
## GEORGE:
My parents were chattel 
---
born to children of chattel.
---
We cut sugar cane and die 
---
and that our tale 
---
for as long as anybody could say. 
---
Nothin' worthy of a retelling,
really. 
---
I come here so the story'll be different, that I hopin'. 
---
Now if yuh don't mind, 
---
I spent many nights on a hard wood floor, 
---
a bed be long overdue.  
---
We married. 
---
I ain't gonna commit no crime 'ere, 
---
[laughing]
a man and wife 
---
ain't got no quarrel in the bedroom.

## MAYME:
What is he like? 
---
## ESTHER:
He handsome enough.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
Come, what did he say when he saw you?
---
## ESTHER:
He ain't say much of nothing.
---
He just stood there for a moment 
---
regarding me with his eyes. 
---
Yellow, cotton and cane eyes.
---
I didn't have no tongue.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
He must be something of a romantic. 
---
He traveled halfway across the world 
---
for some promise on a paper.
---
## ESTHER:
And he still smell of salt 
---
and ground nuts. 
---
It make me sick and it make me excited.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
I was tipsy on my wedding night. 
---
I recall being in love with the notion of love, 
---
and everything took on a rosy
glow. 
---
Harry was foolish and confident 
---
and I was frightened to death.
---
## MAYME:
Is he as we imagined?
---
## ESTHER:
Yes, 
he is sturdy enough 
---
and quite a pleasure to behold.
---
His hands thick, stained dark from work. 
---
North Carolina field hands. 
---
But he got a melodious voice, 
---
each word a song unto itself.
---
And when he finally fell asleep
---
I placed my head on his chest, 
---
and listened for the song of cicadas
at dusk, 
---
and imagined the sweet aroma of the mango trees 
---
and the giant flamboyant with its crimson tears. 
---
## ESTHER:
Do you want me to fix you something?
---
## GEORGE:
I ain't really hungry, you know.
---
## ESTHER:
Where are you going? 
---
It Sunday. 
---
I promised Mrs. Dickson we'd dine with her 
---
this afternoon after the church social,
---
## GEORGE:
That woman ask too many questions for me liking.
---
## ESTHER:
That's what ladies do. 
---
She's just being attentive. 
---
---
## GEORGE:
Say Mrs. Armstrong, 
---
you got two dollars?
---
## ESTHER:
What for?
---
## GEORGE:
I need a proper hat 
---
if yuh want me to took for real
work. 
---
It near three months now, and this a farmer's hat I tot', 
---
The rag man wouldn't even give me a penny for it.
---
## ESTHER:
Two dollars. 
---
That's a lot of money. 
---
I told you I'd make
you a worsted suit. 
---
Right smart. 
---
## GEORGE:
C'mon, Mrs. Armstrong. 
---
Just two dollars.
---
## ESTHER:
But this is the last time. 
---
Hear? 
---
---
There.
---
## GEORGE:
That all you got?
---
## ESTHER:
Yes. Why do you need to go out?
---
## GEORGE:
I tell some fellas I stop off for a quick ale, 
---
I be back 'fore yuh know.
---
## ESTHER:
But it Sunday. 
---
I'll put on some tea, 
---
and sit, let me mend your shirt. 
---
You can't go out with a hole in your shirt. 
---
What will they say about your wife? 
---
I won't hear the end of it from Mrs. Dickson.
---
## GEORGE:
She a real madam. 
---
"Yuh working, George?" 
---
"Oh, null?"
---
I ain't been this idle since a boy in St. Lucy. 
---
But that busylickum air? 
'ear nothing.  
---
I got me pats on the back from white engineers, 
---
and a letter of recommendation
---
from the Yankee crew chief heself.
---
But 'ere, I got to watch buildings
---
going up left and right, 
---
steel girders as thick as tamarind trees, 
---
ten,twelve stories high. 
---
Thursday last I stood all day, 
---
it cold too, waidn' for the chief, 
---
waiting to interview. 
---
Do yuh have tools, boy? 
---
Yes! 
---
Do yuh know how to operate a machine, boy? 
---
Yes. 
---
But 'e point just so to the Irishman, the German, 
---
and the tall Norwegian who's at least 
---
fifty years plus five.
---
And I got more experience than the lot. 
---
I tell 'e so. 
---
Next time, 'e say. 
---
Next time, George. 
---
Can you believe? 
---
Then, when everyone gone, 
---
he pass me this damn note 
---
like it money.
---
Look.  
What do you think? 
---
---
## ESTHER:
I don't know what to say. 
---
I suppose he mean what he
say. 
---
## GEORGE:
Yeah, but what do you think? 
---
You think what he say true?
---
## ESTHER:
Why wouldn't he be truthful?  
---
Did you try over at that butcher's? 
---
Like I asked. 
---
I know they could use an extra man 
---
'cause it's always crowded in there. 
---
Especially on Friday.
---
## GEORGE:
I don' know. We'll see.
---
## ESTHER:
There are worse things you could do. 
---
And I thought maybe 
---
we could go to the church social 
---
before Mrs. Dickson's.
---
## GEORGE:
I ain't a church man, really. 
---
## ESTHER:
You do believe, don't you? 
---
Why in letters you said 
---
## GEORGE:
I say a lot of things. 
---
## ESTHER:
Please, I ain't been to a social. 
---
I sat up in Saint Martin's
for years, 
---
and didn't none of them church ladies bother with me
---
until I walked in on your arm, 
---
and now they want Mrs.
Armstrong over for tea.
---
## GEORGE:
Yuh and yuh monkey chaser yuh mean?
---
## ESTHER:
Oh no, that ain't so. 
---
Most of them folks ain't been nowhere to speak of. 
---
But they are fine people, 
---
and who knows where help will come from?
---
## GEORGE:
I want to build things, 
---
not polish silver or port luggage.
---
Them fine jobs for yuh Yankee gentlemen, 
---
but not me. 
---
I ain't come here for that. 
---
They'll have me a bootblack before long, 
---
let the damn Italians blacken their hands, I say. 
---
Mine been black long enough. 
---
This man at the saloon, 
---
smart looking fella, 
---
say the onliest way 
---
for a colored man in this country 
---
is for 'e to be 'e own man. 
---
Have 'e own business, 
---
otherwise he always be shining 
---
the white man nickel. 
---
You understand, no? 
---
And really, 
---
how it look to people. 
---
Me, sitting 'ere, waitin' on fortune, 
---
you out there courtin' it.
---
## ESTHER:
I am your wife, 
---
and whatever I got, yours. 
---
And George mind your smoking on the bed. 
---
The Chinaman two floors down
---
burn up that way. 
---
## GEORGE:
Listen, 
---
this man at the saloon talk about a man 
---
sellin' a stable with a dozen strong draft horses. 
---
'E in a bit of debt, 
---
and need money quick quick. 
---
A dozen horses for nothing. 
---
Did you 'ear what I say?
---
## ESTHER:
That saloon talk. 
---
That man'll take your money to
Shanghai. 
---
It just a dream, 
---
it ain't gonna feed you today.
---
## GEORGE:
You think I stupid?
---
## ESTHER:
No. 
---
But supposin' he honest, 
---
where would you get the
money 
---
for twelve horses?
---
## GEORGE:
Where, Mrs. Armstrong?  
---
Am I wrong?
---
## ESTHER:
My quilt? 
---
Never mind with that money. 
---
It just there and it gonna stay there.
---
## GEORGE:
Yuh a squirrel, for true. 
---
That's what yuh call them city
rats, no?
---
## ESTHER:
A squirrel ain't a rat. 
---
That money is for my beauty parlor,
---
I told you that.
---
## GEORGE:
[Laughs] 

That funny.
---
## ESTHER:
Why's that funny to you?
---
## GEORGE:
You ownin' a beauty parlor.
[laughing]
---
## ESTHER:
Yes. 
---
## GEORGE:
[laughing]
Look at yuh. 
---
How yuh know pretty from the lookin' glass? 
[laughing]
---
## ESTHER:
I make pretty things. 
---
## GEORGE:
I sorry, Mrs. Armstrong, 
---
I ain't know what I say. 
---
Yuh be real sweet, 
---
if you done up yuh hair, nice. 
---
Put a little paint on yuh
lips. 
---
## ESTHER:
I ain't that kind of woman.
---
## GEORGE:
No, yuh ain't. 
---
Please, Esther.
---
## ESTHER:
No. That eighteen years there.
---
## GEORGE: 
Yuh vex me so. 
---
Where's me shirt?
---
## ESTHER:
It ain't finished.  
---
Be careful, you'll tear 
---
## GEORGE:
I going o'er to the Empty Cup for an ale. 
---
I see yuh later.
---
## ESTHER:
That a notorious place.
---
## GEORGE:
How yuh know?
---
## ESTHER:
I know. 
---
Why are you so cross with me? 
---
You got your ale money 
---
and enough for God knows what else. 
---
## GEORGE:
Yes, it yuh nickel. 
---
How do t'ink that make me feel?
---
## ESTHER:
I come here with nothing.
---
## GEORGE:
Don't look at me so.
---
## ESTHER:
I slept in a cold church 
---
for nine days, 
and picked up breadcrumbs 
---
thrown to pigeons.
---
## GEORGE:
Yes. Yuh done good, 
---
but five hundred days digging
---
don't amount to nothing 'ere. 
---
It always gray, 
---
why it so gray? 
---
Work on the Isthmus, it hard, 
---
but at least the sun shine.
---
## ESTHER:
I know you here 'cause of me, 
---
and I want you to be happy.
---
We stood in that church, 
---
and and made a promise before God 
---
to cake care of each other. 
---
And that means something, 
---
even if it gray. 
---
You listenin'?
---
## GEORGE:
I listenin'.
---
## ESTHER:
You got a good arm George Armstrong, 
---
and I'd be proud to walk in on it 
---
whether it shining shoes or picking cotton.
---
---
## GEORGE:
I just tired of comin' home 
---
to put me hand in yuh pocket.
---
I off.
---
## ESTHER:
What about Mrs. Dickson and the social?
---
## GEORGE:
I be back for supper. 
---
---
## MARKS:
[humming to himself]
Here it is. 
---
Scottish wool, 
---
it isn't as expensive as one would think. 
---
It is very good.
---
## ESTHER:
[chuckle]
Are you humming a rag, Mr. Marks?
---
## MARKS:
No, it's a Romanian song. 
---
I can't remember the words. 
---
It is driving me mad.
---
## ESTHER:
[chuckles]
---
## ESTHER:
I'm glad to see that you 
---
fixed the button on your suit.
---
## MARKS:
Yeah. 
---
It was time, don't you think? 
---
You wanted Scottish wool, yes?
---
## ESTHER:
Scottish wool, yes. 
---
Oh, um. It's so heavy. 
---
Would you wear a suit made of this?
---
## MARKS:
Well, yes. 
---
You see how soft it is. 
---
I bought it from a gentleman 
---
who said it came from his village. 
---
He had a wonderful story about his mother 
---
caring for the sheep like small children. 
---
He said every night she would tell them a fairy tale, 
---
and each morning she would give the creatures 
---
a kiss and a sprinkle of salt. 
---
The neighbors would watch and
laugh. 
---
Watch and laugh. 
---
But when it came time to shear the animals, 
---
what wonderful wool they produced. 
---
Like no other.  
---
He could have been a thief for all I know, 
---
but the color is a lovely coffee, very subtle.
---
Don't you think? 
---
So I pay too much, 
---
but not enough for the quality.
---
Oh! Yes. 
---
I have something else to show you. 
---
It's here. 
---
Where is it?
---
Where are you? 
---
Ah, yes. Here we are.  
---
I almost let it go last week, 
---
but I was waiting for you. 
---
I wanted you to see it.
---
## ESTHER:
Oh, yes.
---
## MARKS:
I knew you'd like it. 
---
The wait was worth seeing your smile again. 
---
Miss Mills, if I may say 
---
## ESTHER:
Armstrong. 
---
## MARKS:
I apologize. 
---
I forget. 
---
I forget. 
---
## ESTHER:
It is pretty, thank you, 
---
but today I've come for fabric 
---
for a gentleman's suit. 
---
Next time.
---
## MARKS:
Yes. Ah, Just a minute, 
---
Ah, I have some other wools, 
---
gabardine, if you'd like to see? 
---
I have no story for them, 
---
but they are sturdy and reliable, 
---
will give you no problems.  
---
Next time.
---
## ESTHER:
Mr. Marks?
---
## MARKS:
Yes?  
---
Is there...?
---
## ESTHER:
No. 
---
No I'm sorry I can't do this. 
---
I thought could, 
---
but I can't. 
---
I can't come here anymore.
---
## MARKS:
Why do you say this? 
---
Did I do something to offend, 
---
tell me, did I...
---
template: overlap
## ESTHER:
No.

## MARKS:
Then 
---
## ESTHER:
Please, I think you know why. 
---
## MARKS:
How many yards will you need 
---
for the gentleman's suit?
---
## ESTHER:
Four yards. 
---
The Scottish wool 
---
and if you would,
---
please wrap the Valenciennes lace. 
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
He's gone to Europe.
---
## ESTHER:
I'm sorry to hear that.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
You needn't be. 
---
It's a relief actually. 
---
Some business obligation, 
---
I don't expect to see him for months. 
---
He'll find ways of prolonging his stay, no doubt. 
---
Anyway, I'm considering a visit with friends 
---
in Lenox this summer. 
---
It'll be good to escape the
city. 
---
Don't you think? 
---
You could come, of course, 
---
I'd recommend your services to several women.
---
## ESTHER:
I thank you, but I can't.  
---
Here's a strand of lace for your rose chemise. 
---
I know it ain't exactly what you wanted, but
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
I had almost forgot. 
---
I ordered it over four
weeks ago. 
---
Four whole weeks. 
---
template: overlap
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
It isn't like you to 

## ESTHER:
I been busy.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
Oh? Indeed. 
---
How is our Mr. Armstrong?
---
## ESTHER:
Good. 
---
Well, he....good. 
---
Work scarce, and 
---
he just get real restless 
---
He idle, but his pride...
---
I try, I do, 
---
but he ain't really take to this city.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
But he will. 
---
I am certain. 
---
Oh Esther, it must be wonderful 
---
to be in love.
---
## ESTHER:
I suppose. 
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
Is everything all right? 
---
## ESTHER:
Yes.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
Such a long face so early in the day. 
---
I won't allow it. 
---
Come.
---
## ESTHER:
I'd like to settle matters. 
Please. 
---
You ain't paid me in two months 
---
and I need the money.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
Of course, I hadn't realized.
---
You kwow what, 
---
I miss writing our letters. 
---
I do! 
---
template: overlap
## MRS> VAN BUREN:
I've been absolutely without purpose 

## ESTHER:
Let's not talk about the letters!
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
Fine, we won't.
---
## ESTHER:
I'm sorry, Mrs. Van Buren.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
Something is wrong.
---
## ESTHER:
No. Nothing. 
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
Esther, what is it?
---
## ESTHER:
The other day George asked me to read a letter. 
---
I took it in my hand and I lied. 
---
I lie every day. 
---
And I'm a Christian woman.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
We do what we must, no? 
---
We are ridiculous creatures sometimes. 
---
## ESTHER:
Do you love Mr. Van Buren?
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
I am a married women, 
---
such a question is romantic.
---
## ESTHER:
But I fear my love belongs someplace else.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
And why is that?
---
## ESTHER:
I shouldn't say. 
---
No, I can't. 
---
Perhaps I'm wrong.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
Perhaps not. 
---
I'm sorry. 
---
I didn't mean to do that. 
---
I'm sorry. Please don't go. 
---
I just wanted to show you 
---
what it's like to be treated lovingly.
---
## ESTHER:
Don't say that. 
---
You don't love me.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
How do you know? 
---
Please. 
---
We will forget this 
---
and we'll continue to be friends.
---
## ESTHER:
Friends? 
---
How we friends? 
---
When I ain't never been through your front door. 
---
You love me? 
---
What of me do you love?
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
Esther, you are the only one 
---
who's been in my boudoir in all these months. 
---
And honestly, 
---
it's only in here with you, 
---
that I feel happy. 
---
Please, I want us to be friends?
---
## ESTHER:
I'm sorry. I can't.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
Coward! 
---
I'm sorry.

## MAYME:
I've saved up every penny I have. 
---
It's been two months 
---
and I want something new, Esther. 
---
Simple, this time, 
---
without all the pronouncement. 
---
Something a young gal might wear 
on her 
---
wedding night.
---
## ESTHER:
Wedding night? 
---
What ain't I heard? 
---
I don't believe those words 
---
got any place in your mouth.
---
## MAYME:
Seriously.
[laughing]
---
## ESTHER:
What's going on?
---
C'mon, are you gonna tell me?
---
## MAYME:
It ain't nothing really. 
---
A fella, perhaps.
---
## ESTHER:
I thought you didn't feel nothing for these fools.
---
## MAYME:
Nothing ain't never felt so good.
---
## ESTHER:
Who is he?
---
## MAYME:
Well, he ain't nobody really, 
---
but he real sweet. 
---
Like a schoolboy almost. 
---
We call him Songbird, 'cause he sing to speak.
---
He come in like all them others. 
---
Hands crude and calloused, 
---
a week's wage in his pocket. 
---
But when we done I didn't want him to leave 
---
so I asked him to have a drink. 
---
Fool drunk up all my liquor, 
---
but it ain't bother me none. 
---
In fact, I was fixin' to run out and git some more, 
---
but he put his hands around my waist, 
---
real gentle and pulled me close.
---
I actually wanted him to kiss me,
[laughing] 
---
I didn't even mind his sour tongue
in my mouth, 
---
I wanted him there, 
---
inside me.
[laughing] 
---
He ain't like a lot of the colored men 
---
who pass through here  
---
anger about their touch. 
---
Naw, he a gentleman. 
---
Comes three times a week 
---
on schedule like the iceman. 
---
He was just here last night until midnight, 
---
only he don't ever stay later. 
---
He just leaves his scent, 
---
which lingers until two A.M. or
three, 
---
and just I lie awake 
---
until it disappears.
---
## ESTHER:
He sounds wonderful.
---
## MAYME:
Yeah, I reckon.
---
## ESTHER:
What?
---
## MAYME:
Whatcha think?

He got a wife. 
---
Yeah. A rich one. 
---
Troubles him, he say. 
---
Troubles him to no end. 
---
You should hear him go on about this poor gal. 
---
Made me feel bad for her.
---
## ESTHER:
She terrible, I'm sure. 
---
But just the same, 
---
you on uneasy ground.
---
## MAYME:
You find it shocking?
---
## ESTHER:
Yes, I find it shocking.
---
## MAYME:
Hush your mouth, 
---
you wouldn't understand. 
---
Oh, you want to see what my songbird give me? 
---
---
And you know, 
---
I don't usually accept gifts from men,
---
but when he give me this, 
---
Wha, it took my breath away. 
---
It's so pretty. 
---
Look Esther. 
---
Feel it.
---
## ESTHER:
He give you this?
---
## MAYME:
Yup.
---
## ESTHER:
He must like you a bunch 
---
to give you something so fine.
---
## MAYME:
What can say, 
---
the man got taste, honey.
---
## ESTHER:
I only seen fabric like this just once before. 
---
It's Japanese silk.
---
## MAYME:
How you know?
---
## ESTHER:
It's expensive fabric. 
---
Very hard to find. 
---
You see the pictures were embroidered 
---
by an imperial artist, 
---
he signed it there.
---
He give you this?
---
## MAYME:
He say I his gal. 
---
Only this time a little part of me 
---
is hoping he telling the truth.
---
## ESTHER:
What about his wife?
---
## MAYME:
What about her? 
---
I'm sure she just a sorry gal.
---
## ESTHER:
How you know she ain't good? 
---
That he just saying what you want to hear. 
---
That his words are a smooth tonic 
---
to make you give out what ain't free. 
---
How you know his wife ain't good?
---
## MAYME:
I don't know. 
---
But do it matter?
---
## ESTHER:
Yeah it do. 
---
You ever think about where they go 
---
after they leave here? 
---
Who washes their britches 
---
after they been soiled in your bed?
---
## MAYME:
No, I don't actually. 
---
Why would I?
---
## ESTHER:
'Cause there's some poor woman out there waiting,
---
getting up every five minutes, 
---
each time a carriage pass the window
---
or a dog bark.
---
Who thinks a great deal of her husband, 
---
thinks so much of him 
---
that she don't bother to ask questions, 
---
she just know that there are places 
---
that he go that gentlewomen don't belong.
---
## MAYME:
I don't want to hear it.
---
## ESTHER:
She thinks he's playing cards or simply restless. 
---
But still when the door opens and he lies down next to her, 
---
that poor stupid woman don't feel angry, 
---
because his body is warm and she ain't alone.
---
## MAYME:
What?! 
---
You troubled because he married? 
---
They all married. 
---
You ain't completely clean of this business. 
---
Truth. 
---
No, I don't care to think about them women. 
---
I don't care to think about the kind of lives 
---
that keep them sitting in their windows, 
---
worrying while their husbands 
---
## ESTHER:
I pity your heart. 
---
You are the worst sort of scavenger.
---
## MAYME:
What's wrong wit you?
---
## ESTHER:
I don't feel so good. That's all.
---
## MAYME:
I thought you'd be happy for me.
---
## ESTHER:
I think I'm gonna go home, 
---
if you don't mind.

I look at them every day.

I have one that looks as though it's weeping,

cause the words fade away into nothing,

and another that looks as if it's been through a hard day,
---
because there's a smudge of dirt at each corner, 
---
and it smells of kerosene 
---
and burnt sugar. 
---
But I can't tell you what it say, because I don't read. 
---
I can't tell whether there are any truths, 
---
but I keep them, 'cause George give me his heart, 
---
though it covered in mud and filthy, 
---
but he give it to me in one of these letters. 
---
And I believed him. 
---
I believed him! 
---
But you ain't the man in these letters, 
---
because that gentleman would have thanked me. 
---
'Who wrote them letters, George? 
---
Tell me!  
---
YOU TELL ME!
---
---
## GEORGE:
An old mulatto man. 
---
I paid him ten cents for each letter,
---
and ten cents extra for the fancy writing.
---
## ESTHER:
I ain't really Mrs. Armstrong, 
---
am I? 
---
I been holding on to that, 
---
and that woman ain't real. 
---
We more strangers now than on
the eve of our wedding.

At least I knew who I was back then.

But I ain't gonna let you hurt that woman.

No! She's a good decent woman
and worthy.

Half my life bent at the machine,

and I give it to him, 
---
just like that.

## MAYME:
Oh, Esther.

---
trying to make something, 
---
I just kept sewing together anything I could find

until I had a strip a mile long, 
---
so long it fill up the apartment. 
---
Do you know where he is, Mayme?
---
## MAYME:
How would I know?

## ESTHER:
Because you're wearing the jacket 
---
that I give him on our wedding night.
---
## MAYME:
OH! How come you ain't say nothing before?

## ESTHER:
What am I gonna say?

Yeah, yeah.

Last night Songbird come around the saloon 
---
in a new suit with bottomless pockets, 
---
throwing dice all around, 
---
boasting of easy money. 
---
I ask him where he get the money from
---
and he say his luck turn 
---
and he was gonna ride it out. 
---
If you can imagine that. 
---
He said he wanted draft horses. 
---
The world changing
---
and he wants big strong horses. 
---
He made me laugh. 
---
He promised to take me someplace special, 
---
and I ain't have nothing nice to
wear. 
---
And honestly it made me think about
---
how long it been since I done something for myself. 
---
Gone someplace like you said, 
---
where a colored woman could 
put up her feet 
---
and get treated good for a change. 
---
And I see the dice rolling, 
---
and I think Lord, God, 
---
wouldn't a place like that be wonderful. 
---
And the more those dice roll, 
---
that place get a little further away. 
---
Until it all gone. 
---
I put my arms around this man, 
---
and I know who he is. 
---
He George.
---
And uh maybe I known all along.
