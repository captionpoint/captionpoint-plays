## MRS. DICKSON:
Don't be fresh, Lionel. 
---
I know your mother
since before the war.  
---
Ha, Ha, Ha,
Well, there you are.
---
Mr. Charles was admiring the bread pudding 
---
and I told him that
our Esther made it. 
---
It seems he has a sweet tooth.
---
## ESTHER:
Mr. Charles is overly generous, 
---
come, the pudding ain't
nothing special.
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
And did I mention that our own most available Mr.Charles 
---
has been promoted to head Bellman 
---
at just about the finest
hotel in New York? Yes.
---
## ESTHER:
Mmmm, but he still fetching luggage.
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
Not just any kinda luggage, 
---
high-class luggage.
---
## ESTHER:
And is high-class luggage easier to carry?
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
I reckon it is easier to haul silk than cotton, 
---
if you know what I'm saying.  
---
Yes.
---
## ESTHER:
I see that he is also wearing cashmere this evening.
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
Well now. 
---
It's easy to tell about a man by where he shops, 
---
than his practiced conversation. 
---
'Cause any man with 
enough tonic can talk smooth, 
---
but not every man has the good
sense to shop at
---
## ESTHER and MRS. DICKSON:
Saperstein's.
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
[laughs]
That's lovely.
---
## ESTHER:
It's for Corinna Mae's wedding night.
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
Don't tell me you've been in here all evening?
---
Corinna Mae is getting ready to leave with her fiancé.
---
## ESTHER:
I wish I could find my party face.
---
It really is a lovely
affair. 
---
You done a fine job.
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
Come now, it ain't over yet. 
---
Put down your sewing,
---
put it aside
---
straighten yourself up. 
---
There. 
---
You gonna have a dance before
this evening's out.
---
## ESTHER:
Please, Mrs. Dickson, 
---
I can't, really. 
---
I'll just stand there
like a wallflower.
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
Nonsense, 
Ester, 
---
you don't have to stand there like a wallflower
---
You see, I have been dancing 
---
a half a dozen times,
---
and my feet are just about worn out.
---
## ESTHER:
If I had your good looks I'd raise a bit of dust myself.
---
Ain't nobody down there interested in me.
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
Oh, you're being silly now, Ester. 
---
Now, you've been moping
around here for days. 
---
What's the matter?
---
## ESTHER:
If you must know, 
---
I turned thirty-five Thursday past.
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
Oh my Lord, I forgot, 
---
I sure did. 
---
You know with all that going on with Corinna Mae 
---
it slipped my mind. 
---
Happy birthday, my sweet Esther. 
---
## ESTHER:
It's fine. 
---
You had all this to prepare for. 
---
And I been living in this house for so long, 
---
I reckon I'm just another piece
of furniture.
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
Never. 
---
You were a godsend when you come
to me at seventeen. 
---
Yes. 
---
I remember how young and sweet you were
---
carrying a sack full of overripe fruit 
---
smelling like a Georgia orchid.
---
## ESTHER:
And now? 
---
Twenty-two girls later, 
---
if you count Lerleen.
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
Lerleen.
---
## ESTHER:
That's how many of these parties I have had to go to 
---
and play merry. 
---
And I should be happy for them, 
---
I know, but each time I think
---
why ain't it me. 
---
Silly Corinna Mae, ain't got no brain at all, 
---
and just as plain as flour.
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
Your time will come, child.
---
## ESTHER:
What if it don't? 
---
template: noise
laughter from party
---
Oh, and, listen to her laughing. 
---
God forgive me, 
---
but I hate her laughter, 
---
I hate her happiness 
---
and I feel simply awful for saying so. 
---
And I'm afraid if I go back in there, 
---
she'll see it all over my face, 
---
and it's her day.
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
There are a number of young men open to your smile. 
---
But a sour face don't bring nothing but contempt. 
---
You know our Mr. Charles has had 
---
three servings of your bread pudding.
---
## ESTHER:
And he shouldn't have had any.
---
He weighs nearly as much as your horse.
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
Nonsense, he weighs more then poor Jessup.
---
Shhh. He is a good man, 
---
and poised for success. Yes.
---
## ESTHER:
But he's been coming to these parties for near two years
---
and if he ain't met a woman, 
---
I'd bet it ain't a woman he after. 
---
I've been warned about men in refined suits. 
---
But still, Esther would be
lucky enough for his attention, 
---
that's what your thinking. 
---
Well, I ain't giving up so easy.
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
Good for you. 
---
But there are many a cautionary
tale 
---
bred of overconfidence. 
---
Yes. 
---
But you shouldn't be so particular.
---
## ESTHER:
Well, I ain't going down there 
---
to be paraded like some featherless bird. 
---
I'm sorry; 
---
would you kindly take this down to Corinna Mae?
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
I'll do no such thing. 
---
You carry it down there yourself. 
---
It's tough Esther, 
---
It's tough to be a colored woman in this city.
---
I know, you know that
---
and Corinna Mae all she got is her
honey-colored skin,
---
but you got nimble fingers
---
And your smart and good
---
and you deserve all the attention in that room, 
---
all I ask is that you
come and toast her 
---
the way I know she'd toast you. 
---
Put aside your feelings
---
and don't say nothing about Sarah's music playing, 
---
She trying.
---
For God's sake, this a party not a wake.
---
## ESTHER:
Let me fix my hair. 
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
Oh, and I thought you would be wanting this.
---
This letter come this morning, 
---
and I didn't want to forget.
---
## ESTHER:
Who'd be writing me?
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
Mr. George Armstrong.
---
## ESTHER:
He ain't somebody I know. 
---
Armstrong? 
---
There was an Armstrong that attended my church, 
---
but he dead a long time now.
---
Will you read the letter to me? 
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
I got a house full of people. 
---
You best be reminding me tomorrow. 
---
Now I'll see you downstairs, shortly. 
---
And there's plenty of fruit and punch left 
---
and it's better than New Year's, 
---
so best be coming on down.
---
I'm making sure that everybody leaves this party happy. 
---
## GEORGE:
Dear Miss Mills,
---
My name is George Armstrong. 
---
I work in Panama alongside
Carson Wynn, 
---
your deacon's son. 
---
We digging a big hole across the
land, 
---
they say one day ships will pass from one ocean to the next. 
---
It is important work, we told. 
---
If importance be measured by how
many men die, 
---
then this be real important work. 
---
One man drops for every twenty feet of canal dug, 
---
like so many flies. 
---
Carson say if we eat a can of sardines, 
---
they'll protect us against the mosquitoes and fever. 
---
I say, not as long as we be digging. 
---
Lord knows our minds deserve a bit of shade. 
---
But ain't such a thing to be had, not here at least. 
---
Don't think me too forward, 
---
but I thought it would be nice to
have someone to think about, 
---
someone not covered from head to
toe in mud, 
---
someone to ward off this awful boredom. 
---
Carson speaks so highly of his church 
---
that I find comfort in his recollections. 
---
I ask if I may write you? 
---
And if you so please, 
---
I'd welcome your words.
---
Sincerely,
George Armstrong

## MRS. VAN BUREN:
I feel exposed. 
---
I think the straps need to be
tightened, Esther.
---
## ESTHER:
No ma'am, 
---
that's the way it's meant to be, 
---
but I'll add a little more fabric to the
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
No, no, 
---
if this is what you made for that
singer, 
---
it is what I want. 
---
All right. 
---
I'm coming out. 
---
---
Oh God, I look ridiculous, 
---
and I'm behaving absolutely
foolishly, 
---
but I'm not sure what else to do. 
---
Look at me. 
---
I've spent a fortune on feathers 
---
and every manner of accouterment. 
---
They've written positively splendid
things 
---
about me in the columns this season.
---
## ESTHER:
I'm sure they did.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
But does it matter? 
---
Has he spent an evening at home? 
---
Or even noticed 
---
that I've painted the damn boudoir
vermilion red?
---
## ESTHER:
You look lovely, Mrs. Van Buren.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
Ha! I feel like a tart 
---
from the Tenderloin.
---
Granted I've never been, 
---
but I'm told. 
---
Are you sure 
---
this is what you made for that singer?
---
## ESTHER:
It is identical to the stitching. 
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
And you say the French women are wearing these?
---
## ESTHER:
So I'm told.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
I don't believe it. 
---
It hardly seems decent. 
---
But I suppose the French aren't known for their modesty. 
---
## ESTHER:
Well, it the rage. 
---
Some ladies ain't even wearing corsets in private.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
Is that true?
---
## ESTHER:
Most gals don't like 'em, 
---
even fine ladies like yourself.
---
Truth is I ain't known a man to 
---
court pain for a woman's glance.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
You're not one of those 
---
suffragettes, are you?
---
## ESTHER:
Oh God no, Mrs. Van Buren.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
Indeed. 
---
I'd just as soon not tamper 
---
in men's business. 
---
## ESTHER:
Talk and a nickel 
---
will buy you five cents worth of trouble.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
It's come to this. 
---
If Mother dear could see 
---
what has become of her peach in the big city. 
---
Do we really need all of these 
---
dangling things?
---
## ESTHER:
Oh, I hope you ain't mind, 
---
I added a touch of beading
---
along the trim.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
It is different.
---
## ESTHER:
Do you like it?
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
I confess, I almost do. 
---
It's a bit naughty.
---
[Giggles.]
---
Yes , I might even wear it beneath my gown tonight. 
---
Do you think anyone will notice? 
---
It is the annual Gardenia Ball, 
---
quite the event of the season.
---
## ESTHER:
So I hear.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
And do you know what that means? 
---
They'll all be there, 
---
parading their good fortune. 
---
and I'll have to smile, be polite, 
---
because I'm known for that, 
---
but I will dread every last minute, 
---
every bit of forced conversation 
---
with the Livingstons and the Babcocks. 
---
They want to know. 
---
All of them do.
---
"When are you going to have a child, Evangeline?" 
---
And my answer is always the same, 
---
"Why we're working on it, dear, speak to Harold."
---
And dear Harry will be in a sour mood for a week. 
---
You probably don't even know what I'm talking about. 
---
Have you children?
---
## ESTHER:
No, Mrs. Van Buren. 
---
I ain't been married.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
Really? 
---
May I tell you something?
---
## ESTHER:
Yes. If you like.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
I've given him no children.  
---
I'm afraid I can't. 
---
It's not for the lack of trying. 
---
One takes these things for granted, 
---
you assume when it comes time that it will happen,
---
and when it doesn't who is to blame? 
---
They think it's vanity that's
kept me childless, 
---
I've heard the women whispering. 
---
If only I were that vain. 
---
But it's like he's given up.
---
## ESTHER:
But, you're so beautiful.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
You think so?
---
## ESTHER:
Yes. 
---
I can't imagine he'd ever lose interest.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
But he has found other interests. 
---
Trust me. 
---
You will keep this between us? 
---
I'm told you're discreet.
---
## ESTHER:
I just sew, missus. 
---
I don't hear anything 
---
that I ain't supposed to.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
I'd rather not be divorced, 
---
at my age it would prove disastrous.
---
## ESTHER:
Do you think there's something 
---
wrong with a woman alone?
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
What I think is of little consequence. 
---
If I were brave 
---
I would collect my things right now 
---
and I would find a small clean room someplace 
---
on the other side of the park. 
---
No, further even. 
---
And I'd 
---
But it isn't a possibility, is it? 
---
## ESTHER:
I don't know that I'll marry.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
Oh, of course you will, 
---
it's all about finding
the right gentleman.
---
## ESTHER:
Well ma'am, I don't mean to speak out of turn. 
---
But, I been working since I was nine years old with barely 
---
a day's rest. 
---
In fact, the other evening 
---
I was at my sewing machine 
---
and I stopped working 
---
and all this time had passed, 
---
gone. 
---
Years really. 
---
And I known right there 
---
that some things ain't meant to be. 
---
And that's all right, ain't it? 
---
And I wouldn't have thought no more about it, 
---
but then I got this 
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
Yes?
---
## ESTHER:
I'm ashamed to say. 
---
At my age it foolish, I know.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
What is it?
---
## ESTHER:
A gentleman.
---
A gentleman has taken interest in me.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
A gentleman. Really? 
---
How wonderful! 
---
Is he respectable?
---
## ESTHER:
I don't know, 
---
I mean, I don't know him actually. 
---
I got me this letter from Panama. 
---
A man in Panama. 
---
He wrote about two weeks back. 
---
I been carrying it around since. 
---
But, I ain't so sure should answer.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
And why not?
---
## ESTHER:
I ain't much of a writer.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
Oh 
---
## ESTHER:
No, I ain't a writer at all. 
---
The fact is 
---
I...I can't read.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
Do you have the letter? 
---
May I see it? 
---
---
Panama. 
---
He has lovely penmanship, 
---
that's important. 
---
He isn't careless with his stroke,
---
now that's the mark of a thoughtful man. 
---
It's a good thing, I believe.
---
## ESTHER:
I won't respond, of course, 
---
if it ain't appropriate.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
Nonsense. 
---
He's halfway across the world.
---
I'm sure he's perfectly harmless. 
---
He's just a bit lonesome is all.
---
## ESTHER:
But, if I have Mrs. Dickson 
---
over at the rooming house
help me, 
---
she'll get all up in my business. 
---
And she's got an opinion
about everything 
---
and I'd rather not be questioned or lectured
---
or bothered. 
---
She's just about the busiest person that
---
in any event,
---
she said to rip it up promptly, 
---
a decent woman wouldn't resort to such a dalliance.
---
But as you can see he has taken interest in me.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
Would you like me to help you write to him, Esther?
---
## ESTHER:
I couldn't ask.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
You needn't, I insist.
---
## ESTHER:
I never done this before.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
Nor have I.
---
## ESTHER:
Maybe it ain't such a good idea, 
---
Mrs. Van Buren. 
---
I ain't really got much to say.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
Of course you do 
---
## ESTHER: 
No, I don't! 
---
I live in a rooming house
---
with seven unattached women 
---
and sew intimate apparel for ladies,
---
but that ain't for a gentleman's eyes. 
---
Sure I can tell him everything there
is to know about fabric, 
---
but that hardly seems a life worthy of words.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
It is a beginning. 
---
Come on Esther, don't be shy.  
---
Now, how shall we start?
---
## ESTHER:
I don't know.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
What sort of things do you like to do?
---
## ESTHER:
I...I go to church every Sunday, 
---
well practically, 
---
I don't really listen to the sermons, 
---
I just like the company 
---
and the singing of course 
---
And on Tuesdays 
---
I take the trolley down-town to Orchard Street, 
---
and I climb five flights, 
---
in darkness, 
---
to this tiny apartment. 
---
And, when I open the door my eyes are met. 
---
He keeps a wealth of fabric in
that apartment. 
---
He got everything you need, 
---
even things you don't know you need 
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
Esther, you're jumping a bit ahead of your-self.  
---
Shall we begin 
---
with "Dear Mr.Armstrong —"
---
## ESTHER:
Yes. 
---
That's good. 
---
"Dear Mr. Armstrong —"
---
## GEORGE:
Dear Miss Mills,
---
template: overlap
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
"I received your letter " 

## GEORGE:
I received your letter. 
---
[background forest sounds]

It two months in the coming, so please forgive me, 
---
I've already written you twice since. 
---
I am most happy to make your acquaintance, 
---
and I'm anxious to hear all about you.
---
As for me, I'd like to report on our good progress, 
---
but it isn't the case. 
---
This canal seem a near-impossible mission, 
---
but here we be, digging until day-end 
---
bathed in mud up to our necks. 
---
They say 
---
a mad Frenchman dreamed up this Panama project, 
---
and convinced the devil to give him an army of workers. 
---
The price, 
---
this great fissure across the land 
---
that reach right into the earth's belly. 
---
Indeed, 
---
chaos is a jackhammer away, 
---
that's what be said here anyway. 
---
But when the great oceans meet 
---
and the gentlemen celebrate, 
---
will we colored men 
---
be given glasses to raise? 
---
Today we severed the roots 
---
of a giant Flamboyant, 
---
and watched it tumble to the ground. 
---
I stood thigh-deep 
---
in crimson blossoms, 
---
swathed in the sweet aroma of death
---
and wondered how a place so beautiful 
---
could become a morgue.
---
But the days aren't all bad. 
---
If you take a moment 
---
to listen to the forest around us 
---
there is so much life 
---
just out of sight. 
---
And there be men from every corner of the Caribbean, 
---
sharing tales around fires,
---
heads light on rum and laughter.
[laughs] 
---
But now, I read your letter. 
---
I see you sitting at your sewing machine. 
---
I hear the sound of the wheel
turning, 
---
the tiny stitches drawing together the pieces of satin. 
---
They got machines here 
---
that take six men to operate, 
---
and slice through stone like butter. 
---
All this wonder and waste, 
---
but your letter be the most splendid thing 
---
and shall ride in me pocket, 
---
until the next.
---
Yours Considerately,
---
George Armstrong

Hi, Mr. Marks?

Am I too early?

No, not at all.

Come in. Come in.

I've a number of new things to show you.

Japanese silk,

your special order for the lady on
Fifth Avenue.

It took me nearly one month to find this very piece.

I had to go everywhere.

Lovely. Yes?

Lovely.

Look at how finely embroidered.

Beautiful.

Next to nothing is too much for me.

You know my answer.

What will I do with it?

Make something lovely for yourself.

It will be wasted on me.

You'll never see this again.

I guarantee.

I'll let our Fifth
Avenue lady cover the difference.

How about that?

I see how much you like.

I promise it is the very best quality.

She don't know what she has, 
---
she don't come down here to feel the fabric herself, 
---
to feel the difference, 
---
the texture, 
---
she don't know how remarkable a weave.
---
## ESTHER:
I could make a shawl.
---
## MARKS:
Or a smoking jacket 
---
for your gentleman, perhaps.
---
## ESTHER:
My gentleman? 
---
Oh no.  
---
You've distracted me, Mr. Marks. 
---
You always get me to buy something 
---
I don't need.
---
## MARKS:
When I see something of quality, 
---
I like to share with my favorite customers. 
---
Everybody want the same thing. 
---
But you want different. 
---
I like that.
---
## ESTHER:
Thank you. 
---
## MARKS:
Ah, look at that. 
---
I have lost a button. 
---
I buy at the docks yesterday morning, 
---
it come right offa ship from the Orient, 
---
I see it and think Esther Mills will like.
---
Everybody else gabardine, wool, nainsook. 
---
But it isn't often that something 
---
so fine and delicate enters the
store. 
---
Look at the way the gold thread is interwoven; 
---
a hand took the time to gently wind it 
---
through each and every stitch 
---
like a magician. 
---
It is magnificent, yes. 
---
I can see from your hands 
---
that you are blessed with the needle and the thread, 
---
which means you'll never be without warmth.
---
## ESTHER:
I'm afraid it was either learn to sew 
---
or turn back sheets for fifty cents a day.
---
## MARKS:
You make it sound too simple. 
---
My father sew, 
---
my brother sew, yes, 
---
for the finest families. 
---
But I don't have the discipline, 
---
the fingers. 
---
Look at the size of these hands. 
---
Like carnati, 
---
Romanian sausage.
---
## ESTHER:
[laughs]
---
I wish for your hands. 
---
## ESTHER:
It's fruit dye. 
---
Am I right? 
---
It smells like
---
## MARKS:
an imperial palace, 
---
it is signed by the artist 
---
Oh, right there. 
---
I wouldn't be surprised 
---
if it was created for an empress.
---
## ESTHER:
Huh. 
---
You really want me to buy this, don't you? 
---
All right, 
---
it means I'll go without sugar for a week, 
---
will that make you happy?
---
## MARKS:
It makes you happy, 
---
it makes me happy.
---
## ESTHER:
I do want it.
---
The color won't rub off on you.
---
## MARKS:
No, no. 
---
I'm sorry. 
---
No, it's not that. 
---
Please. 
---
My religious belief 
---
doesn't permit me to touch a woman 
---
who isn't my wife or my relative.
---
## ESTHER:
Oh, I see.
---
## MARKS:
It is the rabbinical law, 
---
not mine.
---
## ESTHER:
Your wife must be a happy woman.
---
## MARKS:
I am not married. 
---
Not yet. 
---
My fiancée is in Romania.
---
Um, my family made the arrangement years ago.
---
## ESTHER:
Oh? 
---
I bet you miss her something awful. 
---
## MARKS:
I haven't ever met her, actually.

Yeah

My daddy gave me twelve
lashes

with a switch

for playing this piece in our parlor.

One for each year I studied the piano.

He was too proper to like anything
colored,

was about the worst crime

You must have gotten a lot of licks in your time.

Yeah, baby,

I wasn't born this black and blue.

Anything else, Mistress?

## MAYME:
Hush your mouth,

you're far too sweet for sarcasm. 
---
---
## MAYME:
That's for me?
---
## ESTHER:
I made one just like it 
---
for a lady on Fifth Avenue.
---
## MAYME:
It's so pretty. 
---
That's for me? 
---
No kidding? 
---
Can I try it on?
---
## ESTHER:
Of course you can.
---
## MAYME:
Feel it. 
---
Oooo. It feels like Fifth Avenue does. 
---
You outdone yourself this time, honey.
---
## ESTHER:
Stop talking and put it on.  
---
And look at the flowers, ain't they sweet? 
---
It took me a whole day just to sew them on. 
---
## MAYME:
For shame. 
---
This the prettiest thing

anybody ever made for me. 
---
Truly.
---
## ESTHER:
You know that white lady I talk about sometime, 
---
Oh hold on 
---
She keep asking me 
---
what they be wearing up in the Tenderloin. 
---
All that high breeding 
---
and she want what you wearing.
---
## MAYME:
No kidding?
---
## ESTHER:
What she got, you want, 
---
what you got, she want.
---
## MAYME:
Onliest, I ain't got the money to pay for it.  
---
Whatcha think? 
---
Do I look like a Fifth Avenue bird?
---
## ESTHER:
Grand. 
---
You look grand. 
---
Mr. Marks say, 
---
that satin foulard was made for the 
---
finest ladies in Paris.
---
## MAYME:
No kidding.
---
## ESTHER:
I wasn't going to buy it. 
---
But, oh God, 
---
if he didn't talk me into it.
---
## MAYME:
Mr. Marks?
---
Who is this Mr. Marks?
---
## ESTHER:
He just a salesman. That's all.
---
## MAYME:
Mmm, It sound to me like you bit sweet on him.

## ESTHER:
Me?

Oh no, he a Jew. 
---
## MAYME:
And?

I been with a Jew,

with a Turk even.

And let me tell ya,

a gentle touch is gold in any country.

## ESTHER:
I see the bodice is bit snug
---

Is he handsome?

## ESTHER:
I ain't noticed.

Good patient, Esther.

Come, he wouldn't be your first,

would he?

I ain't listenin'.

You dear thing. 
[Laughing]
---
No kidding.

I can't even remember what it was like. 
---
Ain't that something.
---
## ESTHER:
Let's not talk about this.
---
## MAYME:
Mercy, what you must think of me. 
---
## ESTHER:
And if you must know, 
---
I'm being courted by a gentleman.
---
## MAYME:
Courted by a gentleman. 
---
Beg my pardon. 
---
Not that Panama
man? 
---
Oh come on, 
---
don't tell me you still writing him.
---
## ESTHER:
He writing me.

## MAYME:
You'd rather a man

then down Broadway.

What you expecting him to arrive in the mail

## ESTHER:
Please don't make sport, Mayme.

## MAYME:
I'm just playing with you.

## ESTHER:
I ain't expectin' nothing.

## MAYME:
Sure you are. 
---
Sure you are, honey. 
---
Who ain't?

I am a concert pianist

And Madame always takes tea

twice a week with her dear friend

Miss Esther Mills,

who's known in circles for

for um...
---
For what? 
---
I forget.  
---
Come on, Miss Esther, 
---
don't be proud.
---
## ESTHER:
I own a quaint beauty parlor for colored ladies.
---
## MAYME:
Of course.
---
## ESTHER:
The smart set. 
---
Someplace east of Amsterdam, 
---
fancy,
---
where you get pampered and treated real nice. 
---
'Cause no one does
it for us. 
---
We just as soon wash our heads in a bucket 
---
and be treated like mules. 
---
But what I'm talking about is someplace elegant.
---
## MAYME:
Oooo, missie, you too fancy for me.
---
## ESTHER:
And when you come in Miss Mayme, 
---
I'll take your coat and
ask, 
---
"Would you like a cup of tea?"
---
## MAYME:
Why, thank you.
---
## ESTHER:
And I'll open a book of illustrations, 
---
and show you the latest styles.
---
## MAYME:
Ooo, I can pick anything in the book?
---
## ESTHER:
Yes.
---
## MAYME:
How about if I let you choose?
---
## ESTHER:
Very well. 
---
Make yourself comfortable, 
---
put your feet up,
---
I know they tired.
---
## MAYME:
Shucks honey, 
---
you don't know the half.
---
## ESTHER:
And in no time flat 
---
for the cost a ride uptown and back,
---
you got a whole new look.
---
## MAYME:
Just like that? 
---
I reckon I'd pay someone good money 
---
to be treated like a lady. 
---
It would be worth two, 
---
three days on my back. 
---
Yes, it would.
---
## ESTHER:
You think so?
---
## MAYME:
I know so.
---
## ESTHER:
And if I told you 
---
I got a little, something saved? 
---
I keep it sewed up in the lining of a crazy quilt.
---
## MAYME:
On a cold lonely night
---
wouldn't that quilt be a poor
woman's dream.
---
## ESTHER:
I been saving it slowly 
---
since I come North. 
---
It for that beauty parlor. 
---
I ain't told nobody that. 
---
Honest, for true.
---
## MAYME:
Where'd you get such a damn serious face?
---
## ESTHER:
Why not?
---
## MAYME:
Because, we just fooling that's all. 
---
I ain't been to Prague, 
---
ain't never going to Prague.
---
## ESTHER:
But come, 
---
is this what you want to be doing 
---
ten years from now, twenty?
---
## MAYME:
You think I ain't tried to make a go of it. 
---
You think I just
laid down 
---
and opened my legs 
---
'cause it was easy. 
---
This place may not look like nothing, 
---
but this saloon is better 
---
then a lot of them places, 
---
ask anybody. 
---
Oh, just last night one of Bert Williams' musicians 
---
sat up front, 
---
and he stayed through the entire show. 
---
You think some of
those gals in the big revues 
---
didn't start right where I am.
---
## ESTHER:
You got this beautiful piano 
---
that you play better than
anyone I know. 
---
There are a dozen church choirs that you could play
---
## MAYME:
Let me tell you, 
---
so many wonderful ideas been conjured in this room. 
---
And they get left in that bed, 
---
or on this piano bench. 
---
They are scattered all over this room. 
---
Esther. 
---
I ain't waiting on anybody to rescue me. 
---
My Panama man done come and gone
long time now. 
---
It sweet that he write you but,
---
my dear, it ain't real.
---
## ESTHER:
Yes, 
---
he here in my pocket in a cambric walking suit, 
---
and he has a heliotrope handkerchief 
---
stuffed in his pocket 
---
and a sweet way about him. 
---
He so far away, 
---
I can carry him in my pocket like a
feather. 
---
## MAYME:
You funny. 
---
You and your silly letter.
---
## ESTHER:
Ain't a week go by without one. 
---
It got so I know the postman by name. 
---
## MAYME:
Well, I ain't interested. 
---
So put it away.
---
## ESTHER:
Cmon Miss Mayme don't be proud, 
---
you know you want to read it. 
---
---
## MAYME:
Oh Hell, give it here. 
---
Ooo.
---
## ESTHER:
What it say?
---
## MAYME:
Look like your man got himself a new pair of socks. 
---
Wait a minute, he askin' what you look like. 
---
Ain't you told him?
---
## ESTHER:
No, I was afraid, 
---
I ain't known what to say.
---
## MAYME:
You tell him the truth.
---
## ESTHER:
That I don't look like much.
---
## MAYME:
You tell him that you're about as lovely a person as there is.
---
## ESTHER:
That ain't so.
---
## MAYME:
Of course, it is. 
---
And you think half the men that come in here 
---
bother looking at my face. 
---
He don't care about this.
---
He interested in this. 
---
This is what he's asking about. [laughs]
---
## ESTHER:
I wouldn't dare write about something like that. 
---
He Christian!
---
## MAYME:
And it's in his weakness 
---
that he'll find his strength.
---
Hallelujah! 
---
## MAYME:

## ESTHER:
I'm being serious and you got your mind in the gutter.
---
## MAYME:
Oh come on Esther, 
---
the man just asking what you look
like 
---
'cause he want something pretty 
---
to think about come sundown.
---
## ESTHER:
You reckon? 
---
Will you help me write something?
---
## MAYME:
No, what about your white lady? 
---
Why not have her do it? 
---
## ESTHER:
'Cause I'm asking you, my friend.
---
## MAYME:
No, my writing ain't perfect.
---
## ESTHER:
Don't bother about the handwriting,
---
we'll tell him I pricked my finger while sewing. 
---
He'll understand. 
---
Please.
---
## MAYME:
Oh.  
---
I ain't romantic, 
---
I find this silly, really I do. 
---
But only 'cause it's you. 
---
So, where should we begin?
---
## ESTHER:
"Dear George." 
---
## MAYME: 
A love letter to a gentleman. 
---
Oooo, I know.

"Dear George, I write you wearing a lavender silk robe with — "

---
## GEORGE:
Dear Esther,
---
Thank you for your sweet words. 
---
Your pricked finger 
---
delivered the most unexpected lift. 
---
It quiet now. 
---
The only motion is the rain.
---
The only sound is the rain. 
---
It is the white season, 
---
and the work all but stop. 
---
The rum shop be the onliest business that do prosper. 
---
I seen months of hard work lost in an evening 
---
and good men befriend the devil overnight. 
---
And if I told you it's been months 
---
since I've seen a decent a woman 
---
it wouldn't be a lie. 
---
There are caravans of sweet-faced Indian girls 
---
offering up their childhood 
---
for a half-day's wage. 
---
Yes, many men leave here with less than they come. 
---
I shan't be one. 
---
It isn't appropriate, 
---
but I will say it. 
---
I crave a gentlewoman's touch, 
---
even if only be to turn down my collar 
---
or brush away the dirt in the evenings. 
---
I'd like to meet you as a gentleman. 
---
I think much about the suit I will wear, 
---
and the colors that your eyes
find pleasing. 
---
I imagine your cobblestone roads 
---
and the splendid carriages 
---
on the avenues, 
---
and a dry place to sit. 
---
I think of you 
---
running silk thread between your fingers 
---
and find a bit of holy relief, 
---
for your letters arrive just in time 
---
to ward off temptation.
---
Yours Affectionately,
---
George

I'm sorry,

That's all.

I know these kind of men.

Sugared words, 
---
but let them stick to the page 
---
and go no further. 
---
He'll steal your common sense, 
---
he will 
---
and walk away. 
---
It just don't seem like you, Esther, 
---
you're too practical a girl for this.
---
## ESTHER:
Don't set your clock by my habits.
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
His tone is very familiar. 
---
And I don't approve.
---
## ESTHER:
I'm sorry, 
---
I needn't your approval.
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
My goodness. 
---
I hope you don't expect
---
nothing to come of this. 
---
## ESTHER:
And if I do?
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
Mr. Charles 
---
Mr. Charles has asked me twice about you this week. 
---
I told him he was most welcome to call.
---
## ESTHER:
Mr. Charles is a fool 
---
and a glutton. 
---
And I'm sure he don't 
even know who I am.
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
You a stubborn young country girl. 
---
And very particular. 
---
And it wouldn't hurt you to be more receptive.
---
## ESTHER:
To who? 
---
Mr. Charles? 
---
Remember it's me you're talking
to, 
---
not Doreen or Erma, 
---
or one of those other silly 
---
open-hearted little gals. 
---
And yes, 
---
I'm writing letters to a man. 
---
And it may come to nothing. 
---
But I am his sweetheart twice a month, 
---
and I can fill that envelope 
---
with anything that I want.
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
It's an innocent enough flirtation, 
---
and I had my share in my youth. 
---
And believe me when I say 
---
that I was romanced 
---
by many bright and willing young man. 
---
It's potent, I know, 
---
but I ain't ashamed to say
---
and I ain't afraid to say 
---
that it ultimately led 
---
to compromise. 
---
And if you're not careful, then Esther 
---
## ESTHER:
DON'T! 
---
This quilt is filled with my hard work, 
---
one hundred dollars for every year 
---
I been seated at that sewing machine.
---
It's my beauty parlor. 
---
So you see I don't need Mr. Charles 
---
for his good job and position. 
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
You think this is enough? 
---
Do you? 
---
You think you're gonna be happy 
---
when another half dozen girls 
---
waltz away in camisoles of your making. 
---
When the Bellman's Ball 
---
comes around another year 
---
and you here fluffing ruffles 
---
for some girl from Kentucky, 
---
who just happy to be wearing shoes.
---
## ESTHER:
No, I don't think that. 
---
And would give this quilt 
---
and every-thing in it 
---
to be with someone I care for, 
---
I would.
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
This man in Panama,

Dear Esther,

I opened the letter

tumbled out onto the ground.

Imagine my surprise,

gray wool, pink silk and the blue flannel, 
---
I tucked in the back of my shirt this morning.

It is hand-dyed silk, I washed it yesterday and look.

Beautiful.

Have you ever seen anything like that?

Never.

It will feel even better against your back.

Don't worry.

It is fine.

It'll take me no time.

Thank you.

Truly.

It is fine.

Why do you always wear black? 
---
You sell these magnificent colors, 
---
and yet every time I see you, 
---
you're wearing black.
---
## MARKS:
You ask a very complicated question. 
---
Its an act of faith,
---
that is the simplest way I know how to explain. 
---
It is one of the many ways 
---
I show my devotion to God. 
---
## ESTHER:
Is marrying someone you don't know another?
---
## MARKS:
It is a thousand years of history 
and struggle 
---
behind the answer to that question.
---
## ESTHER:
And yet it seems as simple as 
---
taking off a jacket. 
---
I'm sorry, 
---
I didn't mean to upset you.
---
## MARKS:
You haven't upset me.
---
## ESTHER:
If you wrap the magenta, 
---
I'll pay you next week.
---
## MARKS:
To answer your question, 
---
it has always been that way 
---
in my family.
---
## ESTHER:
But this a new country.
---
## MARKS:
But we come with our pockets stuffed, yes. 
---
We don't throw away nothing 
---
for fear we might need it later 
---
I wear my father's suit. 
---
It is old, I know, 
---
but this simple black fabric is my
most favorite. 
---
Why? 
---

with a relationship to my ancestors

and God.

## MRS. VAN BUREN:
Hand-dyed silk? 
---
Is it popular?
---
## ESTHER:
It will be by fall.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
Really? 
---
I have to weave that tidbit 
---
into conversation this evening.
---
My in-laws are coming. 
---
The frog and the wart. 
---
Oh, and did I tell you? 
---
I got to see Mr. Max Fiedler of Germany
---
conduct selections from Don Juan. 
---
I had to 'endure an encore from
the soprano, 
---
what was her name? 
---
Something Russian, no doubt. 
---
I'd rather have gone to the electric show 
---
at Madison Square Garden,
---
but you see Harry isn't impressed with electricity 
---
"Miracle upon miracle, 
---
but there remain things science 
---
will never be able to give
us," he says, 
---
so he refrains from enthusiasm. 
---
By the way, 
---
I bled this morning, 
---
and when I delivered the news to Harry 
---
he spat at me. 
---
This civilized creature of society. 
---
We all bleed, Esther. 
---
And yet I felt
---
as though I was a young girl again 
---
apologizing for becoming a woman.  
---
Maybe I'll be a bohemian,
---
a bohemian needn't a husband, 
---
she's not bound by convention.'
---
## ESTHER:
I don't see why 
---
you let him do you this way, missus. 
---
If you don't mind me saying. 
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
Have you been to the opera? 
---
## ESTHER:
Never.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
Oh God, you're lucky. 
---
It's one of those things that's required of me. 
---
I'm sure you've found a more 
---
engaging means of entertainment.
---
## ESTHER:
I actually only been to the theatre once.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
Really? 
---
What did you see?
---
## ESTHER:
Nothing special. 
---
A blind gal from Alabama sang spirituals.
---
I need you to lift your arms.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
Like this? 
---
It's pinching me right here. 
---
---
I've never been to a colored show before, 
---
I'm told they're quite good.
---
## ESTHER:
I suppose.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
I should like to see one for myself. 
---
You must take me to one of your shows.
---
## ESTHER:
And will you take me to the opera 
---
next time you go?
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
I would, if I could. 
---
It would be marvelously
scandalous, 
---
just the sort of thing to perk up this humdrum season: 
---
It is so easy to be with you.
---
Your visits are just about the only 
---
thing I look forward to these days. 
---
You, and our letters to George, 
---
of course. 
---
Shall we write something dazzling to him this time? 
---
Something delicious. 
---
## ESTHER:
But, if we
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
What? 
---
Why not?
---
## ESTHER:
Perhaps something simple this time, 
---
I believe there real affection growing.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
Yes, one would hope. 
---
He seems quite taken.
---
## ESTHER:
I don't want him to be disappointed.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
And he needn't be. 
---
We will send him your warmth 
---
and he will find you irresistible.
---
## ESTHER:
Do you think we could describe this silk?
---
Will you tell him what it feel like against your skin? 
---
How it soft and supple to the touch. 
---
I ain't got the words, 
---
but I want him to know this color,
---
magenta red. 
---
What it make you feel right now. 
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
The silk? 
---
Are you sure?
---
## ESTHER:
Yes.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
Mercy, 
---
if my friends knew 
---
that I spend my afternoons writing love letters 
---
to a colored laborer, 
---
they'd laugh me out of
Manhattan.
---
## ESTHER:
People do a lot of things 
---
that they don't ever speak of.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
I smoked opium once, 
---
with the most proper of women. 
---
She dared me and I did it. 
---
And you? 
---
What have you done? 
---
## ESTHER:
I touched someone 
---
who I knew I wasn't supposed to touch. 
---
I touched them because I wanted to, 
---
it was wrong, 
---
but I couldn't help myself.

## GEORGE:
Dearest Esther,
---
It dawn. 
---
No work has begun, 
---
the morning is still holding the
ocean, 
---
not yet blue. 
---
But I can see past everything 
---
green to the horizon. 
---
And it is here in half-light 
---
that I imagine you. 
---
Six months have passed 
---
since our first correspondence, 
---
and much has changed.
---
A water boy from my parish died, 
---
taken by fever two nights past.
---
All their magic machinery 
---
and there's nothing could be done 
---
for this boy. 
---
It got me thinking about his family 
behind 
---
and the wife he'd never meet. 
---
He die so easy. 
---
Why he? 
---
His young life end, 
---
and not more than a word 
---
from the Yankee chief, 
---
'cept regret that the new boy ain't so quick. 
---
This morn I try to remember 
---
his small blackened face 
---
and cannot even recall his smile, 
---
though his hand give me water 
---
each and every day since I be here. 
---
Why this boy go out my mind, I ask? 
---
Tomorrow I too could be sucked into the ground 
---
without tears and ride the death train 
---
that pass through here five times a day. 
---
When I first come, 
---
a solid ox was the dream of this man. 
---
But I watch the splendid way 
---
the American gentlemen touch their fine machines 
---
and laugh away the jungle, and I know
---
what great and terrible things their sleep brings. 
---
And yet, your America sounds like a wondrous place, 
---
a man such as myself would be 
---
willing to surrender much for a 
---
taste of the modern world. 
---
Yes, I see beyond the tilting palms, 
---
through the mangroves 
---
and across the Caribbean sea 
---
to where you sit. 
---
I kneel beside you at this moment
and I tell you, 
---
I am a good strong man. 
---
What I've come to feel for you 
---
can best be described as love. 
---
I love you. 
---
There is no other way to say it, 
---
will you marry me?
---
Most Adoringly,
---
George

Why ya smiling so big?

Close your mouth

He's asked me to marry him.

## MAYME:

## MAYME:

Our own Miss Esther.
---
## ESTHER:
He say he loves me.
---
## MAYME:
And do you love him?
---
## ESTHER:
As much as you can 
---
love a man you ain't seen. 
---
I'm thirty-five, 
---
Mayme, and he wants to many me. 
---
And there ain't gonna be 
---
no more opportunities 
---
I'm afraid. 
---
I've told him yes.
---
## MAYME:
Well, goddamn. 
---
I'm sure he's a fine man.
---
## ESTHER:
Yes, I suppose. 
---
Any man go through this much 
---
trouble to court a woman 
---
must have his virtues.
---
## MAYME:
I reckon.
---
## ESTHER:
He write that he arriving next month.
---
## MAYME:
So soon, you hardly ready.
---
## ESTHER:
I know. 
---
I'm getting married! 
---
Oh God, will you come 
and witness the ceremony?
---
## MAYME:
Me? 
---
You want to bring me 
---
around your new husband?
---
## ESTHER:
It would be nice to have a friend witness.
---
## MAYME:
No, I ain't been to church 
---
since I was seventeen. 
---
It ain't about you, 
---
it's just a promise I made to myself sometime ago. 
---
I ain't got nothing to say to God, 
---
and I don't think it's right 
---
to go up into some-body's home 
---
and you ain't on speaking terms.
---
## ESTHER:
It just a building.
---
## MAYME:
Just the same, 
---
I'd rather not be reminded. 
---
But thank you, 
---
it's a long time since I been 
---
invited anyplace proper.
---
## ESTHER:
Me too. 
---
## MAYME:
Hell, we ought to celebrate. 
---
Somebody give me this gin.
---
It look expensive. 
---
Whatcha think? 
---
Should I open it?
---
## ESTHER:
Sure. Why not. 
---
## MAYME:
We gonna toast 
---
to one less spinster in New York.
---
## ESTHER:
Oh God, 
---
I hope I ain't making a mistake.
---
## MAYME:
Oh, You'll be fine. 
---
You're about the most sensible 
---
gal I know.

Enjoy this feeling, honey.

It's a splendid,
Yes, indeed.

## MRS. DICKSON:
Oh, Who is going to sit next to me 
at the table?
---
Well, there is Bertha, 
---
but she has no conversation. 
---
Oh, I could move Erma down close,  
---
but she and Bertha don't speak. 
---
It's gonna be a mess at that dinner table
---
That's for sure.
---
## ESTHER:
You wasn't always pleased 
---
with my conversation if I recall.
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
Who said that? 
---
Well, they lie.  
---
Oh no. 
---
What?
---
Really Esther?
---
My grandmother wouldn't even wear 
---
a collar like this
---
and she's a right proud Christian soldier. 
---
Yes.
---
## ESTHER:
Well, I like it. 
---
It's the most refined thing I own. 
---
I paid five whole dollars for it.
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
You gonna scare your gentleman, 
---
and it ain't worth five dollars of misery. 
---
You needn't be so prude. 
---
Your man'll have needs, 
---
and it'll be your duty to keep his 
---
member firmly at home. 
---
Yes.
---
## ESTHER:
Excuse me?
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
I shan't repeat it. 
---
You see, the thing is, is that sometimes he need pleasure in order for you to ensure your satisfaction.
---
Esther, sometimes a man needs a little help. Now it's a shame and a disappointment to have a husband with very little vigor. Yes.
---
You know, the way I see it. Now, I'm not an expert but the best of friends come together and they uh match it up well, but now listen, you can understand that um sometimes, you need to just understand that a man will test you and he'll try you, but don't let him beat on you.  Don't take no shit off of him, understand?

But there ain't no greater
disappointment 
---
than a husband without much vigor. 
---
Believe me, I know. 
---
And sometime he gotta be pleasured to ensure your
---
own satisfaction. 
---
You understand. 
---
I ain't an expert, 
---
but I do have some experience. 
---
And I'll tell you, 
---
give and take make for the best
of partnerships. 
---
Never mind what the minister tells you about decency, 
---
what go on between a man and wife 
---
be their own business.
---
He will test you 
---
and he will try you, 
---
but don't let him beat on you,
---
don't take no shit from him, 
---
understand.
---
## ESTHER:
Mrs. Dickson.
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
Excuse me for saying, 
---
but if he raises his hand
once, 
---
he'll do it again. 
---
Now, I thought we should have this conversation 
---
but you come as an innocent 
---
and I'm a friend
---
I just wanted to talk to you plainly.
---
## ESTHER:
Well,Thank you, 
---
but I do believe I'm old enough 
---
to handle things myself.
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
Yeah, well, 
---
I just thought it should be said. 
---
Now whatcha want me to do with this dress?
---
## ESTHER:
It that bad?
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
Let's just say 
---
we'll give it to Deacon Wynn 
---
to let the church ladies fight over it. 
---
Yes. 
---
You really going to do this, 
---
aren't you?
---
## ESTHER:
You didn't expect me to be here for the rest of my life?
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
I sort of did. 
---
I got used to your sewing machine 
---
and your foot tapping round here.
---
## ESTHER:
Another gal will move into this room, 
---
and by supper you'll be fussing about something new.
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
Well, you say that with much certainty. 
---
You hurt my feelings, Miss Esther Mills. 
---
Eighteen years is a long time. 
---
I don't reckon I've known anybody else quite that long. 
---
It'll be lonesome.
---
## ESTHER:
You have plenty of suitors to keep you busy.
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
But not a working one of them.
---
---
You sure you want to do this.
---
## ESTHER:
Yes, I am. 
---
I stay on here, 
---
I'll turn into dust one day, 
---
get swept up and released 
---
into the garden without notice. 
---
I've finally found someone. 
---
Just as you found Mr. Dickson.
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
I married him, 
---
because I was thirty-seven years
old, 
---
no profession and there wasn't a 
---
decent colored man in New York City 
that would have me.
---
## ESTHER:
But you come to love each other.
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
I suppose. 
---
He give me some laughs. 
---
But you see, 
---
my mother wanted me to marry up. 
---
She was a washerwoman,
---
and my father was the very married minister of our mission. 
---
He couldn't even look into the church pews and see her, 
---
but she'd sit
there proudly 
---
every Sunday, hoping to gain God's favor. 
---
Marry
good. 
---
She didn't want me to be embarrassed of my fingers 
---
the way she was of hers. 
---
I'd watch her put witch hazel and hot oil on her delicate hands, 
---
but they remained raw and chapped 
---
and she put her hands and hide them in gray gloves.
---
In the winter they'd
bleed so bad sometimes, 
---
but she'd plunge her hands 
---
into the hot water 
---
without flinching, 
---
knead and scrub the clothing clean. 
---
Fold and press for hours and hours, 
---
the linen, the bedding, 
---
the stockings
---
and the britches, 
---
sometimes wearing the frayed gloves 
---
so as not to leave bloodstains 
---
on her precious laundry. 
---
She wouldn't even let me
help her, 
---
she didn't want my hands to show 
---
the markings of labor.
---
I was going to marry up. 
---
Love was an entirely impractical thing 
---
for a woman in her position. 
---
"Look what love done to me," Mama used to say. 
---
"Look what love done to me." 
---
So I did what was necessary to gain favor. 
---
I allowed myself to be flattered by gentlemen.
---
You understand? 
---
Yes, 
---
this "pretty" gal done things, un-pretty things,
---
for this marble mantle, 
---
gaslights in every room, 
---
a player piano 
---
and an indoor toilet.
---
## ESTHER:
But Mr. Dickson was a good man.
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
Bless his broken-down soul. 
---
He had fine suits and perfect diction, 
---
and was too high on opium to notice that he was married. 
---
But I would not be a washerwoman if it killed me.
---
And I have absolutely marvelous hands to prove it. 
---
But you have godly fingers and a
means, 
---
and you deserve a gentleman. 
---
Why gamble it all away for a
common laborer?
---
## ESTHER:
Love.
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
Don't you let a man 
---
have no part of your heart 
---
without getting a piece of his. 
---
## GEORGE:
Dear Esther, 
---
I held in the port of Havana, Cuba,
---
awaiting passage to New York City. 
---
A passenger come down with
cholera. 
---
So here I wait, 
---
fighting patience. 
---
We sail tomorrow

## MARKS:
Miss Mills, 
---
where have you been? 
---
I thought I'd lost you
to a competitor. 
---
I keep looking out the window 
---
at Mr. Friedlander's shop, 
---
he's giving away thread with each purchase.
---
Yesterday, stress tonic. 
---
Tomorrow, who knows? 
---
I saw this morning
Mrs. Simons, 
---
Mrs. Simons my cousin's wife, 
---
go into Mr. Friedlander's.
---
His fabric is inferior, 
---
I tell her this. 
---
But she wants the stress tonic
---
then go to the pharmacy I say. 
---
Where have you been? 
---
I've been going crazy. 
---
I couldn't bear to lose you to Friedlander.
---
## ESTHER:
I'm sorry, I 
---
## MARKS:
No, I'm sorry. 

You've been busy, of course. 

I thought something might have 
happened to you.
---
## ESTHER:
Don't tell me you were worried about me.
---
## MARKS:
Well, yes. 
---
I didn't have your address, 
---
otherwise I would have inquired 
---
about your health.

## ESTHER:
I'm very well,

thank you.
---
## MARKS:
I found something I think you'll love.  
---
Do you have a moment?
---
## ESTHER:
Yes.
---
## MARKS:
You get it.  
---
I just made tea, 
---
would you have a cup of tea with me?
---
## ESTHER:
Thank you, that would be nice.

## MARKS:
Is the tea hot enough? 

Milk? 

Would you like sugar, of
course?
---
## ESTHER:
No, thank you, it's fine. 
---
## MARKS:
You have a lovely smile.  
---
Let me show you the fabric.
---
## ESTHER:
Actually, I have a special request. 
---
I'll need fabric for a
wedding gown, 
---
something simple, Mr. Marks. 
---
The bride don't got a lot of money 
---
to throw away.
---
## MARKS:
Satin? Chiffon? Cotton? Silk? 
---
Yes. Tulle?
---
## ESTHER:
Satin, I think.

## MARKS:
She hasn't told you?

## ESTHER:
Silk.

## MARKS:
That one you're touching is very popular.

And the price
will please you. 
---
Thirty cents a yard.

## ESTHER:
Twenty?
---
## MARKS:
Twenty-five cents. 
---
The bride will like.
---
## ESTHER:
It's too much. 
---
Something less expensive, 
---
dress it up with lace and ribbons. 
---
How about this one?
---
## MARKS:
It's a wedding. 
---
This is for an older woman ---

## ESTHER:
I ain't so young.

## MARKS:
the bride's mother perhaps.

You are gettingmarried?
---
## ESTHER:
Yes. 
---
You seem surprised.
---
## MARKS:
No, no. Not at all. 
---
My congratulations.  
---
Please. 
---
I'm sure the rich lady who ordered this 
---
didn't appreciate the delicacy of the fabric.
---
She gave no thought to who crafted this perfection, 
---
the labor that went into making it. 
---
How many hands touched it. 
---
Look. 
---
Beautiful.
---
You deserve to wear it on your wedding day.
---
## ESTHER:
Its so beautiful, 

it looks like little fairy hands made it.

It's too fine for me.
---
## MARKS:
Come, touch it and then refuse. 
---
Please. Touch.  
---
It is exquisite.

Miss Mills, many fine ladies 
---
have worn it against their skin,

but it was made for you.

I know this.

May it be your first
gift.

I won't let you.

ACT TWO
Scene 1
The Wedding Corset —White Satin
Embroidered with Orange Blossoms
Esther stands in a pool of light, she wears a spectacular white
wedding gown. Another pool elk& engsgfi George, he wears
a worn gray dress suit frayed around the sleeves, certainly his
best. Lights the. A spare studio fiat, an iron bed dominates the
room. George and Esther stand on either side of the bah
which is covered with the crazy quilt A silence divides them.
Finally Esther speaks.
---
## ESTHER:
Don't really feel much different. I guess I expected
somethin' to be different. It was a nice ceremony. Didn't you think?
I wish my family coulda witnessed it all. My mother in particular.
When the minister said man and wife I nearly fainted, I did. I been
waiting to hear those words, since they nearly took my breath
away. Man and wife, and the truth is we barely know each other.
I've written you near everything there is to know about me, and
here we is and I fear I ain't got no more to say. (Note: George's accent
is a touch heavier and snore distinctly Barbadian than in the first act.)
---
## GEORGE:
We ain't need to say nothin' now. We got plenty of
rime for that. It late. (George takes off his jacket and tosses it across the
bed. He loosens his top button. Esther picks up thejacket, quickly surveys
the label, then neatly folds it, placing it at the bottom oft& bed.)
---
## ESTHER:
Do you wish to bathe? I'll fetch the basin. (George kneels
on the bed and extends his hand to Esther.)
---
## GEORGE:
Why don't yuh come sit by me. Let me see yuh. (Esther
sinks on the bed with her back to George. He gently strokes her cheek.
Esther trembles.) Are yuh afraid of me? Yuh shaking.
---
## ESTHER:
Am I? None of this be familiar.
---
## GEORGE:
Give yuh hand 'erc. (Esther gingerly passes her hand to
George. He sits next to ben kissing each of her fingers, then places her hand
37
on his crotch.) See. It ain't scary at all. (Esther leaves her band resting on
his crotch, anconOrtable. A moment.) I expected yuh to be —
---
## ESTHER:
Prettier.
---
## GEORGE:
No, I was gonna say —
---
## ESTHER:
It's okay, I lived with this face all my life, ain't no surprises.
We should say what we think now and get it out of the way.
---
## GEORGE:
I suppose from yuh letters —
---
## ESTHER:
I described my character. And I think you'll find me
truthful. (George begins to unbutton Esther's dress. She stiffens at his
touch.) Yo u ' r e very handsome. More than I thought and I must say
it do make me a little uncomfortable. (Esther withdraws her hand
from his crotch.) And the other thing I think you must know, I ain't
been with a man before. I been kissed and done some kissing, but
you know what I'm saying. And it might be awkward on this first
night, even if we man and wife —
---
## GEORGE:
Then we'll make it less awkward. (George slips Esther's
thrss shoultlen and plants a kiss on her bare back. She's wearing
a stunning wedding corset of white satin embroidered with orange
blossoms.) Real nice, Pretty. I like it. (He runs his fingers across the
delicate lace covering her breasts.)
---
## ESTHER:
Wait. I made something for you. (Esther stands up and
quickly fetches the smoking jacket.) Here.
---
## GEORGE:
What it?
---
## ESTHER:
It's Japanese silk. Put it on. (George clumsily pulls the
smoking jacket around his muscular body. He clearly isn't comfortable
with the delicacy of the garment.) Careful. (Gene explores the jacket
with his weather-wom fingers.) It ain't too small?
---
## GEORGE:
Nab.. But I afraid, I soil it. (George ?moves the jacket
and tosses it on the bed. He pulls Esther into his arms.)
---
## ESTHER:
Not yet.
---
## GEORGE:
Yuh got somethin' in mind?
---
## ESTHER:
Couldn't we wait a bit?
---
## GEORGE:
Minister say man and wife.
---
## ESTHER:
Please, I'd like to know about your mother or about
your birthplace, Bar-ba-dos. Somethingl don'r know. 'That wasn't
in the letters. Something for us, right now. (A moment.)
---
## GEORGE:
Like what? (Esther pulls away and picks up the smoking
jacket.)
---
## ESTHER:
I come here from North Carolina at seventeen after my
mother died of influenza, God bless her loving spirit. My father
38
died two years later, he was a slave you see and didn't rnke to life as
a freeman. He'd lost his tongue during a nasty fight over a chicken
when I was a baby, so I never heard him speak, no complaints, no
praise, no gentle words, no goodbye. He was silent. Broken
really. I come to this city by myself, worked my way North little by
little, picking berries in every state until I get here. An old woman
in the rooming house reach me to sew intimate apparel, saying
folks'll pay you good money for your discretion. It was just about
the best gift anybody give me. It was as though God kissed my
hands when I first pulled the fabric through the sewing machine
and held up a finished garment. I discovered all I need in these
fingers. (A moment.) I wanted you to know that about me.
---
## GEORGE:
My parents were chattel born to children of chattel.
(George takes off his shirt.) We cut sugar cane and die and that our
tale for as long as anybody could say. Nothin' worthy of a retelling,
really. I come here so the swry'll be different, that I hopin'. Now if yuh
don' mind, I spent many nights on a hard wood floor, a bed be long
overdue. (Esther gives him her hand) We married. I am' gonna commit
no crime 'ere, a man and wife don't 'ave no quarrel in the bedroom.
(George gently pulls her onto the bed. The lights slowly fade as Esther
succumbs to his embrace. Ragtime piano. Mayme and Mrs. Van Buren
elite?; dressed in their twin corsets. They stand over the wedding bed.)
---
## MAYME:
What is he like? (George climbs out of bed, he stands in a
pool of light and slowly goes through the ritual of dressing. Esther kneels
on her bed wrapped in the crazy quilt.)
---
## ESTHER:
He handsome enough.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
Come, what did he say when he saw you?
(Esther climbs out of bed. As they speak, ifnecessaly, _Mayne and Mrs.
Va n Buren may help Esther dress.)
---
## ESTHER:
He ain't say much of nothing. He just stood there for a
moment regarding me with his eyes. Yellow, cotton and cane eyes.
I didn't have no tongue.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
He must be something of a romantic. He
traveled halfway across the world because of some promise on a paper.
---
## ESTHER:
And he still smell of salt and ground nuts. It make me
sick and it make me excited.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
I was tipsy on my wedding night. I recall
being in love with the notion of love, and everything took on a rosy
glow. Harry was foolish and confident and I was frightened to death.
---
## MAYME:
Is he as we imagined?
39
---
## ESTHER:
Yes, he is sturdy enough and quite a pleasure to behold.
His hands thick, stained dark from work. North Carolina field
hands. But he got a melodious voice, each word a song unto itself.
(Mayne and Airs. Van Buren reluctantly retreat into the darkness.
Ertber and George button their shirts.)And when he finally fell asleep
I placed my head on his chest, and listened for the song of cicadas
at dusk, and imagined the sweet aroma of the mango trees and the
giant flamboyant with its crimson tears. (Esther and George stand On
either side of the bed, dressed.)

Valenciennes Lace
GeorgelEsther's boudoir. A rag plays. George smoothes down
his overgrown hain pleased with himseq.. His clothing is worn
but that doesn't seem to trouble him. Esther takes in George
from the corner °Per tye, quickly averting her gaze when be
glances over. He smiles to himself
---
## ESTHER:
Do you want me to fix you something?
---
## GEORGE:
I ain't really hungry, you know.
---
## ESTHER:
Where are you going? It Sunday. I promised Mrs.
Dickson we'd dine with her this afternoon after the church social,
---
## GEORGE:
That woman ask too many questions for me liking.
---
## ESTHER:
That's what ladies do. She's just being attentive. (George
grabs his hat and toys with it for a moment. He ventures to speak, but
stops himself
---
## GEORGE:
Say Mrs. Armstrong, you got two dollars?
---
## ESTHER:
What for?
---
## GEORGE:
I need a proper hat if yuh want me to took for real
work. It near three months now, and this a farmer's hat I tot', The
rag man wouldn' even give me a penny for it.
---
## ESTHER:
Two dollars. That's a lot of money. I tor you I'd make
you a worsted suit. Right smart. (Gaye gently tolithes Esther 's hand)
---
## GEORGE:
Clmon, Mrs. Armstrong. Just two dollars.
40
---
## ESTHER:
But this is the last time. Hear? (Esther, reluctant, goes
over to the quilt and opens the seam with her scissors. She digs in and
pulls out two dollars.) There.
---
## GEORGE:
That all you got?
---
## ESTHER:
Yes. Why do you need to go out?
---
## GEORGE:
I tell some fellas I stop off for a quick ale, be back 'fore
yuh know.
---
## ESTHER:
But it Sunday. I'll put on some tea, and sit, let me mend
your shirt. You can't go out with a hole in your shirt. (Esther touches
the hole in his shirt.) What will they say about your wife? I won't hear
the end of it from Mrs. Dickson.
---
## GEORGE:
She a real madam. "Yuh working, George?" "Oh,
null?" (Chupses.) I air? been this idle since a boy in St. Lucy. But
that busylickum air? 'ear nothing. (Chupses again.) I got me pats on
the back from white engineers, and a letter of recommendation
from the Yankee crew chief heselE But 'ere, I got to watch buildings
going up left and right, steel girders as thick as tamarind trees, ten,
twelve stories high. Thursday last I stood all day, it cold too, waidn'
for the chief, waiting to interview. Do yuh have tools, boy? Yes! Do
yuh know how to operate a machine, boy? Yes. But 'e point just so
to the Irishman, the German, and the tall Norwegian who's at least
fifty years plus five. And I got more experience than the lot. I tell 'e
so. Next time, 'e say. Next time, George. Can you believe? And
when everyone gone, 'e pass me this damn note like it money.
(Gewge takes a leiterfrom his pocket and u;?folds it) Look. (He hands
the note to Esther. She examines it, pretending to read.) What do you
t'ink? (George watches her ever so•cartfidly • )
---
## ESTHER:
I don't know what to say. I suppose he mean what he
say. (She anxiously places the letter on the bed.)
---
## GEORGE:
But what do you t'ink? You t'ink what he say true?
---
## ESTHER:
Why wouldn't he be truthful? (Frustrated, George takes off
his shirt and tosses it to Esther. He then throws hintselfacToss the bed and
lights a cigarette. Esther goes about mending Geotge's shirt by hand) Did
you try oVer at that butcher's? Like I asked. I know they could use p
extra man 'cause it's always crowded in there. Especially on Friday.
---
## GEORGE:
I don' know. We'll see.
---
## ESTHER:
There are worse things you could do. And I thought
maybe we could go to the church social before Mrs. Dickson's.
---
## GEORGE:
I am' a church man, really. (Esther stops sewing.)
---
## ESTHER:
You do believe, don't you? Why in letters you said —
41
---
## GEORGE:
I say a lot of eings. (A moment. Esther returns to sewing.
George fiels the quilt.)
---
## ESTHER:
Please, I ain't been to a social. I sat up in Saint Martin's
for years, and didn't none of them church ladies bother with me
until 1 walked in on your arm, and suddenly they want Mrs.
Armstrong over for tea.
---
## GEORGE:
Yuh and yuh monkey chaser yuh mean?
---
## ESTHER:
Oh that ain't so. Most of them folks ain't been nowhere
to speak of. But they are fine people, and who knows where help
will come from?
---
## GEORGE:
I want to build eings, not polish silver or port luggage.
Them fine jobs for yuh Yankee gentlemen, but not me. I am' come
'ere for thad They'll have me a bootblack 'fore long, ler the damn
Italians blacken their hands, I say. Mine been black long enough. A
man at the saloon, smart looking fella, say the onliest way for a
colored man in this country is for 'e to be 'e own man. Have 'e own
business, otherwise 'e always be shining the white man nickel. You
understand, no? And really, how it look to people. Me, sitting 'ere,
waitin' on fortune, you out there courtin' it.
---
## ESTHER:
I am your wife, and whatever I got, yours. And George
mind your smoking on the bed. The Chinaman two floors down
bum up that way. (George puts out the cigarette.)
---
## GEORGE:
Listen, this fella at the saloon talk about a man sellin'
a stable with a dozen strong draft horses. 'E in a bit of debt, and
need money quick quick. A dozen horses for nothire. Did you 'ear
what I say?
---
## ESTHER:
That saloon talk. That man'll take your money to
Shanghai. It just a dream, it ain't gonna Feed you today.
---
## GEORGE:
You tlink I stupid?
---
## ESTHER:
No. But supposin' he honest, where would you get the
money for twelve horses?
---
## GEORGE:
Where, Mrs. Armstrong? (George gently strokes the
quilt.) Am I wrong?
---
## ESTHER:
My quilt? Never mind with that money. It just there
and it gonna stay there.
---
## GEORGE:
Yuh a squirrel, for true. That's what yuh call them city
rats, no?
---
## ESTHER:
A squirrel ain't a rat. That money for my beauty parlor,
I told you that.
---
## GEORGE:
(Laughs.) That funny.
42
---
## ESTHER:
Why's that funny to you?
---
## GEORGE:
You ownin' a beauty parlor.
---
## ESTHER:
Yes. (George studies Esther. She self-consciously returns
to sewing.)
---
## GEORGE:
Look at yuh. How yuh know pretty from the loolcin'
glass? (A moment.)
---
## ESTHER:
(Wounded) I make pretty things. (George pops up off the
bed and takes Esther in his arms.)
---
## GEORGE:
I sorry, Mrs. Armstrong, 1 am' know what I say. Yuh be
real sweet, if you done up yuh hair, nice. Put a little paint on yuh
lips. (George runs his hand across Esther's mouth. He grabs her and
tries to do a quick dance.)
---
## ESTHER:
I ain't that kind of woman.
---
## GEORGE:
No, yuh am'. (George lets go of Esther's arm. Gently.)
Please, Esther.
---
## ESTHER:
No. That eighteen years there.
---
## GEORGE:
(Chupses.) Yuh vex me so. Where's me shirt?
---
## ESTHER:
It ain't finished. (Gene grabs the shirt from Esther and
puts it on.) Be careful, you'll tear —
---
## GEORGE:
I going o'er to the Empty Cup for an ale. I see yuh later.
---
## ESTHER:
That a notorious place.
---
## GEORGE:
How yuh know?
---
## ESTHER:
I know. (George chupses dismissively.) Why are you so
cross with me? You got your ale money and enough for God knows
what else. Ain't that so?
---
## GEORGE:
Yes, it yuh nickel. How do t'ink that make me feel?
---
## ESTHER:
I come here with nothing.
---
## GEORGE:
Don't look at me so.
---
## ESTHER:
I slept in a cold church for nine days, and picked up
breadcrumbs thrown to pigeons.
---
## GEORGE:
Yes. Yuh done good, but five hundred days digging
don' amount to nothing 'ere. It always gray, why it so gray? Work
on the Isthmus, it hard, but at least the sun shine.
---
## ESTHER:
I know you here 'cause of me, and I want you to be happy.
We stood in that church, and promised before God to cake care of
each other. That means something, even if it gray. You listenin'?
---
## GEORGE:
I listenin'.
---
## ESTHER:
You got a good arm George Armstrong, and I'd be
proud to walk in on it whether it shining shoes or picking cotton.
---
## GEORGE:
I just tired of comin' home to put me hand in yuh pocket.
43
(George grabs his hat and coat. Esther attempts to turn down his collar.
He brushes her hand away.) I off.
---
## ESTHER:
What about Mrs. Dickson and the social?
---
## GEORGE:
I be back for supper. (George grabs his coat and exits.
Esther picks up GeoTe's work letter and crumples it up, Crossfittle to
Mr. Marks' boudoir. Mr. Marks hums a rag as he searches through the
piles offabric. Esther enters.)
---
## MARKS:
Here it is. Scottish wool, it isn't as expensive as one
would think. It is very good.
---
## ESTHER:
Are you humming a rag, Mr. Marks?
---
## MARKS:
No, it's a Romanian song. I can't remember the words. It
is driving me mad.
---
## ESTHER:
(Smiles.) I'm very happy to see that you replaced the
button on your suit.
---
## MARKS:
(Proudly.) Yo u noticed. It was time, don't you think?
(Mr. Marks dhplays the fabric.) Yo u wanted Scottish wool, yes?
---
## ESTHER:
Scottish wool. Yes. (Esther feels the fabric.) It's so heavy.
Would you wear a suit made of this?
---
## MARKS:
Well, yes. You see how soft it is. I bought it from a
gentleman who said it came from his village. He had a wonderful
story about his mother caring for the sheep like small children. He
said every night she'd tell them a fairy tale, and each. morning give the
creatures a kiss and a sprinkle of salt. The neighbors would watch and
laugh. Watch and laugh. But come time to shear the animals, what
wonderful wool they produced for his mother. Like no other. (Esther
_leek the fabric, lovingly Mr. Marks melt in her delight) He could have
been a thief for all I know, but the color is a lovely coffee, very subtle.
Don't you think? So I pay too much, but not enough for the quality.
All! Yes. I have something else to show you. It's here. Where is it?
Where are you? Here we are. (Mr. Marks unfurls a roll of lace) I almost
let it go last week, but I was waiting for you. I wanted you to see it.
---
## ESTHER:
Oh, yes.
---
## MARKS:
I knew you'd like it. (Elated.) The wait was worth seeing
your smile again. (Marks playfiilly drapes the lace around Esther
neck. They find themselves standing dangerously close to each other.
They are so close that they can inhale each other's wordy. A moment.)
Miss Mills, if I may say —
---
## ESTHER:
Armstrong. (Esther removes the lace.)
---
## MARKS:
I apologize. I forget. I forget. (A moment. Mr. Marks takes
the lace and places it on the cutting board.)
44
---
## ESTHER:
It is pretty, thank you, but today I've come for fabric for
a gentleman's suit. Next time.
---
## MARKS:
Yes. Just a minute, I have some other wools, gabardine,
if you'd like to see? I have no story for them, but they are sturdy and
reliable, will give you no problems. (As Mr. Marks turns to search for
another bolt offitbric. Esther gently runs her fingers across the lace. Mr.
Marks turns with the dark drab suit fabrics. Mr. Marks slowly rolls the
lace, his disappointment palpable.) Next time.
---
## ESTHER:
Mr. Marks?
---
## MARKS:
Yes? (Esther wants to say something, but she can't quite find
the words.) Is there — ?
---
## ESTHER:
No. No I'm sorry I can't do this. (Distraught.) I
thought I'd be able to, but I can't. I can't come here anymore. I —
---
## MARKS:
Why do you say this? Did I do something to offend, tell
me, did I —
---
## ESTHER:
No.
---
## MARKS:
Then —
---
## ESTHER:
Please, I think you know why. (A moment.)
---
## MARKS:
How many yards will you need for the gentleman's suit?
---
## ESTHER:
Four yards. The Scottish wool and if you would,
please wrap the Valenciennes lace. (Crossfade to Mrs. Van Buren's
boudoir. Light pours into her room.)
Scene 3
Rose Chemise
Mrs. Van Buren 's boudoin Mrs. Van Buren sits on the bed
cradling a snifter of brandy. She's upbeat, almost cheerfid
Howeven Esther is distracted, consumed by her own thoughts.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
He's gone to Europe.
---
## ESTHER:
I'm sorry to hear that.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
You needn't be. It's a relief actually. Some
business obligation, I don't expect to see him for months. He'll find
ways of prolonging his stay, no doubt. Anyway, I'm considering a
45
visit with friends in Lenox this summer. It'll be good to escape the
city. Don't you think? You could come, of course, I'll recommend
your services to several women.
---
## ESTHER:
I thank you, but I can't. (Esther drapes the Valenciennes
Lace over the bedpost.) Here. I found a strand of lace for your rose
chemise. I know it ain't exactly what you wanted, but —
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
I had all but forgotten. I ordered it over four
weeks ago. Four whole weeks. It's not like you to —
---
## ESTHER:
I been busy.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
Oh? Indeed. How is our Mr. Armstrong?
---
## ESTHER:
Good. Well, he good. Work scarce, and he so par-
ticular. He wanting, but his pride make him idle. And I try, I do,
but he ain't really take to this city.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
But he will. I am certain. Oh Esther, it must
be wonderful to be in love.
---
## ESTHER:
I suppose. (A moment. Mrs. Van Buren quickly examines
the lace, indifferent, she tosses it onto the bed. Esther bristles at her
employer's lack of interest.)
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
Is everything all right? •
---
## ESTHER:
Yes.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
Such a long face so early in the day. I won't
allow it. (Esther doesn't smile.) Come.
---
## ESTHER:
I'd like to settle matters. Please. You ain't paid me in
two months and I need the money.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
Of course, I hadn't realized. (Mrs. Van Buren sits
at her drasing table. Smiling to herself) You !wow whati I miss wridng
our letters. I do! I've been absolutely without purpose for months.
---
## ESTHER:
(Snaps.) Let's not talk about the letters!
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
(Surprised.) Fine, we won't.
---
## ESTHER:
I'm sorry, Mrs. Van Buren.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
Something is wrong.
---
## ESTHER:
No. Nothing. (Esther sits on the edge of Mrs. Van Buren's
bed. She carefully refolds the lace, attempting to bold back tears, but
they come anyway)
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
Esther, what is it?
---
## ESTHER:
The other day George asked me to read a letter. I took it
in my hand and I lied. I lie every day. And I'm a Christian woman.
(Mrs. Van Buren takes Esther's hand and sits down on the bed next to her.)
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
We do what we must, no? We are ridiculous
creatures sometimes. (A moment.)
46
---
## ESTHER:
Do you love Mr. Van Buren?
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
I am a married women, such a question is
romantic.
---
## ESTHER:
But I fear my love belongs someplace else.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
And why is that?
---
## ESTHER:
I shouldn't say. No, I can't. Perhaps I'm wrong.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
Perhaps not. (Mrs. Van Buren pull r Ether
close and plants a kiss on Esther's lips. Either for a moment gives in to
the sensation ofbeing touched, then abruptly pulls away Shocked.) I'm
sorry. I didn't mean to do that. I'm sorry. Please don't go. I just
-wanted to show you what it's like to be treated lovingly.
---
## ESTHER:
Don't say that. You don't love me.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
How do you know? Please. We will forget
this and continue to be friends.
---
## ESTHER:
Friends? How we friends? -When I ain't never been
through your front door. You love me? What of me do you love?
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
Esther, you are the only one who's been in
my boudoir in these months. And honestly, it's only in here with
you, that I fed happy. Please, I want us to be friends?
---
## ESTHER:
I'm sorry. I can't.
---
## MRS. VAN BUREN:
(Screams.) Coward! (A moment.) I'm sorry.
(Mrs. Van Buren digs into her dressing-table drawer and produces
watt of money. She tosses the money on the bed.) There.
---
## ESTHER:
I'm not the coward. (Esther picks up the money Cros9cade
to Mayme's boudoir. Marne plays a slow, seductive rag. George enters,
he watches Maynze gracefislly regard the instrument. He places money
on top oft& piano, then stntddles the piano bench behind Mayne. He
kisses her neck and cups her breasts in his hands. Crossfade to Esther's
boudoir. Esther sits alone, waiting. Crossfizde to Mayme's boudoir.)

Scene 4
Gentleman's Suit
Mayme's boudoir. Esther enters. Mayme is dressed in a red
flowing dressing gown and bubbles over with excitement.
---
## MAYME:
I've saved up every penny I have. It's been two months
and I want something new, Esther. Simple, this time, without all
the pronouncement. Something a young gal might wear on her
wedding night.
---
## ESTHER:
Wedding night? What ain't I heard? I don't believe those
words got any place in your mouth.
---
## MAYME:
Seriously.
---
## ESTHER:
What's going on? C'mon, are you gonna tell me?
---
## MAYME:
It ain't nothing really. A fella, perhaps.
---
## ESTHER:
I thought you didn't feel nothing for these fools.
---
## MAYME:
Nothing ain't never felt so good.
---
## ESTHER:
Who is he?
---
## MAYME:
He ain't nobody really, but he real sweet. Like a schoolboy
almost. We call him Songbird, 'cause he sing to speak. He come in
like all them others. Hands crude and calloused, a week's wage in
his pocket. But when we done I didn't want him to leave and I
asked him to have a drink. Fool drunk up all my liquor, but it ain't
bother me. In Fact I was &in' to run out and git some more, but he
placed his hands around my waist, real gentle and pulled me close.
I actually wanted him to kiss me, I didn't even mind his sour tongue
in my mouth, I wanted him there, inside me. He ain't like a lot of
the colored men who pass through here with anger about their
touch. He a gentleman. Comes three times a week on schedule like
the iceman. He was here last night until midnight, but he don't ever
stay later. He just leaves his scent, which lingers until two A.M. or
three, and I tie awake until it disappears.
---
## ESTHER:
He sounds wonderful.
---
## MAYME:
Yeah, I reckon.
---
## ESTHER:
What?
48
---
## MAYME:
Whatcha think? He got a wife. Yeah. A rich wife. But
she troubles him, he say. Troubles him to no end. You should hear
him go on about this poor gal. Made me feel bad for her.
---
## ESTHER:
She terrible, I'm sure. But just the same, you on uneasy
ground.
---
## MAYME:
You find it shocking?
---
## ESTHER:
Yes, I find it shocking.
---
## MAYME:
Hush your mouth, you wouldn't understand. You want
to see what my songbird give me? (Mayme pulls George's Japanese
smoking jacket from beneath her pillow. She displays it proudly.) And
you know me, I don't usually take gifts from men, but when he give
me this, it took my breath away. It's so pretty. Look Esther. Feel it.
---
## ESTHER:
He give you this?
---
## MAYME:
Yup.
---
## ESTHER:
He must like you a bunch to give you something so fine.
---
## MAYME:
What can I tell you, the man got taste, honey.
---
## ESTHER:
I've only seen fabric like this just once before. It's
Japanese silk.
---
## MAYME:
How'd you know?
---
## ESTHER:
It's expensive fabric. Very hard to find. You see the
pictures were embroidered by an imperial artist, he signed it there.
He give you this?
---
## MAYME:
He say I his gal. But this time a little part of me is hoping
he telling the truth.
---
## ESTHER:
And what about his wife?
---
## MAYME:
What about her? I'm sure she just a sorry gal.
---
## ESTHER:
How you know she ain't a good person? And he just
saying what you want to hear. That his words are a smooth tonic to
make you give out what ain't free. How you know his wife ain't good?
---
## MAYME:
I don't know. But do it matter?
---
## ESTHER:
Yeah it do. You ever think about where they go after
they leave here? Who washes their britches after they been soiled in
your bed?
---
## MAYME:
No, I don't actually. Why would I?
---
## ESTHER:
'Cause there's some poor woman out there waiting,
getting up every five minutes, each time a carriage pass the window
or a dog bark Who thinks a great deal of her husband, thinks so
much of him that she don't bother to ask questions, she just know
that there are places that he go that gentlewomen don't belong.
---
## MAYME:
I don't want to hear it.
49
---
## ESTHER:
She thinks he's playing cards or simply restless. But still
when the door opens and he lies down next to her, that poor stupid
woman don't feel angry, because his body is warm and she ain't alone.
---
## MAYME:
What?! You troubled because he married? They all
married. You ain't completely clean of this business. Truth. No, I
don't care to think about those women. I don't care to think about '
the kind of lives that keep them sitting in their windows, worrying
while their husbands —
---
## ESTHER:
I pity your heart. You are the worst sort of scavenger.
(Lights rise on George and Esther's boudoir. George stands in a
brand-new suit.)
---
## MAYME:
What's the matter with you?
---
## ESTHER:
I don't feel so good. That's all.
---
## MAYME:
I thought you'd be happy for me.
---
## ESTHER:
I think I'm gonna go home, if you don't mind. (Lights
cross ide. Esther and George's  boudDir George stands in a new wool suit.)
---
## GEORGE:
Yuh t'ink I'd be taken for a Yankee gentleman? I do
t'ink so, no? I'd like one them tall hats, whatcha call 'em? Like that
fella across the way, yuh know, the one always be talkin' about 'e rich
brother in Chicago. (Affecting an American accent.)Yes, sir my name
George Armstrong and I from New York, yes sir, born here. (George
laughs.) It fit real nice. But, it seem to me that the fellas be wearin'
shorter jackets with. a touch of color. (Esther pins Geb;ge's pants.)
---
## ESTHER:
Sporting fellas, they ain't gentlemen. This Scottish
wool. It white-folk quality and it'll keep you warm through the
winter. There is a lovely story —
---
## GEORGE:
Yeah? I'm sure it excitin'. (Esther runs her hands down
Gemge's legs, then adjusts the hem. He does not respond to her touch.)
---
## ESTHER:
Be that way, I won't tell it then. There. You look good,
George. Really. Now take off the pants so I can hem them proper.
---
## GEORGE:
Nah, don't bother. I need them for this evenin'.
---
## ESTHER:
This evening? Why? Don't go out. I bought fresh pork
chops from Mrs. Franklin's son. I was gonna smother them in onions,
the way you like. But it ain't worth the trouble if you ain't gonna
eat. And and I have something for you, I was going to save it for
later but (A moment.) Do you want to see?
---
## GEORGE:
(Excited.) Sure.
---
## ESTHER:
Close your eyes. C'mon. And don't smile. (George closes
his eyes. Esther puts a rose in her hair and a touch cf color on her lips.
She nervously slips °fiber dress, revealing an elaborate coact similar to
50
Mayme's.) You can open your eyes. (Esther awkwardly poses, awaiting
George's reaction. His disappointment is palpable. He clearly was
expecting something else. George chuckles to himself with a mixture
of amusement and disgust.)
---
## GEORGE:
What yuh doing?
---
## ESTHER:
Don't you like it?
---
## GEORGE:
Come, put yuh dothin' on.
---
## ESTHER:
What's the matter? Ain't this to your liking? Ain't this
what you want? (Esther places George's hands around her waist.) Feel
it. It satin. See.
---
## GEORGE:
No, don't do this Esther. C'mon, this aid yuh. 'Ear.
---
## ESTHER:
(Timidly) If I ain't mistaken, a man has certain obliga-
tions. (A moment.) Why won't you touch me? (A moment.)
---
## GEORGE:
You want me to touch yuh?
---
## ESTHER:
Yes. (George grabs Ea-her around the waist. He plants a
heavy hard kiss on her mouth. She nevertheless succumbs to his touch.)
---
## GEORGE:
Like so? You want me to touch you. That all you want
of George? You want me to bend and please, so you can feel mighty.
No. (George pushes Esther away.) 'Least in Panama a man know
where 'e stand. 'E know 'e chattel. That as long as 'e have a goat 'e
happy. 'E know when 'e drunk, 'e drunk and there aid no judgment
if so. But then 'e drink in words of this woman. She tell 'e about the
pretty avenues, she tell 'e plentiful. She fill up 'e head so it 'ave no
taste for goat milk. She offer 'e the city stroke by stroke. She tantalize
'e with Yankee words. But 'e not find she. Only this woman 'ere, that
say touch me, George. And ask 'e to lie down on what she promise,
lie down on 'e stable with a dozen strong horses for the work sites,
ask 'e to lie down as they haul lumber and steel. Strong sturdy
beasts. They are. 'E lie down, but what 'e get? No, he ain't gonna lie
down no more.
---
## ESTHER:
Stop it. Why you talking this way?
---
## GEORGE:
I t'ink yuh know. (A moment. George eyes the quilt.)
---
## ESTHER:
No. Please don't ask me again.
---
## GEORGE:
But it there dreamin' a fine fine house wit it own yard.
It taunt 'e so, 'e can't even show what kind of man 'e be. -What 'e
hands can do.
---
## ESTHER:
No. That half my life. Thousands of tiny stitches and
yards of fabric passed through that old machine.
---
## GEORGE:
And for what, huh? For it sit?
---
## ESTHER:
No.
5 I
---
## GEORGE:
Stop sayin' no! Ain't you see. If 'e own wife ain't
to believe in 'e, who will? 'E stand in work lines that wind around
city blocks. But 'e don't have to no more, 'cause 'e know a fella got
twelve draft horses and want to sell them quick quick. And 'e buy
them and in two years, they'll have enough money for a beauty parlor
even. They'll have the finest stable in New York City. People'll tip
their hats and pay tribute. They'll call them Mr. and Mrs. Armstrong.
The Armstrongs. Them church ladies will clear the front row just for
them. And 'e will —
---
## ESTHER:
(Wants to believe him.) He will what?
---
## GEORGE:
'E will sit with she and nod graciously to the ladies. 'E
will come home for supper every evenin'. (Seductively) 'E will lie
with she.
---
## ESTHER:
Only she? (George strokes Esther' back tenderly, she savors
his touch. He kisses her neck, her back, her shoulders, her breasts. He
embraces her, almost too much so. Esther nevertheless surrenders to the
unexpected affection) Are you telling me the truth? Is this the truth?
---
## GEORGE:
Yesb
---
## ESTHER:
Please, you're not just saying that. You're not laughing
at me are you?
---
## GEORGE:
No, I am' laughid. (Finally, Esther break the embrace.
She hesitates, then tears into the quilt, wrenching it apart with her
bare bands. She pulls the money out and examines it, before placing it
in George's outstretched bands)
---
## ESTHER:
There. Mere. There. (She's almost relieved to be shedding
the money. Swprised, George smiles and gathers the money into a pile.)
---
## GEORGE:
So much 'ere. Sweet mercy, look at it all. Good lord,
that fella am' gonna believe it. I gonna place the money square in 'e
hand, wipe that silly Yankee grin off 'e lips. I show 'e.
---
## ESTHER:
George, it's late, you ain't gotta do this now put it
back. It'll still be there in the morning.
---
## GEORGE:
Woman, how yuh get so much?
---
## ESTHER:
Leave it. Come. George, I said put it.back, it'll be there
in the morning! (Esther beckons him to the bed He looks at her
pleading outstretched hand, but instead chooses to fetch a worn bagfor
the wrinkled money Esthen humiliated, studies her husband with
growing horror. Aghast, she slowly lowers her hand and pulls on her
dress.) George? (Geoge continues to take unbridled delight in the
money.) Geo rge?
---
## GEORGE:
(Snaps.) What?
52
---
## ESTHER:
(Whi3pered.) Do you love me?
---
## GEORGE:
What the matter wit' you? You look as though you
seen a duppy.
---
## ESTHER:
Do I?
---
## GEORGE:
Why yuh look at me strange?
---
## ESTHER:
I asked you something.
---
## GEORGE:
Yuh my wife, ain't
---
## ESTHER:
Am I? (Whispered.) I didn't write them letters.
---
## GEORGE:
I didn' hear what yuh said.
---
## ESTHER:
(Louder, almost too much so.) I said I didn't write them
letters. (George studies Esther with disbelief)  All this rime I was
afraid that you'd find me out. This good noble man from Panama.
(Esther retrieves a pile of letters tied with a satin ribbon.) I have all of
your letters here. I look at them every day. I have one that looks as
though it's weeping, because the words fade away into nothing, and
another that looks as if it's been through a hard day, because there's
a smudge of dirt at each corner, and it smells of kerosene and burnt
sugar. But I can't tell you what it say, because I don't read. I can't tell
whether there are any truths, but I keep them, 'cause George give me
his heart, though it covered in mud and filthy, but he give it to me in
one of these letters. And I believed him. I believed him! (A moment.)
But you ain't the man in these letters, because that gentleman would
have thanked me. 'Who wrote them letters, George? Tell me! (George
considers.) YOU TELL ME!
---
## GEORGE:
An old mulatto man. I paid him ten cents for each letter,
ten cents extra for the fancy writing.
---
## ESTHER:
I ain't really Mrs. Armstrong, am I? I been holding on
to that, and that woman ain't real. We more strangers now than on
the eve of our wedding. At least I knew. who I was back then. But I
ain't gonna let you hurt that woman. No! She's a good decent woman
and worthy. Worthy!
---
## GEORGE:
Esther! (George reaches out to Esther)
---
## ESTHER:
No, don't touch me! (Esther backs away from George.)
---
## GEORGE:
Please. I am' a thief. No. They wam't my words, but
that don't mean I ain't feel them eings. I go now, and I gonna bring
yuh back them horses.
---
## ESTHER:
I hope they real strong horses.
---
## GEORGE:
You'll see. And, we'll begin here. (Lights crossfide.
Mayme's boudoir. Ragtime music plays, fast and fitrious.)

Scene 5
Smoking Jacket
Mayme's boudoir. Mayme is lying on the bed wrapped in the
Japanese smoking jacket. She sits up, pours herself a shot of
moonshine and slams it back. A knock sounds on the doon
---
## MAYME:
Hold on, hold on. (Mayme opens the door. Esther, calm,
enters. Mayme's unable to disguise her surprise.) Esther. What I got
someone coming shortly. You can't stay. (Mayme nervously wraps the
robe around her body.) I can't put him off. You understand. Come
back later and we'll catch up. (Esther grabs Mayme's arm.) What's
wrong? (Esther gathers her strength.)
---
## ESTHER:
He gone.
---
## MAYME:
Who gone?
---
## ESTHER:
George.
---
## MAYME:
You ain't serious.
---
## ESTHER:
He has another woman.
---
## MAYME:
How do you know?
---
## ESTHER:
She told me so.
---
## MAYME:
She did? Well, she must be a cruel heartless heifer.
---
## ESTHER:
You think so?
---
## MAYME:
Yes.
---
## ESTHER:
But, she ain't. When I left home this morning I intended
to do harm to his whore. I was going to march into her room and
scratch her face with my scissors. I was going to scar her. Make
her ugly. Make her feel what I'm feeling. But, she gonna know
soon enough.
---
## MAYME:
You gotta go now.
---
## ESTHER:
No.
---
## MAYME:
Please, we'll talk about it later. I got someone coming.
---
## ESTHER:
Do you know what I done? I tore a hole in my quilt and
give him my beauty parlor. Half my life bent at the machine, and I
give it to him, just like that.
---
## MAYME:
Oh, Esther. Why?
54
---
## ESTHER:
I wanted to be held. (Distracted.) I thought if He ain't
come home last night. I sat at the sewing machine all night, trying
to make something, I just kept sewing together anything I could
find until I had a strip a mile long, so long it fill up the apartment.
(A moment. Mayme runs herfingers along the fabric of the jacket.) Do
you know where he is, Mayme?
---
## MAYME:
Why would I know?
---
## ESTHER:
Because you're wearing the jacket I give him on our
wedding night.
---
## MAYME:
How come you ain't say nothing before? (Mayme, honfieeZ
TipS off the jacket.)
---
## ESTHER:
What am I gonna say?
---
## MAYME:
Yeah, yeah. Last night Songbird come around the saloon
in a new suit with bottomless pockets, throwing dice all night, and
boasting of easy money. I ask him where he got the money and he
say his luck turn and he was gonna ride it out. If you can imagine
that. He was gonna buy himself draft horses. The world changing
and he wants big strong horses. He made me laugh. He promised
to take me out someplace special, but I didn't have nothing nice to
wear. And honestly it made me think about how long it been since
I done something for myself. Gone someplace like you said, where
a colored woman could go to put up her feet and get treated good
for a change. And I see the dice rolling, and I think Lord, God,
wouldn't a place like that be wonderful. But every time the dice
roll, that place is a little further away. Until it all gone. And then I
put my arms around this man, and I know who he is. He George.
And maybe I known all along.
---
## ESTHER:
Why didn't you stop him?
---
## MAYME:
Because, he belong to me as well. (Mayme places it in
Esther's hands.) But this yours.
---
## ESTHER:
Foolish country gal.
---
## MAYME:
No, you are grand, Esther. And I ain't worthy of your
forgiveness, nor will forget what you done for me. You ain't never
treat me like a whore. Ever. (George knocks on doon)
---
## ESTHER:
Please don't answer that door. (Gene rattles door and
knocks.) Please don't, please don't answer.
---
## MAYME:
He's going to leave.
---
## GEORGE:
(Knocks and rattles door more urgently, shouts.) Mayme!
(He rattles door again.)
---
## ESTHER:
LET HIM GO! (Mayme moves toward the door, Esther
55
grabs her arm.) Let him go. He ain't real, he a duppy, a spirit. We
be chasing him forever. (George knocks and rattles door even more
persistenv. Eventually he stops. Silence. Mayme sits on her bed. Esther
exits with the smoking jacket. Crossfiide to Mr. Mark's boudoir, as
Esther moves into Mr. Mark's boudoir.)
Scene 6
Japanese Silk
Marks' boudoir. Mr. Marks unfurlc a roll of ocean-blue fabric.
As he turns, he finds himseffacing Esther.
---
## ESTHER:
Hello, Mr. Marks.
---
## MARKS:
(Surprised.) Miss Mills, I'm sorry, Mrs. Armstrong. How
have you been?
---
## ESTHER:
I seen worse days. And you?
---
## MARKS:
I've seen better days. (He laughs.)
---
## ESTHER:
I've been meaning to stop in. I walked past here a half
dozen times trying to get up the courage to come in. You remember
you sold me a rather special length of fabric some time ago.
---
## MARKS:
Please, remind me.
---
## ESTHER:
Japanese silk, with —
---
## MARKS:
Of course, I remember it.
---
## ESTHER:
Well, I made it into a man's smoking jacket, at your
suggestion. (She holds it up.)
---
## MARKS:
It is very nice, it will please your husband, I'm sure.
---
## ESTHER:
I want you to have it.
---
## MARKS:
Me? I can't —
tsTHER. Yes, you will. (Marks accepts the jacket, genuinely touched
by the gesture.)
---
## MARKS:
Thank you.
---
## ESTHER:
I can't stay. (Esther begins to leave.)
---
## MARKS:
Wait, one moment. (He removes his outer jacket, revealing
the fringes of his Tallit Katan. He carefidly puts on the silk jacket.)
What do you think?
56
---
## ESTHER:
It fits wonderfully. (Esther takes a step toward Marks,
hesitates, then takes another step forward. She raises her hands.) May I?
(He nervously holdc his breath and nods yes. Esther reaches toward
Marks, expecting him to move away. She smoothes the shoulders of the
garment, then expertly runs her hands down the jacket's lapels,
straightening the wrinkled material. Marks does not move. Silence.
Their eyes are fixed upon one another, then Esther reluctantly walks
away, exiting the boudoir without a word. Marks is left alone onstage
to contemplate the moment. A gentle rag plays. Lights crossfade; we're
in Esther's original boudoir.)
Scene 7
Patchwork Quilt
Esther's boudoir. Mrs. Dickson's rooming house. Mrs. Dickson
folds laundry, humming a ragtime tune. Esther enters.
---
## ESTHER:
The girl downstairs told me I could find you up here.
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
My Lord, Mrs. Armstrong. I been telling every-
one how you forgot us.
---
## ESTHER:
It ain't been that long.
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
Feel so. (The women hug.) Look at you. I was
about to take some tea, come on into the kitchen, I'm glad for the
company. These new girls are always out and about. They trouble
me so these days, but whatcha gonna do? And I want to hear about
everything.
---
## ESTHER:
Have you rented this room?
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
Why do you ask?
---
## ESTHER:
I don't much feel like saying why. If you please, just a
yes or no would suit me fine.
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
No.
---
## ESTHER:
Well then, you won't mind another person at supper
this evening. It's Friday and you don't know how I been missing
your carrot salad.
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
Of course. Esther —
57
---
## ESTHER:
I'm fine. (Esther takes Mrs. Dickson's hand) And I'd love
that cup of tea.
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
Come on downstairs and we'll catch up. I'll tell
you about Corinna Mae, girl's as big as a house, I swear to God.
(Etthei; barely listening takes in the room.) She didn't waste any time
getting pregnant and already talking nonsense about her man.
When they first was married he was good enough for her, but to
hear it now you'd think the man didn't have no kind of sense.
---
## ESTHER:
I don't care to hear about Corinna Mae.
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
Oh, I just thought —
---
## ESTHER:
I'd like to sit here for a moment.
---
## MRS. DICKSON:
Oh, yes. I gotta bring a few more things in off
the line before the sunset, I'll see you downstairs shortly.
---
## ESTHER:
Of course. Mrs. Dickson, thank you for not asking.
(Mrs. Dickson lovingly takes Esther's hand, giving it a supportive
squeeze. Mrs. Dickson picks to the launehy basket and exits, Esther
lightly touches her belly. A inoment. She walks over to the old sewing
machine and begins to sew together pieces offabric, the beginnings ofa
new quilt. Lights shift: sepia tone, the quality of an old photograph. A
slow, gentle mg plays in the distance. As the lights fiide, projected title
card: "Unidentified Negro Seamstress. ca. 1905" Blackout.)
