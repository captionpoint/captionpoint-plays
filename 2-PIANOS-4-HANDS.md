Stop playing. Stop playing. Stop playing.

How many flats are there in the key signature, Richard?

Four, Sister Loyola. 

### TED
Mmm. And they are?

### RICHARD
Um… B, um… E, um… C—

No. Just down a little spacey from C.

A!

Yes. And…

### TED
BEAD. Yes, good. 

### RICHARD
BEAD! 

---

### TED
Yes. 

### RICHARD
BEAD!! 

---

### TED
Very good, dear. So, what key are we in, Richard?

---

How do we know what key we’re in, dear? Remember? 

---

### RICHARD
Oh! You take the last flat— 

### TED
No, dear. The second to the last flat. 

---

### RICHARD
Second to the last flat— 

### TED
Yes, which is what? 

---

### RICHARD
A! A flat! We’re in A flat! 

### TED
Almost, dear. 

---

Is this a happy-sounding song or a sad-sounding song?

---

Does it have a happy sound or does it have a sad sound? 

---

### RICHARD
[RICHARD plays a short section.]
A sad sound. 

---

### TED
Yes. And when it’s sad, it’s…? 

### RICHARD
Minor! 

---

### TED
Yes. Very good, dear. Minor is sad. Minor is dark and gloomy. Whereas major is - 

## BOTH
-happy. 

---

### TED
So. If this were a happy-sounding song then we would be in…? 

### RICHARD
A. 

---

### TED
A what? 

### RICHARD
A flat. 

---

### TED
A flat what? 

### RICHARD
A flat minor! 

---

### TED
No, major, Richard!! 

### RICHARD
Major. 

---

### TED
Yes? 

### RICHARD
Yes. 

---

### TED
But it’s not a happy-sounding song— 

### RICHARD
Nope. 

---

### TED
It’s a sad-sounding song— 

### RICHARD
Yep. 

---

### TED
So we’re not in a major key. 

### RICHARD
Nope. 

---

### TED
We’re in a minor key. 

### RICHARD
Yep. 

---

### TED
And the relative minor of A flat major is…?

---

How do we find the relative minor of a major key, dear? We’ve done this. Remember? We go…

Oh, Richard. Three. Three semitones. Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.

Whatever, dear. 

### RICHARD
F. F flat. We’re in F flat minor!

---

### TED
Not F flat, dear! Just F! F minor! Okay. 

### RICHARD
Okay. 

---

### TED
Now, F minor has four flats. 

### RICHARD
Yes, Sister. 

---

### TED
And what are they, dear? 

### RICHARD
Um… B, um… E, um… C— 

---

### TED
No Richard. What’s the saying that we use that helps us remember what the order of the flats is? 

---

### RICHARD

---

### TED
Charles Father. 

### RICHARD
Charles Father.

[TED begins to play a jaunty, off kilter tune.]

### RICHARD (as MR. BERKOFF)
Okay. Okay. Teddy. Stop playing. Stop playing. Stop playing. 

---

### TED
It sounded a lot better at home. 

---

### RICHARD
Okay, Teddy, why don’t you try counting out loud while you play? 

### TED
Mr. Berkoff? 

---

### RICHARD
Count out loud while you play. 

---

[TED plays, counting continuously and not in time.]

---

### RICHARD
Whoa, whoa, whoa. 

---

### TED
That’s hard. 

### RICHARD
Teddy. What’s the time signature of the piece? 

---

### TED
Yes. 

### RICHARD
The time signature, Ted? 

---

### TED
Four… two fours… four over four… forty-four. 

---

### RICHARD
Didn’t your last teacher go over this with you? Didn’t she teach you about time signatures? 

---

### TED
Well sort of, I guess. 

---

### RICHARD
Didn’t she make sure that you understood the concept of time? 

---

### TED
Whoa. 

---

### RICHARD
Well what the heck did she do? 

---

### TED
She usually just went upstairs for a little lie down and a cup of tea,

---

and when my lesson was over I would let myself out and my dad would get mad at me. 

---

### RICHARD
I don’t believe this. Okay. Okay. Teddy, we call the time signature of this piece four-four. 

---

### TED
Four-four. 

### RICHARD
Now. It’s also called common time. 

---

That’s why you sometimes see a C at the beginning of the piece. 

---

### TED
Oh boy. 

### RICHARD
But we’ll just call it four-four for now. 

---

### TED
Four-four for now. 

---

### RICHARD
Just four-four. 

### TED
Just four-four. 

---

### RICHARD
Four-four. 

### TED
Four-four. 

---

### RICHARD
Okay. 

### TED
Okay. 

---

### RICHARD
Now. Four-four means…? 

### TED
Four. 

---

### RICHARD
Four what? 

---

### TED
For the music. 

---

### RICHARD
Teddy. The top four means…? 

### TED
The best ones. 

---

### RICHARD
Okay, okay. In a time signature, the top number tells us how many beats there are in each bar. 

---

The bottom number tells us what each one of those beats is worth. 

---

So, if we’re in four-four that means there are how many what’s in a what? 

---

### TED
What? 

---

### RICHARD
How many beats in the bar? 

---

### TED
Four? 

### RICHARD
Yes! Four! Very good! 

---

Now the bottom four tells us what each one of those four beats is worth… and that is? 

---

### TED
Four! 

---

### RICHARD
No. Okay. Let’s try something else… 

---

Okay. Okay, okay, okay. We’ve got a pie, okay? 

### TED
What kind? 

---

### RICHARD
Well, whatever kind you want— 

### TED
Blueberry. 

---

### RICHARD
Fine. We want to cut up this blueberry pie into four equal pieces, okay? 

### TED
Sure! 

---

### RICHARD
Good. So if we have four equal pieces of pie— 

### TED
Where is it? 

---

### RICHARD
Let’s forget about the pie. 

---

### TED
That’s mean. 

---

### RICHARD
Okay, okay, okay, okay. What’s this? 

### TED
A dollar. 

---

### RICHARD
Yes. Each bar is worth a dollar. 

### TED
Wow! 

---

### RICHARD
Now we already know there are four beats in each bar; that means that each beat is worth…? 

---



### TED
Oh! Twenty-five cents. 

---

### RICHARD
Yeah… and another way of saying twenty-five cents is…? 

### TED
Two bits. 

---

### RICHARD
And another way of saying two bits is…? 

---

### TED
Well, a quarter— 

### RICHARD
YES!! 

---

A QUARTER! A quarter what? A quarter… 

---

### TED
pounder? 

---

### RICHARD
No. A quarter noo… 

### BOTH
Nooo… noooo… nooooo… 

---

### RICHARD
Note! 

### TED
Note! 

---

### RICHARD
A quarter note! 

### TED
Okay, I’ve heard of them.

---

### RICHARD
Four beats in each bar and each beat is worth a quarter note. And that’s how we count the piece! 

---

### TED
Uh huh. How? 

---

### RICHARD
We count… one quarter, two quarter, three quarter, four quarter, new dollar. 

---

One quarter, two quarter, three quarter, four quarter.

### TED
New dollar. 

---

### RICHARD
Yes. Now play and count out loud. 


---
template: noise
[Ted counts as he plays, out of time with the music]

---

### TED
One, two, three, four, one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four&#8288;—

---

### RICHARD
No, Teddy. No. 

### TED
Three bucks! 

---

### RICHARD
Teddy, what do we call these notes? 

### TED
Eee’s. 

---

### RICHARD
Yes, but we’re talking about the time here, Teddy. The time. 

---

How much time do we spend on each of those notes? 

---

### TED
It seems like forever, Mr. Berkoff. 

---

### RICHARD
Okay, you see those notes have little tails on them? 

### TED
Yeah. 

---

### RICHARD
Well that means there are two of those notes with the little tails on them in every quarter note. 

---

Which means that each one of those notes with the little tails on them is worth half a quarter. 

---

And another way of saying half a quarter is…? 

---

### TED
Twelve and a half cents. 

---

### RICHARD
And another way of saying twelve and half cents is…?! 

---

### TED
I don’t know… one bit? 

### RICHARD
NO!!

---

Yes. One bit. We can actually count the piece that way. Play it, Teddy. Play it.

---
template: noise
[Teddy starts playing]

---

One bit, two bit, three bit, four bit, 

---
template: noise
[TED begins to count along.]

---



one bit, two bit, three bit, four bit.

---

Well, there you go! But the “one,” the “two,” the “three,” and the “four” are more important than the “bits.”

---

They’re louder, so we actually go… 

---

Okay, okay, okay, but the “one” is the most important and the “two,” the “three,” 

---

and the “four” are less important, so we actually go… 

---
template: noise
[They count two bars out again, emphasizing the “one.”]

---

Okay, okay. Okay! But the “three” is also important—it’s not as important as the “one” but it’s still important, so we actually go… 

---

[They count again, emphasizing the one and the three—four bars this time.]

### TED
Okay, thank you, Richard. Thank you. Did you practise at all this week? 

---

### RICHARD
Yes I did. Half an hour every day, Mr. Morton. 

---

### TED
Uh huh. And you included that piece in your practising, did you? 

### RICHARD
Yeah, I sure did. 

---

### TED
Okay. Let’s try it again. 

---



[Richard plays again]

---

Hang on a second. What are you doing with your arm there, buddy? What about the fingering? 

---

### RICHARD
Fingering? 

### TED
Didn’t your old teacher teach you about fingering? 

---

### RICHARD
Well, kind of, I guess. 

### TED
What the heck did she do? 

---

### RICHARD
Well, she usually went upstairs for a cup of tea and a lie down. 

---

### TED
All right, all right, all right, all right. Play me an F major scale, buddy, I’ve seen you do that. 

---

[Richard plays the scale perfectly]

---



There you go. That’s all there is to it. Now have a gander at the second bar. 

---

Tell me what that is without the rest of the piece around it? 

---

### RICHARD
It’s a going-down F major scale. 

### TED
So, what do think about that? 

---

### RICHARD
You mean you use the same fingering?! 

### TED
Well sure you do. 

---

That’s why we make you practise the scales. We don’t do it just to be mean. They actually show up in the pieces. 

---

[Richard plays the piece successfully]

Wow!!

---

### TED
There you go. Enjoy yourself. See ya next week!

---

### RICHARD
Well, that was much better, wasn’t it? 

### TED
Yeah! 

---

### RICHARD
That method of counting really helped, didn’t it? 

### TED
Yeah!

### RICHARD
You’re starting to have some fun now, aren’t you? 

### TED
Yeah! 

---

### RICHARD
But you’re still not doing it right.

Every one bit, two bit, three bit, four bit has to be the same. So, practise with that.

---

### TED
Well hey! That’s a whole heck of a lot better, isn’t it?

### TED
That way of fingering really helped, didn’t it? 

### RICHARD
Yeah!

### TED
You’re starting to have some fun, huh?

Oh yeah!

I’m bored.

Oh, you’re bored, are you?

You’re bored with Mozart? The greatest musical genius in the history of mankind bores my son. 

---

Well, we’re so sorry, Richard. We’ll try to do better for you, Richard. 

---

### RICHARD
Well this isn’t exactly a work of genius. 

---

I mean, look what it’s called: the Sonata Facile. The easy sonata. 

---

### TED
That doesn’t mean that it is easy, that means it’s supposed to sound easy. 

---

Ironically, that is a very difficult thing to do! I remember when I played this one… 

---

### RICHARD
[in quiet pain]
Oh God no… 

---

### TED
…a little slower than you, but that’s up to the individual. 
[TED begins to play.]

---

Right from the beginning— 

### RICHARD
Dad! 

---

### TED
—you have to give the listener the illusion of simplicity. 

### RICHARD
Dad!

### TED
You can’t fake your way through these scales— 

### RICHARD
Earth to Dad!!

I already have a teacher, you know. I don’t want a lesson every single time I practise.

### TED
God, you know, you just amaze me sometimes! Do you know how lucky you are to have me helping you?!

When I was your age I didn’t have a me to help me. 

---

You have the opportunity to be a better player than I ever was and instead you fight me every step of the way!!! 

---

### RICHARD
Will you please stop yelling at me?! 

### TED
All right, that’s it! 

---

I’ve had it with this, mister. This is a waste of your time and my money!

I’ll call Mrs. George right now and tell her you’re going to quit the piano. How would you like that? 

---

### RICHARD
Fine. Go ahead! 

### TED
I will! 

---

### RICHARD
Do it, see if I care! 

### TED
You’re messing with the wrong guy.

---

It’s ringing. Two rings. 

---

Hello, Mrs. George—this is Richard Greenblatt’s father, Mr. Greenblatt. Richard has something he’d like to say. 

---

### RICHARD
Hello, Mrs. George. I think I’m… 

---

not quite sure what I’m supposed to be practising this week. 

---

Uh hunh. Uh hunh. Oh yeah, the Sonata Facile, I thought so. Okay. See you Saturday. Okay, bye. 

---

### TED
So you don’t want to quit? 

### RICHARD
No. 

---

### TED
Well, that’s what I thought.

---

[RICHARD starts to cry.] 

Aw, Rich… Okay, Daddy shouldn’t have done that… That was not very fair… 

---

We won’t tell Mom? I’m sorry about that, okay? 

---

Who’s my guy? Huh, Richie? Who’s my guy? 

---

We can’t keep doing this, Richard. I don’t want to go through this every single time you practise. 

---

It’s just that you’re so good, you know, son. That’s why daddy cares so much. 

---

And when daddy cares a lot, daddy gets loud. 

---

Now I want you to make a deal with me, okay? 

---

### RICHARD
What kind of deal? 

---

### TED
A pact. If you’re going to commit to this, seriously commit to classical music, 

---

then you’re going to practise for one hour every day— 

### RICHARD
One hour?! 

---

### TED
Every day, without exception— 

### RICHARD
Even on my lesson days?! 

---

### TED
Especially on your lesson days. 

### RICHARD
Don’t I get any days off? 

---

### TED
All right, National holidays. 

### RICHARD
Oh, gee thanks. 

---

### TED
And without ever, ever, ever complaining about it or goofing around during that hour. 

---

Outside that hour I think you should goof around—I think it’s great and I encourage it—

---

but inside that hour I want you to devote yourself to the practice, perfection, and performance of classical music, 

---

from now until you’re seventeen years old. 

---

### RICHARD
Seventeen?! 

### TED
Yes. 

---

### RICHARD
That’s seven more years! 

### TED
That’s how old I was when I quit. 

---

And then you can do whatever you like. If you still want to quit right now, today, you’re free to do so.

---

I’m your father, I’ll always love you. I will respect your decision. 

---

What do you say? Deal? 

---

### RICHARD
You gotta make a deal with me too. 

---

### TED
Okay, that’s fair enough, sir, you name it. 

---

### RICHARD
You have to promise to never… ever… ever… ever… practise with me for the rest of your life.

You don’t want my help?

No.

HI. 

### TED
HI.

### RICHARD
Excuse me, may I have some room please? 

### TED
Certainly. 

---

### RICHARD
Thank you. And how are you today? 

---

### TED
I’m very well, thank you. Et vous? 

---

### RICHARD
Très bien, merci, except for the fact that the bench is too close. 

### TED
Well I like it this close. 

---

### RICHARD
Well I don’t. 

---

Merci beaucoup. One, two, three&#8288;—

---

### TED
Did we, or did we not, agree last week that I would count in the piece? 

---

### RICHARD
Je suis desolé. 

---

### TED
Quite all right. I’m sure you just oublier. Two, three, four—

### RICHARD
Oh come on, we don’t need that. 

---

### TED
Excusez-moi, Monsieur le Grande Fromage, this is Mozart that we’re practising, not some baby piece. 

---

Next week is the eleven and under competition and if we want to stand any chance of winning we have to take it seriously.

You did too.

Did too.

[The Mozart piece reaches its dramatic finale]

---

### BOTH 
See you next week. 

---

### TED
Thank you very much and good morning once again, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls.

I can’t get the music. 

### TED
If you don’t get the music I think I’m going to puke.

### RICHARD
Okay. Okay. Don’t puke.

[Ted begins to heave]

[to the adjudicator]
Excuse me, is it okay if we use our music?

You’re doing really well!

F sharp though. F sharp.

[Richard strikes the keys wildly in frustration]

### RICHARD
Shut up! 

---

Okay. You’re going to go from here to the end. 

---

### TED
I bumped my head. 

---

### RICHARD
Six months! Six months we’ve been working on this piece! 

---

Now, you are going to go from there to the end or I’m going to kill you!! One, two, three, four—


---

[Ted unwilingly complies. The intensity of the music matches the chaos of the moment.]

Mr. Dykstra. 

---

### TED
Oh God! 

---

### RICHARD
Welcome to your Conservatory of Music seventh grade piano examination! 

---

### TED
Oh God! 

---

### RICHARD
Now, before hearing your repertoire of pieces and doing some ear testing and some theory, 

---

we’ll begin with the required technical elements of the examination. 

---

As I’m sure you’re both well aware of and well prepared for, 

---

this will include scales, arpeggios, chords, and such in a key of my choosing. 

---

And the special key that I have chosen for you today is… C sharp!

### TED
Shit! 

---

### RICHARD
I’m sorry, Mr. Dykstra… did you say something? 

---

### TED
Sharp? 

---

### RICHARD
Yes. Sharp. We’ll begin with the C sharp major scale, parallel hands, 

---

four octaves, sixteenth notes and legato, when you are ready.

---
template: noise
[TED performs the scale well and quietly thanks God for his help.]

---

Good. The formula pattern, please.

---
template: noise
[TED aces it.] 

---

### TED
Yes!  Very good. The relative minor scale, please. 

---

[TED begins but RICHARD stops him.]

One moment. One moment, Mr. Dykstra. 

---

You’re playing the harmonic minor. 

### TED
Yes? 

---

### RICHARD
How many minor scales are there, young man? 

### TED
Three. 

---

### RICHARD
And they are? 

---

### TED
Harmonic, melodic, and regular, I mean natural! Regular?! 

---

### RICHARD
So, if I ask you for the relative minor scale of a given major key, 

---

the scale that I want has the same accidentals as its relative major, which would be? 

---

### TED
Oh. Just the natural minor scale? 

### RICHARD
Of course. 

---

### TED
You want me to play the natural minor scale first? 

---

### RICHARD
Absolutely. 

### TED
Okay. 

---

### RICHARD
Didn’t your teacher explain this to you? 

### TED
I’m sure he must have. 

---

### RICHARD
Proceed. 

---
template: noise
[TED plays well until the very last chord. 
An interesting variation that has an added extra note, making it sound jazzy.] 

---

The C sharp major arpeggio, please. 

---
template: noise
[TED plays it well]

---

Relative minor arpeggio… in tenths. 

---

### TED
Sorry? 

---

### RICHARD
The relative minor arpeggio in tenths. 

---

### TED
In tenths? 

### RICHARD
Yes. 

---

### TED
You mean a tenth apart? 

### RICHARD
Yes. 

---

### TED
Is that in the syllabus, sir? 

---

### RICHARD
I wrote the syllabus. 

---

### TED
Oh you’re that guy! 

---
template: noise
[He sort of attempts the arpeggio. It goes okay, but it's clear that he hasn't practiced it.]

---

### RICHARD
The C sharp major arpeggio again, please. Contrary motion this time. 

---

### TED
Contrary motion arpeggio?

---

So… the one hand would go the one way and the other hand would… 

---

Oooh, I don’t think so, sir! 

---

### RICHARD
Mr. Dykstra, did you practise those at all? 

### TED
No, sir, I did not. 

---

### RICHARD
And why not? 

### TED
I did not know I had to, sir. 

---

### RICHARD
Who is your teacher, young man? 

---

### TED
Mr. Berkoff. 

---

### RICHARD
Ah. “One-bit-two-bit-three-bit” Berkoff. 

---

Mr. Dykstra, I must tell you how very disappointed I am with how under-prepared you are in this area. 

---

### TED
Well, that would make two of us. 

---

### RICHARD
However, I am not going to blame you.

---

Do you know that I can tell by the time a student has played one scale whether or not they have talent? 

---

### TED
Oh boy. 

---

### RICHARD
You, Mr. Dykstra, you have talent. 

### TED
Oh boy! 

---

### RICHARD
What you do not have is a good teacher. And what you will not get on this examination… is a high mark. 

---

You are on the verge of graduating to a whole new level with your music. 

---

Soon you will be playing pieces by the masters, which will excite and challenge you in ways you’ve never dreamed.

---

[TED sighs.] 

Now, my advice to you is that after this examination is over, 

---

you have a long chat with your parents and seriously consider changing teachers. 

---

### TED
You mean just dumping Mr. Berkoff? 

---

### RICHARD
Basically yes. 

---

### TED
I’ve been with Mr. Berkoff my whole life. I like Mr. Berkoff. 

---

### RICHARD
And I like him too, but he can’t help you anymore. 

---

Mr. Berkoff is fine for beginners or young people who are not serious about playing well. 

---

Mr. Dykstra, are you serious about playing well? 

---

### TED
Yes. 

---

### RICHARD
Good. Now, I can give you the names of some excellent teachers or, who knows, maybe I’ll even take you on myself.

---
template: noise
[TED laughs nervously.] 

---

However, if you would like to achieve excellence, you will “dump” Mr. Berkoff and as soon as possible.

---

Now, let’s move on to some ear testing, shall we?

Why do you play these arpeggios avec une main… with one hand?

Well, that’s how it’s written, Monsieur Franck.

### RICHARD
And where does it say that? 

---

### TED
Well… it doesn’t exactly say that, but it doesn’t say not to play it with one hand. 

---

### RICHARD
Écoutes, Théodore! There is only one thing that matters when you play the piano… the sound. 

---

When you play the arpeggios with one hand, you cannot play them beautifully, 

---

all you can do is show you can play them with one hand.

you make love to them with your fingertips—of both hands.

You caress them.

You stroke them, 

[He plays the arpeggio.]

and you will make the most beautiful music together.

Play, Theodore. Play the arpeggios with both hands.

What do you mean, Mr. Scarlatti?

### TED
Why do play those arpeggios with-a two hand? 

---

### RICHARD
I don’t know, I just thought it’d be easier. That’s okay, isn’t it? 

---

### TED
No, it’s not okay. Where does it say in-a da music, “Hey, use-a two hand here, it’s-a easier?!” 

---

Enhh? Where does it say that? 

---

### RICHARD
Well, it doesn’t actually say that, but it doesn’t say not to play them with two hands either.

Richardo, Ricardo. Two-hand arpeggio is-a for da showboat guy.

You gonna be one of two hundred young people from around the world?

Yeah.

You know… You know who’s gonna be there?

Yeah. Some of the best kids and teachers from around the world. From China, Bulgaria, all over America.

Sure, sure. Never mind. There’s gonna be chicks! You like-a the chicks?

Well. . . I don’t get out much.

Dad.

### RICHARD
You’re playing very beautifully these days, son. 

---

### TED
Thanks.


---

### RICHARD
You know, when that adjudicator said that you were the reincarnation of Chopin, it made me very proud. 

---

### TED
Thanks, Dad, that means a lot to me. 

---

### RICHARD
Ted, I was wondering if I could have a word with you. 

---

### TED
Can this wait? I’m in the middle of practicing… 

---

### RICHARD
No, I’m sorry, it can’t wait. 

### TED
What are you doing? Don’t! 

---

### RICHARD
Ted, I’m a little concerned about you. 

---

### TED
Concerned what?! 

---

### RICHARD
Well, you’re spending all your time cooped up in here practising the piano. 

---

You don’t have much of a social life, you have very few friends… 

---

### TED
What are you talking about?! That’s not even true. What about Jonathan, my duet partner? 

---

Or the Monday night ear-training parties at Mr. Geizeking’s? 

---

### RICHARD
Yeah, Ted. I’m talking about non-music-related friends. Do you have any non-music-related friends? 

---

### TED
Why? 

---

### RICHARD
Because there is a world beyond the piano. What about sports, huh? You used to love playing hockey and baseball… 

---

### TED
Dad, I hurt my fingers. I couldn’t practise for two weeks! I almost missed the festival! 

---

### RICHARD
Well, there must be one sport that won’t hurt your little fingers?! 

---

### TED
Well, I don’t like Ping-Pong, what do you want me to do? 

---

### RICHARD
Ted, you gotta get outside more. When was the last time you were outside in the sun? 

---

### TED
This morning when I went to my lesson. 

---

### RICHARD
I’m talking about a non-music-related activity; 

---

when was the last time you even took part in a non-music-related activity? 

---

### TED
Why? 

---

### RICHARD
Because you’re becoming obsessive. 

---

I don’t think it’s healthy—

[RICHARD plays “Chopsticks”—TED interrupts him quickly] 

---

### TED
Dad. Dad. Dad! Get to the point, okay. I’m busy here. 

---

### RICHARD
All right. The point is your grades are slipping. 

---

### TED
That’s the point of this?! We’re going to do this now?! 

---

### RICHARD
You bet your little cotton socks we are. 

---

### TED
I’m in the middle of— 

### RICHARD
Ted, you used to be an honor student, now you’re barely passing. 

---

### TED
Getting B’s and C’s is not “barely passing,” for starters! 

---

### RICHARD
It is in my books. Now the only reason you’re not still getting Straight A’s 

---

is because you’re spending all your time at the piano. 

---

### TED
That’s what it takes at this stage of the game, Dad. 

---

### RICHARD
Well let me remind you what it takes to get into a good university at this stage of the game… 

---

### TED
I don’t need to be reminded…  

---

### RICHARD
Ted, it takes two to three hours a day of homework …


---


### TED
…what it takes to get into a good university, Dad! 

---

### Richard
it takes serious studying at exam time and, Ted, your SAT scores.

### TED
Please help me Lord! Excuse me… 

---

### TED
Excuse me!

---

I’m not going to go to college. 

---

### RICHARD
Ted, what are you talking about? 

### TED
I don’t need high marks in high school, Dad. 

---

### RICHARD
Says who?

### TED
Says Mr. Geizeking, for one. 

---

### RICHARD
Mr. Geizeking said that? 

### TED
Mr. Geizeking said that. 

---

### RICHARD
What else did Mr. Geizeking say? 

### TED
He said even high school is basically non-essential. 


---

### RICHARD
Oh, he did, did he? 

### TED
I’m going to be a professional musician, not a brain surgeon. 

---

### RICHARD
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on a second here. When was this decision made? 

---

### TED
A long time ago. 

---

### RICHARD
Well you can’t make a decision like that just like that. 

---

### TED
I can so. 

### RICHARD
You cannot. 

---

### TED
I can so! 

### RICHARD
You cannot! 

---

### TED
It’s my life! 

### RICHARD
Not yet it isn’t! 

---

### TED
Mr. Geizeking said Juilliard will accept anyone if they’re good enough regardless of their academic background. 

---

### RICHARD
Well Mr. Geizeking is not your father, I am. 

---

### TED
Don’t I know it. 

---

### RICHARD
All right. All right, you want to try to become a professional musician— 

---

### TED
You see, Dad, right there! I don’t want to try to become anything, 

---

I’m going to be a professional musician. That’s what I’m going to do. 

---

### RICHARD
Fine. Then you’re going to do it properly. You’ll get into a top-notch university— 

---

### TED
I highly doubt it. 

### RICHARD
—and then you’ll get a degree so that you’ll have something to fall back on. 

---

### TED
I don’t want anything to fall back on. 

---

### RICHARD
Ted. The music business is highly competitive. I mean, what happens if you’re not good enough to make it? 

---

What are you going to do—work in a piano bar? 

---

### TED
I don’t know. What would you like me to do, Dad? 

---

You want me to base my whole life’s plan on the fact that 

---

you think I’m going to fail at the one thing that I really love and that I’m really good at? 

---

Is that what you want me to do? Then I’d end up just like you.

---

### RICHARD
I’m a failure? 

---

### TED
I didn’t mean it like that— 

### RICHARD
I just started with nothing— 

---

### TED
I know you did, Dad— 

---

### RICHARD
—and I built up a business to the point where

### Ted
It’s just that you’re always saying that you never got to do what you wanted to do 

---

### RICHARD
—I’ve been able to provide for my family all these years, that’s all. 

---

### Ted
and you had to give everything up so that you could give us all the things you never had,

---

### RICHARD
 To pay for the best and most expensive piano teacher in this city Mr. Geizeking…

---

### Ted
…and that’s not something that I’m interested…

---

You don’t listen to what I say anyway!

---

### RICHARD
To buy you a goddamned grand piano! 

---

### TED
Well you’re my father, that’s your job! 

---

### RICHARD
You live in my house.

### TED
Oh God. 

---

### RICHARD
You eat the food I buy. You live the privileged life that I’ve— 

### TED
Privileged?! 

---

Oh this is the privileged life, is it? 

---

### RICHARD
Yes. Yes it is. You spoiled brat.

---

Now, you are going to get an eighty percent average, you’re going to go to a good university that is… 

---

### TED
[speaking over Richard]
I don’t have to go to university if I don’t want to&#8288;—

---

 

### RICHARD
…mutually agreed upon by the both of us,

---

or else there will be no more music in this house. Do you understand me, Ted? 

---

No lessons. No Mr. Geizeking and his Monday night ear-training parties. No piano at all. I’ll sell the goddamned thing.

What are you doing?

I was just practising. While I was waiting for you. And I started to fool around a little bit.

### RICHARD
For your information, that kind of fooling around is not allowed anywhere in this conservatory. 

---

What we do here is practise, perfect, and perform music. Serious music. 

---

### TED
I know that, sir. I was aware of the rules and I don’t have an excuse. 

---

I’m terribly embarrassed at the moment and I can only promise you that it will not happen again. 

---

### RICHARD
Very well. 

---

This is the second half of your audition into the conservatory, yesterday’s recital being the first. 

---

Today what we’ll do is we’ll chat for a bit. I’ll test your ear and your rhythm, 

---

and then I’ll give you some feedback from your recital yesterday, okay? 

---

### TED
Cool. 

---

### RICHARD
Let’s start with why you want to become a classi—do you want to become a classical musician? 

---

### TED
Yes, sir, of course I do. 

### RICHARD
Why? 

---

### TED
Well, I think it’s what I do best. A lot of people have encouraged me in this direction; 

---

I think it’s what I want to do with my life. 

---

### RICHARD
You think? 

### TED
No, I mean I know. I see what you’re trying to do here, sir. 

---

### RICHARD
What am I trying to do here? 

### TED
Trying to test my confidence level. 

---

### RICHARD
I don’t think you have a problem in that area. And what kind of music do you like best? 

---

### TED
Composers? 

### RICHARD
Okay. 

---

### TED
Well I’d have to say that the top three for me without a doubt are Bach, Beethoven, and Mozart. 

---

### RICHARD
And why are they your “top three”? 


---

### TED
There’s a lot of reasons. I think each one of those three guys changed totally what came before, 

---

they didn’t follow anyone else, they broke new ground, they inspire me personally. 

---

### RICHARD
They inspire me as well. 

---

### TED
Cool. 

---

### RICHARD
And where do you see yourself in say, ten years, as a classical pianist? 

---

### TED
Well hopefully I’ll be touring. Soloist. Soloist. 

---

### RICHARD
And if I were to say to you that you’re not good enough to be a soloist? 

---

That the best you could hope for is to be an accompanist, or a teacher? 

---

Would that change your mind about wanting to come here? 

---

### TED
No, sir. I see what you’re trying to do here; but I’m not afraid, I know I can do it. 

---

### RICHARD
Very well. Let’s move on to some ear testing, shall we? 

---

I’ll play some intervals and you tell me what they are, please. 

---

Turn around, Mr. Dykstra—you can see the hammers from there. 

---

[Richard plays a series of chords, Ted identifies each one correctly]

---


### TED
Diminished fifth. Minor sixth.  Major seventh. Minor ninth. 

---

### RICHARD
Yes. What’s this chord?

---

### TED
Augmented triad.

---

Diminished. 

### RICHARD
Diminished what? 

---

### TED
Diminished seventh.

---

That’s a major seventh chord. 

---

### TED
That’s… a good one. Could you play that again, please?

---

Oh! Thingy! It’s a minor chord with a major seventh on top. 

---

### RICHARD
We call that a minor major seventh chord.

---

### TED
Cool

---


### Richard
I’m going to clap four and I want you to clap three against it. 

---

### TED
Four against three? I can do that one myself. It’s just a little thing that I do! 

---

Four with the left hand… three with the right hand. 

---

### RICHARD
Very impressive. 

### TED
Thank you, sir. 


---

### RICHARD
I’d like you to play the A flat Schubert Impromptu that you played at yesterday’s recital. 

---

Can you take it from the middle of the recapitulation where the left hand has the melody? Do you know where I’m talking about? 

---

### TED
No problemo. 

---

### RICHARD
Whenever you’re ready, Mr. Dykstra.

---

[Ted plays the piece, it is very smooth and beautiful]

---

### RICHARD
You’re very talented. 

### TED
Thank you, sir. 

---

### RICHARD
Unfortunately, it’s wasted. Play it again from the beginning for me, please. 

---

I’d like you to take it significantly slower and no sustaining pedal. 

---

### TED
Is that how you think it should go, sir? 

---

### RICHARD
That’s how I’ve asked you to play it. 

---

### TED
No pedal?

---

[Ted begins to play, but it is the same speed]

### RICHARD
Mr. Dykstra. Significantly slower.

---

[TED tries to play it slowly. He can’t.] 

---

### TED
Sorry. I just have to do this for one second.

[He plays the opening line at the normal speed]

E-flat seven. Doi!

Mr. Dykstra. Pianissimo as written. Without the aid of the una corda pedal. 

---
template: noise
[TED continues unsuccessfully.] 

---

You see? You’re cheating the phrase. 

---

You’re faking it because you don’t have the discipline, the commitment, or the desire to perfect it. 

---

I’ve read your records; you’ve managed to impress a lot of adjudicators at the District finals 

---

but frankly, Mr. Dykstra, you don’t impress me. 

---

I find you to be a lazy, arrogant teenager who practises—what?—an hour and a half, two hours a day? 

---

There are hundreds of talented young people out there. 

---

I have thirteen-year-old students who could play circles around you.

---

They have no more talent—there’s only one difference between them and you. 

---

They work.

---

How dare you. How dare you waste your talent! 

---

Maybe, maybe—if you practise for five hours a day for two years—maybe you will qualify to enter into this program.

---

But frankly, Mr. Dykstra, I don’t believe you have it in you. 

---

Here. Here’s a quarter. 

---

Go and call your piano teacher, tell him that you will never ever be a classical pianist. 

---

Or you can use it to phone the conservatory to withdraw your application. 

---

Good day, Mr. Dykstra.

Thanks!

### TED
Welcome to the jazz faculty—the Jazz “Factory” as the kids like to call it. 

### RICHARD
That’s a good one. 

---

### TED
This is nothing to worry about, just a little “get to know ya,” talk about your background, 

---

try out your rhythm, test your ears, that kind of thing. 

---

We like to weed before we garden. So I understand you’ve got a classical background. 

---

That’s kinda weird, you want to tell me something about it? 

---

### RICHARD
Sure. I’ve been studying classically for about ten years but, I don’t know, recently I feel like I’ve hit a dead end. 

---

I’ve been thinking of giving up my classical training. 

---

### TED
Okay. Good idea. 

---

### RICHARD
In the last few years I’ve been in some rock groups. 

---

Um… progressive rock, celtic rock, klezmer rock, that kind of thing. I’ve been accompanying a lot of dance classes. 

---

### TED
Gross. 

---

### RICHARD
Really! And I’ve been writing a fair amount of my own stuff. 

---

### TED
Now we’re talking. Some jazz? 

---

### RICHARD
Well, I guess not what you’d call traditional jazz or, I don’t know, fusion. I’ve been doing a lot of blues.


---

### TED
Blues? 

---

### RICHARD
The granddaddy of them all! I’ve been doing quite a study on the blues, actually. 

---

I’ve been reading a lot of books. 

---

### TED
Books on the blues? 

---

### RICHARD
Yeah. Do you know Blues Fell This Morning by Paul Oliver? 

---

### TED
No, I can’t say that I do, Rich. 

---

### RICHARD
Wow. It is a great book. You’ve gotta read it, Paul. 

---

### TED
Okey doke. What’s your favourite kind of music? 

---

### RICHARD
I really like all kinds. 

---

### TED
Jazz. Favourite kind of jazz? 

---

### RICHARD
I really like all kinds. Uh, Oscar Peterson, of course. Art Tatum—wow! Chick, and Herbie… 

---

### TED
Why do you want become a jazz musician, Rich? 

---

### RICHARD
Well I feel like I’ve got jazz in my soul. If you can say that white guys have soul. 

---

### TED
Okay. I think I’ve learned a little bit about you.

Diminished seven.

Minor Major Seventh Chord.

### RICHARD
Sorry. Could you play that one again? 

---

### RICHARD
Well, theres a flat five in there and a minor 9 I think… 

---

### TED
We won’t worry about that one. Let me hear you play five against four

Sure, what?

### TED
Well, call me nutty, but how about some jazz? Do you know any standards? 

---

### RICHARD
“My Funny Valentine”? 

---

### TED
Sure, I’d love to hear your crack at “Valentine.” Just one time through if you don’t mind. 

---
template: noise
[RICHARD plays his version of “My Funny Valentine.” It feels very rigid and forced at times. The jazz piece is still pleasant to listen to, but clearly the wrong style]

---

I don’t know how to tell you this without hurting your feelings, 

---

so I’m just going to have to hurt your feelings.

---

I don’t know where you classical guys get off thinking you can come in here 

---

and play a kind of music that is completely outside, above, and beyond your grasp.

---

Just because your mom made you practise some stuff for ten years 

---

does not mean that you can waltz into an institution like this and play jazz, Rich.

---

Jazz, I’m talking. Because you can’t. I got thirteen-year-old kids who’ve never had a lesson, can’t read a note, 

---

they could wipe your white middle-class ass right off the keyboard.

---

You want some good advice? Run, don’t walk, back to classical music. That’s where you belong. 

---

I’ve read your records. You’ve done really well in the thingy—the festival—and got high marks on your exams and that’s great,

---

but it means diddly-squat here. Diddly. You really want to play pop music, do what everyone else does;

---

go out, buy one of those big fat books, The Hundred Greatest Tunes of the Millennium or whatever, 

---

and when your friends are drunk at a party you can play them something from Cats.

---

That’s about it for a guy like you.

---

I know this is brutal, but I want you to understand, Rich, I’m actually doing you a favour here, okay? 

---

And I am sorry, son.

You wanna tell the next kid it’s okay to come in on your way out, I’d appreciate it.

### RICHARD
I had to drive the children all over hell’s half acre and I am feeling a little emotionally raw today. 

---

### TED
I’m very sorry about that, Mrs. Billingsley. 

---

### RICHARD
Oh please, Teddy, call me Marsha. 

---

### TED
What are we looking at this week? 

---

### RICHARD
“In My Little Birch Canoe.” 

---

### TED
Did you finish “Finger Fun”? 

---

### RICHARD
Yes, you see, you actually gave me a gold star last week. 

---

### TED
I think you put that there. 

---

### RICHARD
Oh Teddy.

---

[Richard starts to play. There are quite a few wrong notes]

---

### TED
Whoa. Everybody out of the canoe. Mrs. Billingsley – 

### RICHARD
Ah-ah-ah, Marsha. Marsha. 

---

### TED
What do I say every week? You have got to start remembering or I’m going to—I’m going to… 

---

### RICHARD
What, Teddy? 

### TED
I’m going to lose the will to live. 

---

### RICHARD
Oh Teddy, you’re only seventeen. 

---

### TED
I do but jest. But seriously, there are three things that I say every week.

---

### RICHARD
Curve my fingers! 

### TED
That’s one. 

---

### RICHARD
And lower my wrists! At the same time! 

### TED
That’s two. 

---

### RICHARD
And count out loud while I play!! Oh, silly Marsha! 

---
template: noise
[RICHARD begins to play. His counting is not in time with what he is playing]

---


One bit, two bit, three bit. 

---

[RICHARD stops playing.]

---

 

Oh Teddy, Teddy, do you remember when I was telling you about my friend Peggy? 

---

Yes, you remember! 

---

She’s the one who’s been my best friend ever since high school when we were on the cheerleading squad together.

---

Well, Peggy has been very depressed lately; I think she’s going through the change… 

---
template: noise
[Clock start ticking again]

---

…And so I said to the clerk in that store, “There is no way I am going to pay $69.99 for that blouse!”

---

It was kind of like the one I wore about three weeks ago, Teddy, do you remember, it had a floral pattern… 

---
template: noise
[Clock starts ticking again]

---

…And then, when I was seventeen, just about your age, Teddy, I used to spend hours looking at my father’s fossil collection.

---

I always thought that one day I would be a paleontologist. Isn’t it funny the way life turns out? 

---
template: noise
[Clock starts ticking again]

---

My husband’s having an affair.

[She cries uncontrollably.] 

---

### TED
That’s about all the time we have, Mrs. Billingsley. I’m sorry, there’s someone coming right after you. 

---

### RICHARD
I understand. 

---

### TED
I’m sorry about your troubles. 

### RICHARD
Thank you, Teddy. 

---

### TED
Um, we’ll see you next week, okay? 

---

### RICHARD
It’s the best part of my week. 

---

### TED
Oh, how I wish I could say the same. 

---

[RICHARD sings and plays “Piano Man”  by Billy Joel. Richard changes up the classic tune with his own lyrics] 

---

### RICHARD
It’s a pretty good crowd for a [Current day of the week], and the manager gives me a smile.

---

Cause she knows that it’s me they’ve been coming to see, to forget about life for a while. 

---

And the piano sounds like a carnival, and the microphone smells like a beer, 

---

and they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar and say “man, what are you doing here?” 

---

### TED
[On the phone]
You sell when I tell you to sell, you buy when I tell you to buy—this is not a dialogue, asshole!

---

I’ll have another one of these, dollface, and I mean that politically correctly. Tell starboy to make it a double, will you? 

---

Hey, Paul, Paul, Paul, Paul, Paul, Paul, Paul, PAUL! Oh, sorry, I thought you were Paul. 

---

[RICHARD finishes the song.]

---



Hey, that was great. 

### RICHARD
Thanks. 

---

### TED
How old are you there, little guy? 

---

### RICHARD
Seve… uh… twenty one. 

---

### TED
Yeah right, can I see some ID?

---

Don’t worry, I won’t blow your cover. That was pretty good there, eh? I know music.

---
template: noise
[Ted plays the knuckle-roll song. It's bad] 

---

### RICHARD
Thanks. So, do you have any requests? 

---

### TED
Do you know “Piano Man”? 

---

### RICHARD
I just played it. 

---

### TED
What, in your last set you mean? 

### RICHARD
No. I just played it. 

---

### TED
No you didn’t. 

### RICHARD
Yes I did. 

---

### TED
No you didn’t. 

### RICHARD
Yes I did. 

---

### TED
I was standing right here.

---

### RICHARD
Well, I played it right here. 

### TED
Are you calling me a liar? 

---

### RICHARD
No, I’m not calling you a liar&#8288;— 

---

### TED
You think I don’t know “Piano Man”? You’ll tell me though?! 

---

I was listening to that song before you were born, you little underage smartass.

---

### RICHARD
I’ll tell you though – maybe if you weren’t yelling across the bar to Paul or talking on your cellphone, you make have hear it -

---

### TED
You don’t want to play the goddamn song, that’s fine with me! 

---

Just say, “I’m sorry, sir, but I’d rather not play that particular selection at this juncture.” And we move on! 

---

### RICHARD
Okay, okay. I’ll play it again. 

---

### TED
You’ll play it for the first time. 

---

### RICHARD
Whatever.

---


[Richard begins to play Piano Man]

---

### TED
Hey! HEY!

---

Say it. 

---

[Richard laughs]

You better say it. 

---

### RICHARD
I’ll play it for the first time. 

---

### TED
Goddamn right!

---

template: noise
[RICHARD begins to play.] 

---

Yeah, that’s “Piano Man”! I gotta to take a whiz, kid. Gary! Gary! Sorry, I thought you were Gary… 

---
template: noise
[Richard continues to play Piano Man, increasing in intensity] 

---

### TED
Ricky, Ricky, what you do, eh? 

---

### RICHARD
Oh sorry, Mr. Scarlatti, I was just fooling around. 

---

### TED
That’s-a Billy Joel. 

---

### RICHARD
Mr. Scarlatti. You know Billy Joel?

---

### TED
Yeah. I like-a Billy Joel. He’s a man. He’s a real man. He’s a piano man. 

---

### RICHARD
That’s a good one, Mr. S. 

### TED
Thank you. 

---

### RICHARD
So, how’s your back? 

---

### TED
Not so good, how’s your Bach? 

---

### RICHARD
Not so good. 

---

### TED
[TED makes a rimshot sound before he lies down]
What else have you got for me this week, Ricky? 

---

### RICHARD
Well, believe it or not, I’m still working on the second Chopin Ballade. 

---

### TED
Oh, she’s a pig. 

---

### RICHARD
Oh, yeah. Oh, I’ve got the Schoenberg. 

---

### TED
Oh no, no, no Shoenberg, I’m in the mood for a melody. 

---

### RICHARD
How about the Mozart Fantasia in C Minor? 

---

### TED
Give me the Bach. You play that for my back. 

---

My back likes that one. Take it from the cadenza, Ricky. The B flat. 

---

### RICHARD
Okay. 

---

### TED
Hey, hey, hey. It’s-a good for my back to “be” flat. 

---

### RICHARD
I don’t know where you come up with them, Mr. S. 

---

### TED
It’s a gift.

[RICHARD begins to play in a rush.]

---

Hey, hey, hey. Think before you play, Rambo. Breathe. Start again. 

---
template: noise
[RICHARD plays a segment, then stops.]

---

Ricardo. You play this better three weeks ago. What’s-a matter? 

---

Think before you play. Breathe. Let’s go. Start again. 

---
template: noise
[RICHARD plays one note then stops.]

---

### RICHARD
Mr. Scarlatti, I can’t go on. 

---

I’m seventeen years old. I can’t go on being a piano nerd. 

---

Sitting for hours on end in a room by myself trying to make my fingers do unnatural contortions. 

---

The piano’s become like this millstone around my neck. 

---

I feel guilty when I’m not practising, I feel inadequate when I do.

---

I’m not going anywhere as a classical pianist. You know it, and I know it. 

---

And anyway, how is it relevant? 

---

I want to work to change the world, Mr. Scarlatti. Politically. 

---

How am I going to do that being a classical pianist? 

---

Classical music is this middle-class, European, elitist art form 

---

that is dying in front of an apathetic public that gets more satisfaction playing Nintendo.

---

And acoustic instrumentation is dead. I mean, no offence, Mr. Scarlatti, 

---

but the piano is going the way of the typewriter… or the eight-track cassette.

---

And classical musicians are becoming this smaller and smaller cabal of crazy archaicartisans, 

---

like stonemasons or blacksmiths or something.

---

I mean, we’re weird now, but we’re going to get weirder and weirder as we get fewer and fewer, 

---

until finally we’ll be totally outside of society altogether. Cultural lepers. 

---

I just want you to know that this has nothing to do with you. 

---

I think you’re a great teacher and a great guy.

---

I’ve learned a lot from you… and not just about the piano. 

---

But it’s time for me to move on. Mr. Scarlatti…

---

I’m quitting the piano. 

---

[The finale of Horowitz’s Carnegie Hall performance of the Mephisto Waltz by Liszt plays. It is a beautiful and sweet bit of music]

### RICHARD
Ted. Ted! 

### TED
What? 

---

### RICHARD
Do you want another beer? 

### TED
Yeah, yeah. Shh. This is the part. 

---

### RICHARD
What part? 

### TED
The part I’ve been telling you about! 

---

It sounds like a Ping-Pong ball being dropped. 

---

How does he do that?! Here it comes again. 

---

Ping-Pong ball. 

---

---

Here he goes. Listen to this.

---
template: noise
[The recording comes to a climactic finish, growing in drama and excitement. Ted cheers with the crowd]

---

That, my friend, is one little seventy-five-year-old man, one big black piano, 

---

and two thousand people who would rather be there than anywhere else;

---

whose lives were forever altered on that day, who still say today, “I was there when Vlad played Carnegie Hall.”

---

If you’re not going to play like that what’s the point? 

---

I think that’s why I quit. I knew what I’d have to go through to play like that.

---

What seventeen-year-old kid wants to sit in a little room by himself staring at little black dots, developing hemorrhoids?

---

I was a social kid. I wanted to be out in the world with people, real live people. 

---

Interacting, you know?

---

Now that people are such a big part of my life, I often wish I was in a little room by myself.

---

Stupid thing is, now I know how to work. Now I’ve got discipline. Now I enjoy practising.

---

Now it’s too late. But some little part of me still thinks I could have done it.

---

I could have been a world-class classical musician. I could have played Carnegie Hall. 

---

It’s very important for me to believe that, because if I didn’t believe that, it would mean that

---

I didn’t quit because I wanted a normal life, it’d mean I quit because I wasn’t good enough.

---

Shit, now I’m depressed.

---

### RICHARD
Do you remember the last time we got this drunk together? 

---

### TED
Vaguely. 

---

### RICHARD
Well you put on that same recording of Vladimir Horowitz playing the Mephisto Waltz by Franz Liszt… 

---

### TED
Guilty, my lord. 

---

### RICHARD
…and you made the same fehschtunkineh speech you just did. 

---

### TED
I did not. 

### RICHARD
You did too. 

---

### TED
I did not. 

### RICHARD
You did too. 

---

### TED
Did I really? 

### RICHARD
Yep. 

---

### TED
That’s pathetic. 

### RICHARD
Yep. 

---

### TED
Thanks, now I’m even more depressed. 

---

You know what I’m talking about though, don’t you, Rich? 

---

### RICHARD
Yeah.

---

But you know—we’re not bad piano players. 

### TED
No, we’re not bad. 

---

### RICHARD
We’re okay. 

---

### TED
We’re pretty good. 

### RICHARD
We’re quite good. 

---

### TED
We’re two of the best piano players in the world. 

---

### RICHARD
No, we’re not. 

---

### TED
We’re two of the best piano players in the country? 

---

### RICHARD
No, we’re not. 

---

### TED
We’re two of the best piano players in the city? 

---

### BOTH
No. 

---

### TED
In the neighbourhood? 

### RICHARD
Yes. 

---

### BOTH 
We are two of the best piano players in the neighbourhood.
