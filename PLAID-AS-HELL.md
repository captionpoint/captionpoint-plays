Hello, and welcome to Babes With Blades Theatre Company’s production of “Plaid as Hell”

---

At this time we’d like to ask you to turn off all cellphones & and any personal devices that make noise, 

---

and to unwrap any candy or cough drops. For the health and safety of our audience and actors, 

---

face masks that cover your mouth and nose are required at all times in the theater and during the performance. 

---

If you have a drink in the space, you can take a sip, but please make an effort to remask quickly.

---

We would also like to remind you that the taking of photographs or use of recording devices is strictly prohibited.

---

Also, please note that the actors will be using the aisles during the performance, so if you need to leave your seat for any reason,

please do so carefully, and only the left side of two thirds of the audience if possible.   

---

Finally, we’d like to add that word of mouth is our best advertisement.  

---

If you enjoy the show, please tell your friends either face to face, or via social media.

Thank you and enjoy “Plaid as Hell”.

[“Know Your Name” by Mary Lambert plays]

## EMILIE:
Hey, uh, Cass, you gonna wake your girlfriend up at any point so she can help move some of this shit inside?

---

## CASS:
What? There’s three of us, we can have this done in a jiffy.

---

## EMILIE:
Did you just say ‘jiffy’?

---

## KELLY:
Damn, it’s been a long time since I heard that word.

---

Great word.

---

## EMILIE:
“Jiffy”?

---

## KELLY:
It’s a fantastic word! Sounds like what it means.

---

## EMILIE:
Sounds like my dad.

---

## CASS:
I am your dad now, Emilie, and the sooner you accept that —

---

## EMILIE:
I’m just saying it doesn’t seem fair that Jessica isn’t helping.

---

## CASS:
It’s Jess, you know it’s Jess, and she worked a 24 yesterday.

---

I told her she could stay home and sleep, but she really wanted to come.

---

## EMILIE:
Really?

---

## JESS:
Where should I put this?

---

## CASS:
Hi, babe, we were trying to let you sleep.

---

## EMILIE:
Who brought coconut water?

---

## JESS:	
Um, —	
--

## CASS:
It’s not made with Satan’s cum, ok?

---

## EMILIE:
Tastes like it.

---

## KELLY:
I like coconut water!

---

## EMILIE:	
Keep your voice down. We are in Wisconsin.
--

## CASS:
Thank you, Kelly.

---

## EMILIE:
If I wanted to know what coconut water tastes like, I would just lick my own sweat.

---

## CASS:
Em —

---

## EMILIE:
Actually, if I wanted to know what coconut water tastes like, I would scoop up some seawater with a shell, 

---

carry it around for awhile in the sun until it was lukewarm, spit in it, and then drink that.

---

## CASS:
You have very strong feelings about coconut water for someone who loves eating ass.

---

## EMILIE:
Hey, I’m a woman of many facets. Dimensions. Complexities. Whatever.

---

## CASS:
You contain multitudes, we know.

---

## JESS:
That’s, um, mine, actually.

---

## EMILIE:
Oh.

---

## CASS:
Best behavior. You promised.

---

## KELLY:
How’s residency going?

---

## JESS:
Uh, good! When I’m not utterly sleep-deprived or spiraling through imposter syndrome or thinking about punching Kevin because the attending asked me a question and he talked over me.

---

## CASS:
We hate Kevin

---

## EMILIE:
Jesus, Kelly, what’d you put in here, bricks?

---

## KELLY:
No, books.

---

I’m gonna go grab some more stuff out of the car.

---

## EMILIE:
How many books?

---

## JESS:
Emilie, what do you do?

---

## EMILIE:
Receptionist.

---

## CASS:
Emilie’s a performer.

---

## JESS:
What kind of performance?

---

## CASS:
Burlesque

---

## JESS:
I’d love to see you perform sometime?

---

## EMILIE:
Maybe.

---

## CASS:
Em, c’mon.

---

## EMILIE:
I’ll think about it.

---

## CASS:
You should really see her perform.

---

She blows my mind, every time.

---

She does some really niche stuff, too.

---

## JESS:
Like what?

---

## CASS:
She did a Shego act for Halloween last year that brought down the house.

---

## EMILIE:
I don’t even feel like that’s that niche.

---

## KELLY:
Look live! 

---

## JESS:
Shego from Kim Possible? Oh my god, I had such a crush on her!

---

## KELLY:
Didn’t we all?

---

## EMILIE:
See? That’s not niche.

---

## CASS:
Okay, so I’m the only person who didn’t know who Shego was!

---

## KELLY:
Yeah.The only gay person.

---

## JESS:
You didn’t watch Kim Possible as a kid?

---

## CASS:
My parents didn’t have cable when I was growing up.

---

Saturday morning was for Kumon.

---

## EMILIE:
Right, cuz you were raised in a cult

---

## KELLY:
What kind of cult emphasizes women learning math?

---

## EMILIE:
Fair point.

---

## CASS:
I wan’t “raised in a cult,” my parents just didn’t have cable.

---

## EMILIE:
And you were homeschooled.

---

## CASS:
I was homeschooled for one semester.

---

Kumon was unrelated.

---

## JESS:
What is Kumon?

---

## CASS:
Math worksheets — but, like, special timed ones.

---

And you’d go to someone’s house to do them.

---

## EMILIE:
This sounds like a kidnapping scheme.

---

## CASS:
They changed the rules around the time I quit.

---

You had to be a licensed center.

---

But I did mine in this lady’s basement.

---

## EMILIE:
You went to her BASEMENT? You never told me that part! White people are always doing the most horror-movie shit without a second thought.

---

## CASS:
Yeah, yeah.

---

I’m gonna get Jess’s bag.

---

## JESS:
I guess it’s like going to your piano teacher’s house for lessons.

---

## EMILIE:
Yeah, I was always very excited when my piano teacher let me out of the basement.

---

## JESS:
Oh, do you play piano?

---

## EMILIE:
No.

---

## EMILIE:
Cass, should I be concerned about the clinking noise your girlfriend’s bag is making?

---

## CASS:
Clinking …? 

---

## JESS:
It’s handcuffs! I brought handcuffs.

---

Sorry, everyone.

---

## CASS:
So … what were we talking about?

---

## KELLY:
Piano

---

## CASS:
I wish I’d stuck with piano.

---

## KELLY:
I wish I’d stuck with wrestling.

---

## JESS:
You wrestle?!

---

## KELLY:
I did, for a minute.

---

In high school.

---

I was on the boys’ team because my school didn’t have a girls’ team.

---

My mom threatened to Title 9 their asses; it was very cool.

---

## JESS:
Your mom sounds amazing.

---

## KELLY:
She is.

---

She taught me everything.

---

She was so far ahead of her time.

---

Like, I got actual conversations about consent from her.

---

I mean, they were mostly “punch him in the nuts,” but still.

---

Solid advice.

---

## EMILIE:
Except you ended up liking boys.

---

## KELLY:
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

---

Details.

---

I knew how babies were made! I knew what a period was, when I was, like, nine —

---

## JESS:
Oh my god, I am so jealous.

---

## CASS:
Wait, no one told you about getting your period?

---

## JESS:
No one! I didn’t have an older sister, and I guess my mom didn’t think I’d start that early

---

— I was eleven? Maybe ten? It was before we covered it in school.

---

None of my friends had started. So I thought I was dying.

---

There — this is probably TMI, but I had, like, a chunk? In my first period, there was, like, a clump of the lining, 

---

which it turns out is totally normal but I was like — are my insides falling out?

---

## KELLY:
Wait I have totally had that happen!

---

## JESS:
You have?!

---

## KELLY:
Yes! I — ok, so I was in college.

---

So I was not new to periods or anything.

---

And I was pretty high, because — cramps, so — I literally wrote that off until now as a thing my high brain made up.

---

But that’s a thing?

---

## JESS:
It’s totally a thing! It was — once I understood what it was — I was like, that’s so cool? That bodies do shit like that, and we’re fine? 

---

A lot of my med school classmates have a story like that, like, Shriya’s brother broke his leg when they were little, 

---

and it was an open break, and she wanted to see what was inside before they went to the ER.

---

## CASS:
Oh, god, babe, can we please not talk about open breaks?

---

## FROM THE RADIO:
“… the man is believed to be on foot and likely armed.

---

This is breaking news, and we will provide updates as they become available.

---

Today in Baraboo, a woman was startled by a raccoon who’d climbed through a window and into her child’s bedroom, prompting —”

---

[“Take Me Home, Country Roads” blares out at an impossible volume]

---

## CASS:
TURN IT OFF!

---

## KELLY:
What was that about a man?

---

## CASS:
Who’s down for the lake?

---

## JESS:
You know I’m coming

---

## EMILIE:
Sounds like my first time.

---

## KELLY:
Nice

---

## CASS:
Emilie, you coming?

---

## EMILIE:
Hell no.

---

You cannot pay me enough to get in lake water in the fall.

---

No thank you.

---

## CASS:
It i barely October, and it is definitely still warm out.

---

## KELLY:
Thank you, climate change.

---

## CASS:
C’mon, let’s get our swimsuits on, check out our room.

---

## EMILIE:
Not gonna wait for them?

---

## KELLY:
If they don’t want to get in on this one, they’ll get in on the next one.

---

## EMILIE:
This one’s all ours.

---

“Changing into their swimsuits” was an excuse.

---

## KELLY:
Even though we’re right here?

---

## EMILIE:
Cass is obsessed.

---

If I have to hear one more insinuation of how great the sex is, I will — 

---

## KELLY:
You’ll what?

---

## EMILIE:
I don’t know.

---

Something drastic.

---

Gouge my eyes out with a spoon.

---

## KELLY:
Oedipl.

---

Also won’t solve the fact that you can still hear.

---

[Faint sex sounds start coming from the bedroom]

---

## EMILIE:
Called it!

---

## KELLY:
They can hear you!

---

## EMILIE:
Then they should keep it down.

---


[Sex sounds continue]

---

## KELLY:
I need to get laid.

---

## EMILIE:
Same

---

## KELLY:
Oh, bullshit.

---

How many people are you seeing right now?

---

## EMILIE:
Three.

---

And I totally went over to Cara’s place right before we left.

---

## KELLY:
Fuck you! The last time I got laid was the Obama administration.

---

## EMILIE:
Really?

---

## KELLY:
Unforunately.

---

## EMILIE:
Listen I can totally hook you up.

---

I have —

---

## KELLY:
I would really prefer not to date someone you recently slept with, no offense.

---

## EMILIE:
Are you sure I can’t interest you in a cute librarian? She’s really great with her —

---

## KELLY:
Do you ever think you might be happier being single for a while?

---

## EMILIE:
Why?

---

## KELLY:
You’re just, constantly managing this rotating cast of people you’re talking to, or sleeping with, or sort of seeing.

---

Why not, I dunno, take a break for a little while?

---

## EMILIE:
And be alone with my thoughts? No thank you.

---

And, excuse you, why does a relationship have to be going somewhere? Where am I supposed to be going with all of these people? 

---

Can’t we just be going to bed?

---

## KELLY:
Sure.

---

But you don’t actually give people a chance to go anywhere else.

---

Because you’re still waiting for — 

---

## EMILIE:
This is supposed to be smoking in a cabin weekend.

---

Not Kelly takes over for my therapist in a way more brutal way weekend.

---

[Sex noises intensify]

---

## KELLY:
I just want someone nice, you know.

---

Someone who’ll go on walks with me and my dog.

---

And cuddle.

---

Cuddling is how we’re gonna get through the next four years; I feel this very strongly.

---

## EMILIE:
Well cuffing season’s almost over, so you better hurry.

---

[More sex sounds.]

---

[JESS is coming.]

---

## KELLY:
Oh good they’re wrapping up

---

## EMILIE:
Cass hasn’t come yet.

---

## KELLY:
I don’t want to know how you know that.

---

## EMILIE:
We used to be roommates

---

## KELLY:
Again, didn’t ask

---

[CASS is coming.]

---

## EMILIE:
So Jess isn’t a total pillow princess.

---

## EMILIE:
Seems kind of short.

---

## KELLY:
Wow, I didn’t realize that you were the only person in the world who knew how to have sex right.

---

## EMILIE:
Okay, I —

---

## KELLY:
No, now I totally see it.

---

You are the untouchable sex guru and the sex everyone else is having is wrong, and too short, and totally pillow princess-y.

---

Let us all bow before you, O fearless leader, O goddess of The Sex

---

## EMILIE:
Yes, yes.

---

Bow before me.

---

I like it.

---

## KELLY:
Please.

---

You’re a sub.

---

## EMILIE:
I’m a switch!

---

## KELLY:
And the truth comes out.

---

## EMILIE:
You’re a switch too!

---

## KELLY:
Bitch, please, I am a top in the streets, top in the sheets.

---

## EMILIE:
That’s redundant.

---

## KELLY:
You’re mad cuz you lack this big dick energy.

---

## EMILIE:
Oh, please.

---

## KELLY:
Yeah.

---

Don’t be jealous.

---

Ladies can sense it.

---

## EMILIE:
Uh-huh.

---

## KELLY:
It’s true!

---

## EMILIE:
I promise you.

---

My dick’s bigger than yours.

---

## KELLY:
Sure it is.

---

## EMILIE:
Big strap energy.

---

## KELLY:
OK —

---

## CASS:
We’re going to the lake!

---

## EMILIE:
Why? You’re already wet.

---

## JESS:
Do you want to come?

---

## EMILIE:
No thank you, I am good right here.

---

## CASS:
Kelly?

---

## KELLY:
I’m gonna stay with Emilie.

---

I may come out later.

---

But y’all have fun.

---

## CASS:
Ok.

---

C’mon, Jess.

---


---

## EMILIE:
So, vibrators, then?

---

## KELLY:
Oh yeah.

---

I made several additions to my collection.

---

## EMILIE:
Ooh, like what?

---

## KELLY:
So you know those things that are supposed to like, suction your clit?

---

## EMILIE:
I live in fear of those fuckin’ things.

---

## KELLY:
Do not.

---

Listen, I thought a suction toy sounded like something out of Cosmo sex tips but seriously.

---

Get one.

---

I came in two minutes.

---

## EMILIE:
What?

---

## KELLY:
Start to finish.

---

## EMILIE:
Psh.

---

I can do that with my hand.

---

## KELLY:
No you can’t.

---

## EMILIE:
Hand to god.

---

## KELLY:
God desn’t want that hand.

---

Whatever, don’t get one for you.

---

Get one for the next person whose mind you want to blow.

---

I’m telling you, shit is magical.

---

I got one that looks like a penguin.

---

## EMILIE:
A penguin?

---

## KELLY:
Yeah, it’s black and white and it’s got, like — it’s got like a little bowtie.

---

Here — 

---

## EMILIE:
You took a picture of it?

---

## KELLY:
No, but I can find the thing on the internet.

---

Damn it’s slow out here.

---

There! That.

---

## EMILIE:
No way.

---

## KELLY:
Cute, right?

---

## EMILIE:
No fucking way.

---

## KELLY:
What?

---

## EMILIE:
You let a penguin go down on you?!

---

## KELLY:
Mr. Popper’s and my relationship is special.

---

I don’t need to explain it to you.

---

## EMILIE:
You NAMED it?

---

## KELLY:
Obviously

---

## EMILIE:
I have two words for you: beastiality.

---

## KELLY:
You’ve never named a sex toy?

---

## EMILIE:
Me, personally? No.

---

My last girlfriend did, though.

---

## KELLY:
What — ohh yeahhhhhh

---

## KELLY:
Didn’t she keep that when y’all broke up?

---

## EMILIE:
Yes, she did.

---

That bitch.

---

That was like — that was definitely the first sex toy I bought myself that cost more than a hundred bucks.

---

I can’t believe you remember that; that was years ago.

---

## KELLY:
Alexa right?

---

## EMILIE:
Damn, do you have a timeline of all the people I’ve dated?

---

## KELLY:
No, I remember you making Alexa jokes when you two broke up.

---

Like, “Alexa, set a reminder to find a new girlfriend.”

---




## EMILIE:
Hah! She was … something.

---

## KELLY:
Did she steal it from your drawer?

---

## EMILIE:
No, I left it at hers.

---

It was one of those, like, I brought it with me to her place, we fucked, we fell asleep, 

---

and then we woke up and she had had a dream where I had cheated on her — I hadn’t —- 

---

and I was like, “this is ridiculous; I am not having this argument with you,” 

---

and she was like “BUT WHAT IF YOU DID” —- anyway, at a certain point in this fight about a thing that didn’t even happen

---

I was like, fuck it, I don’t need this, we’re done, and I started grabbing my shit and left.

---

And then I got home and realized it wasn’t in my backpack.

---

## KELLY:
Tragic

---

## EMILIE:
Oh, no, that shit was funny as fuck!

---

## KELLY:
If you need recommendations, I got you.

---

My whole budget is sex toys and weed.

---

## EMILIE:
And rent?

---

## KELLY:
Yeah, sure, that too

---

## EMILIE:
Thanks, but prefer keeping my extensive list of requirements between me and my favorite Early to Bed employee.

---

## KELLY:
The cute one?

---

## EMILIE:
I didn’t say they were cute.

---

## KELLY:
Is it the person with an undercut?

---

## EMILIE:
… Maybe.

---

What of it?

---

## KELLY:
Get their number!

---

## EMILIE:
I don’t wanna hit on people while they’re at work.

---

## KELLY:
No, you’re right.

---

You shouldn’t hit on people at work.

---

What if — like if you’re signing a receipt, and you leave your number at the bottom? 

---

Then if they don’t want to do anything with it, they don’t have to do anything, cuz you’re leaving.

---

## EMILIE:
That’s still hitting on them at work.

---

And also if they don’t text then I can never go back to that store.

---

## KELLY:
I could be your sex toy mule.

---

## EMILIE:
You can smuggle them up your butt.

---

## KELLY:
Ew, no

---

## EMILIE:
Are you on the apps?

---

## KELLY:
No, god, why?

---

## EMILIE:
All I’m saying is, there’s things human beings can do that toys can’t.

---

## KELLY:
Eh, they have toys that can pretty much do everything now.

---

Also, like, all of the apps suck.

---

If I have to see another profile that is apparently of a cute woman I’d like to date

---

and then the last photo is her and her boyfriend and the description is about how they’re looking for a third, I will murder somebody.

---

## EMILIE:
Understandable

---

## KELLY:
And the whole premise of the fucking apps is making a split-second decision about somebody based on how hot they look in a photo.

---

Most photos of myself I’m just like “Yup, that is what I look like.”

---

## EMILIE:
You’re cute as fuck! You’re probably not your type.

---

You know, when you have a type and whenever you see someone who fits that you’re like, mmm.

---

You’re just not your own type.

---

That’s why you can’t see it.

---

## KELLY:
Huh.

---

That’s an … oddly reassuring thought.

---

## EMILIE:
Whereas I am my type.

---

I’d totally fuck me.

---

## KELLY:
Just out of curiosity, how high are you right now?

---

## EMILIE:
Normal amount

---

## KELLY:
And the other thing with dating is, like, I have some experience with women but not a lot of experience with women, 

---

and I don’t know when to bring that up, and then I get in my head about it…

---

## EMILIE:
Don’t!

---

## KELLY:
What?

---

## EMILIE:
Then don’t bring it up.

---

You don’t owe somebody that information.

---

And if they’re going to judge you for it, fuck em.

---

## KELLY:
But what if they can tell?

---

## EMILIE:
They can’t.

---

## KELLY:
You seem very sure and I am curious why you are so sure.

---

## EMILIE:
Kelly.

---

I have been with some very “experienced” people who did not have one single clue what they were doing.

---

Experience means different things to different people anyway! Every person you sleep with is going to be different.

---

Even if you figured out the perfect, exact thing that made one person come every time, that might not work at all for somebody else.

---

You’re gonna start from scratch anyway.

---

## KELLY:
You sound so Zen.

---

## EMILIE:
Sex is the only time my brain shuts up, so it is kinda Zen.

---

## KELLY:
How about now?

---

## EMILIE:
And also now.

---

But seriously, don’t worry about it.

---

If you really want to tell someone, I would tell them after you’ve kissed but before clothes come off.

---

But honestly it doesn’t matter.

---

## KELLY:
So during the STI conversation

---

## EMILIE:
Yeah, just get all the awkward over with at once!

---

## KELLY:
“I got tested three months ago, my left nipple is ticklish, oh and by the way I haven’t slept with that many women”?

---

## EMILIE:
Sure! Why not? If they’re a good person to fuck, they won’t judge you.

---

Judgement is the boner killer.

---

Judgement is the little death that brings total obliteration of horniness.

---

I will allow judgement to pass through me.

---

## KELLY:
I did’t know you’d read Dune!

---

## EMILIE:
Like I said, I contain multitudes.

---


[“Stars 4-Ever” by Robyn plays]

[Birds chirping]

---

## CASS:
Aw, what’s wrong?

---

## JESS:
They hate me!

---

## CASS:
No, they don’t

---

## JESS:
They do, they hate me!

---

## CASS:
They don’t! Kelly likes you.

---

## JESS:
Kelly?

---

## CASS:
Yes! She loves you.

---

## JESS:
I knw Kelly likes me; I’m not really worried about Kelly.

---

I’m worried about Emilie.

---

That’s the whole point! That’s the whole point of this weekend!

---

## CASS:
I think that you’ll be fine, I think that you need to give it a little time, and give her some space.

---

You gotta let her come to you.

---

## JESS:
Am I like doing something wrong? It feels like — am I stepping on toes? I shouldn’t — ugh! 

---

I shouldn’t have fucking slept in the car; she clearly, she clearly has a problem with the fact that I slept in the car.

---

## CASS:
She’s trying to find problems with you, you know what I mean? Forget about her.

---

I’m happy you’re here, and I don’t care if she doesn’t like it.

---

## JESS:
I’m happy to be here! And I’m not trying to mope; I’m sorry.

---

I’m just tired and I really wanted this to go well.

---

## CASS:
Hey.

---

You want to know something? I invited you to come on this weekend because you have an amazing ass.

---
We’ve got a lot more weekend! You’re giving up before you’ve even started.

---

## JESS:
You’re right.

---

It can’t all be bad! The part in our room was pretty great.

---

## CASS:
It was.

---

## JESS:
I could have done without the … commentary.

---

## CASS:
Yeah, that was weird.

---

## JESS:
I’m sorry — I’m trying to stay positive, and I’m just — I’m so tired.

---

## CASS:
Do you want to take a nap?

---

## JESS:
No! No no no no no.

---

If I take a nap, it’ll turn into a whole thing, like ‘Oh, why isn’t Jess helping with the food?’ And ‘Oh, Jess is doing this’ ‘Must be nice’ —

---

## CASS:
I really do think you two have a lot in common, and she’s gonna come around, I’m sure of it.

---

I’m optimistic!

---

## JESS:
You’re cute when you’re optimistic

---

## CASS:
What?

---

## JESS:
I gave you a compliment and you heard it.

---

## CASS:
Hey, we get to spend multiple days together.

---

So that’s pretty cool.

---

## JESS:
It is! It is, and I was so excited — okay I will rally.

---

I’m fun.

---

I can be fun.

---

## CASS:
You’re so fun!

---

## JESS:
I am spontaneous!

---

## CASS:
Let’s not get too crazy

---

## JESS:
I’m boring, aren’t I?

---

## CASS:
What? No! I think you’re the coolest, most exciting person in the world.

---

Which is why … are you okay? What are you thinking?

---

## JESS:
It’s not that I’m thinking; it’s that I’m feeling things and I don’t know what I’m feeling!

---

## CASS:
Do you need a minute? Do you want me to give you some space?

---

## JESS:
No no no, don’t go anywhere, please don’t go anywhere, it’s um … I love you.

---

I don’t just like you; I love you.

---

I … should’ve — It’s very picturesque out here!

---

## CASS:
Gimme a sec, gimme me a sec, gimme a sec

---

## JESS:
You don’t have to say it —

---

## CASS:
But I love you! I love you so much and that’s why I want to say it back, I just needed a second, which already happened, so that’s over now and I love you.

---

## JESS:
Really?

---

## CASS:
Yes, dude!

---

## JESS:
When did you know?

---

## CASS:
Do I have to tell you?

---

## JESS:
No, but I’m going to lose my mind if you don’t tell me.

---

I’m going to go through my memories of every single date we’ve ever had —

---

## CASS:
Do you want to guess?

---

## JESS:
Was it a moment of us being cute and sexy, or —

---

## CASS:
You’re always cute.

---

## JESS:
Or was it, like, something dumb?

---

## CASS:
I think it was — I think it was last month, when I wanted you to watch Shrek with me, and I was so excited, and of course you passed out immediately —

---

## JESS:
I’ve seen that movie a million times!

---

## CASS:
— And you fell asleep on my shoulder and it reminded me of when we met, and I thought, god, her hair smells so good and I love her so much.

---

## JESS:
I should send a thank-you note to the shampoo company.

---

## CASS:
Can I tell you something embarrassing? You left that tiny bottle of your shampoo in my shower and sometimes I smell it cuz it smells like you.

---

Isn’t that creepy?!

---

## JESS:
You know that, um, softball jersey that you love that’s been missing? I have it.

---

## CASS:
Do I smell good?

---

## JESS:
You do smell good.

---

You do.

---

## CASS:
I love you.

---

I just want to say it, like, a million times.

---

## JESS:
I love you.

---
Okay.

---

I feel like I can relax now, and be confident.

---

I know we talked about — like, you and Emilie are in this weird position where you don’t feel the same like, 

---

and I know that’s not the relationship that you want to have, but I don’t know just like seeing it, 

---

seeing her for the first time … she’s got some real feelings in there.

---

## CASS:
Can I ask you a question?

---

## JESS:
Of course

---

## CASS:
Am I a shitty person? Because I feel like I am.

---

Like, just being around her.

---

## JESS:
No, no, no.

---

You’ve been clear.

---

And you clearly love each other as friends, and that is a huge, amazing — if I had a friend like that? I would never.

---

And I’m sure that a lot of the things that I’m seeing, for her, come from a genuine place of friendship.

---

## CASS:
You’e like the most mature person I’ve ever dated in my whole life.

---

I just — I just want to be friends with Emilie, and I feel like I can never just be friends.

---

## JESS:
I’m sure, at some point, you’ll talk about it, <br>and—

---

## CASS:
This weekend?

---

## JESS:
No! Nooooo.

---

Like, after this weekend.

---

You know, maybe Monday?

---

## CASS:
Yeah, hop in the car, be like, ‘Alright, here we go.’

---



## JESS:
I mean, I see how that would be a difficult conversation to have, and she’s been avoiding it by refusing to come within 20 feet of me … 

---

and now, she’s met me, and I’m gonna charm her, I am.

---

## CASS:
I love this side of you

---

## JESS:
Your love is fueling me.

---

I’m gonna do good, and like, come Monday, she’s going to see.

---

## CASS:
I just don’t want you to blame yourself.

---

Because I know you’re going to do that.

---

This shit isn’t your shit; it’s her shit, and it’s mine.

---

And I don’t want you to feel like it’s your fault.

---
You’re doing nothing wrong.

---

You’re perfect.

---

## JESS:
I’m mature? You’re mature!

---

## CASS:
Wow! Look at us being so mature

---

## JESS:
It’s very hard for me to picture myself as mature, when like, yesterday I was in the sex toy store with the handcuffs, like “What do I do with these?”

---

## CASS:
Oh my god, we are never going to hear the end of it about those fucking handcuffs.

---

Also why are they metal?! Did you bring more sex stuff? I’m terrified to look in your bag.

---

## JESS:
Um, I brought a lot of stuff.

---

Now I’m realizing that most of it is going to stay in the bag because the walls are thin.

---

I like it out here, though.

---

## CASS:
There’s bugs!

---

## JESS:
They live here! We’re in their space.

---

(imitating Shrek) What are you doing in my swamp!

---

## CASS:
You wanna do Shrek roleplay?

---

## JESS:
Can I be the dragon?

---

## CASS:
Doesthat mean I’m the donkey? We’re gonna make fucked-up, dragon/donkey babies?

---

## JESS:
Sure, Shrek roleplay this weekend, talk to Emilie on Monday.

---

[EMILIE and KELLY chatting]

---

## CASS:
It is freezing!

---

## EMILIE:
Jesus, you scared the shit out of me!

---

## CASS:
I think my lips are turning blue.

---

Are they?

---

## JESS:
They’re fine.

---



---

## EMILIE:
Get a room!

---

## KELLY:
You want hot tea?

---

## EMILIE:
Does this place even have a kettle?

---

## KELLY:
We can find out.

---

## JESS:
Uh, sure, if we’ve got something.

---

## CASS:
I’ll help.

---

---


[CASS makes a horror movie screech noise]


---

## EMILIE:
What the fuck, Cass?! Where’d you even find that?

---

## CASS:
In the kitchen!

---

## EMILIE:
Who keeps an axe in the kitchen?

---

## JESS:
If you were going out the back door to chop wood, maybe?

---

## KELLY:
There’s more shit in there, too.

---

Like garage stuff.

---

Dad stuff.

---

That doesn’t belong in the kitchen.

---

No teakettle, though, sorry.

---

If you want a hammer or a baseball bat, though, I’ve got you covered.

---

## EMILIE:
Who owns this place? These freaks keep an axe in their kitchen?

---

## CASS:
I dunno.

---

It was on AirBnB right by the lake and it wasn’t expensive.

---

Key was under the mat like they said.

---

## EMILIE:
Let me get this really, really clear — how much do you know about the people who own this cabin we’re spending the night in?

---

## CASS:
Uh, I messaged them on AirBnB and they were cool? I saw a photo?

---

## EMILIE:
What did they look like?

---

## CASS:
They looked like a nice, normal couple.

---

## EMILIE:
This is like the cabin from Evil Dead.

---

I bet you any money this place is fucking haunted.

---

## CASS:
By who? No one lives here.

---

## EMILIE:
The ghosts of all the people that nice couple has axe-murdered in the kitchen and buried in the basement.

---

## CASS:
What basement?

---

## EMILIE:
Exactly.

---

## CASS:
Whatever.

---

We should start making dinner.

---

 C’mon, dragon.

---

## JESS:
Dragon?

---

## CASS:
You know …

---

## JESS:
Oh!

---

## EMILIE:
I’m going to go get some beer.

---

## CASS:
Okay.<!-- .slide: data-fullscreen -->

---

Kelly and I can handle dinner if you want to take a nap.

---

## JESS:
That would be amazing.

---

Wake me up when it’s ready?

---

## CASS:
Of course 

---

## KELLY:
C’mon, there’s a frozen pizza around here somewhere.

---

The oven works, right?

---

## CASS:
It said it did on the site.

---

## KELLY:
Is it DiGiorno?

---

## CASS:
Uh, I don’t remember what we got.

---

I think it was from Trader Joe’s.

---

## KELLY:
DiGiorno is the gold standard but as long as it’s not made with cauliflower crust, I will eat it.

---

This is an equal-opportunity mouth.

---

## CASS:
What’s wrong with cauliflower crust?

---

## KELLY:
Cauliflower masquerading as carbs must stop.

---

It is a travesty.

---

As if we haven’t all suffered enough this past year.

---

## CASS:
It’s gluten free.

---

## KELLY:
I want gluten.

---

I want it.

---

I want bread.

---

Bread with cheese on it.

---

Cheesy bread.

---

## CASS:
Good, cuz we also brought one of those terrifying loaves of frozen Texas toast with some unholy butter-like substance on it.

---

## KELLY:
Ugh, you’re the best.

---

## CASS:
Hey, um, I have to tell you something.

---

## KELLY:
Ooh, I sense a secret.

---

Tell me tell me tell me.

---

## CASS:
I told Jess I love her.

---

Well, actually, she told me she loved me first.

---

But then I told her.

---

So yeah.

---

## KELLY:
Eeeee! Dude, I am so proud of you! And happy for you! Damn, look at you.

---

In a whole-ass, healthy relationship with the woman you love.

---

## CASS:
It’s pretty great.

---

## KELLY:
You told me like a month ago you thought you loved her.

---

What took you so long?

---

## CASS:
I dunno, I was nervous! I wanted to be sure!

---

## KELLY:
You must’ve been pretty sure if you were bringing her on this trip.

---

## CASS:
I’ve been trying to get Emilie to meet her since we started dating!

---

## KELLY:
I know, but you decided to do it this way, so Emilie’s going to be annoyed, and you’re going to have to ignore her until she cools off.

---

## CASS:
I can’t!

---

## KELLY:
I love Emilie, but she’s trying to get a rise out of you.

---

If you don’t give her one, if you just act confident in your relationship with Jess, she’ll get over it.

---

## CASS:
I just want them to like each other.

---

## KELLY:
You’re asking for a lot, there, Cass.

---

You know that, right? I’m not saying either of you is right or wrong.

---

I’ve just been in both of your shoes.

---

## CASS:
What did you do when you were me?

---

## KELLY:
I plowed on through.

---

I was basically like, “This is who I’m dating now, get used to it.” 

---

I let Jacob know he could hang out with us if he wanted, or not.

---

I saw less of him for a while.

---

But then we were good.

---

## CASS:
Yeah, but Jacob was your ex.

---

It’s never been like that!

---

## KELLY:
It’s never been like that for you.

---

Try to cut her some slack.

---

Like, it sucks.

---

## CASS:
She is making it suck!

---

## KELLY:
It’s hard not to do that, when you’re hurt.

---

## CASS:
She’s taking it out on Jess.

---

That’s not fair.

---

## KELLY:
Yeah, shit isn’t fair.

---

## CASS:
Jess isn’t the reason I don’t — feel the same way.

---

What did you do when you were Emilie?

---

## KELLY:
Moped.

---

Stayed away until I felt better.

---

But I’m less confrontational than either of you are.

---

I think you two are gonna have to duke it out.

---

## CASS:
I don’t want to fight about it! Especially not this weekend.

---

And bringing it up just to tell Emilie I don’t feel the same seems like a dick move.

---

What do I do?

---

## KELLY:
Here’s my advice: you’re a garbo can, Emilie’s a garbo can, and I’m tired of talking about this.

---

## CASS:
Fine

---

## KELLY:
Fine

---

---


## CASS:
I’m sorry

---

## KELLY:
For?

---

## CASS:
Putting you in the middle

---

## KELLY:
And?

---

## CASS:
Constantly asking for your advice about this and then ignoring it?

---

## KELLY:
Correct

---

## CASS:
And you’re a really good friend and I promise it won’t happen again.

---

## KELLY:
Look at that! She’s learning!

---

## CASS:
Shut up

---

## KELLY:
I feel like such a proud mom right now

---

## CASS:
Thanks, Mom

---

## KELLY:
Now go clean your room

---

## CASS:
No!

---

## KELLY:
Sh!


[Rain in the background]

---

## CASS:
Shit, did I wake you up?

---

## JESS:
It’s okay.

---

Is Emilie back yet?

---

## KELLY:
Not yet

---

[All phones buzz a loud emergency alert]

---

## CASS:
Flash flood warning.

---

## KELLY:
Ooh, we’re supposed to get some nasty weather tonight.

---

Heavy thunderstorms in 3, 2…
		
---

[Thunderclap]

---

## KELLY:
I am  god.

---

## KELLY:
How’d it go?

---

## EMILIE:
Success! I got beer.

---

[Rustle from outside]

---

## CASS:
Kelly, you ok?

---

## KELLY:
Yeah … I thought I saw — nevermind.

---

## CASS:
You sure?

---

## KELLY:
Yeah

---

## EMILIE:
Please tell me t here’s pizza in the oven because I am starving.

[“disco tits” by Tove Lo]

[Rolling thunder and rain]

---

## EMILIE:
There.

---

If I do say so myself, that is a cozy-ass fire.

---

Girl Scouts taught me one whole life skill.

---

## CASS:
Besides selling cookies

---

## EMILIE:
That, too.

---

## KELLY:
Y’all, I don’t want to freak anybody out, but I am seeing a bunch of news alerts about a spree killer.

---

I think that might’ve been what we caught on the radio, too.

---

## EMILIE:
Spree killer? Is that a thing?

---

## KELLY:
He’s killed two people — apparently he tried to kill a third but she escaped.

---

## EMILIE:
Well, that’s good.

---

## KELLY:
The last place he was spotted was that gas station where your ass went to get that terrible beer, Emilie.

---

## EMILIE:
I’m sorry, I didn’t realize we were suddenly a craft-only household.

---

## KELLY:
I didn’t think I had to tell you.

---

## JESS:
How far was that? The gas station?

---

## EMILIE:
Five miles.

---

Jesus.

---

## CASS:
Wait, what is the difference between a spree killer and a serial killer?

---

## KELLY:
Serial you have to kill three or more.

---

Spree is two.

---

It’s like an over-under thing.

---

## CASS:
You really listen to too many of those murder podcasts.

---

## EMILIE:
It has nothing to do with speed? That’s deceptive.

---

## KELLY:
No.

---

And I do not.

---

My Favorite Murder is a classic.

---

A cult favorite.

---

The pièce de esistance of our entertainment age.

---

## EMILIE:
Seriously, who knows that though? Spree killer being its own thing?

---

## CASS:
Let’s hope he’s not going for serial

---

## KELLY:
Wait, Jess, you’re a doctor.

---

## JESS:
Yes?

---

## KELLY:
That means you’d make a really good murderer.

---

The best murderers are all doctors cuz they know all these ways to kill people and then how to take apart bodies.

---

## JESS:
Um, thanks?

---

## KELLY:
Transferable skills.

---

## JESS:
How’d he kill them?

---

## KELLY:
Uh, they were both women.

---

Looks like they were strangled to death.

---

Yeesh.

---

## CASS:
Was he trying to rob them?

---

## KELLY:
Doesnt look like it.

---

The bodies still had all their valuables on them — wallets, rings, car keys, that kind of stuff.

---

## EMILIE:
The hell …

---

## JESS:
The motive doesn’t have to be robbery.

---

Is there a medical examiner’s report? Were there indications the women were assaulted?

---

## KELLY:
Uh … it looks like one was and the other they aren’t sure.

---

## CASS:
God …

---

## KELLY:
Oh — nope, they found, um, semen on the other woman.

---

So yes, presumably both.

---

## EMILIE:
So they have the guy’s DNA.

---

## KELLY:
Yeah, I would assume.

---

## EMILIE:
So this guy is dead if they find him.

---

## JESS:
Does Wisconsin have the death penalty?

---

## CASS:
No, hey abolished it in 1853.

---

They were one of the earliest states to abolish it, and Wisconsin is the only state that has had only one execution in its history.

---

## CASS:
I listen to All Things Considered.

---

## EMILIE:
Were the women — ?

---

## KELLY:
White.

---

Both white.

---

## EMILIE:
So the police do care.

---

## KELLY:
Guess so.

---

## EMILIE:
And the killer is … ?

---

## KELLY:
They’re not sure.

---

The footage they have of him, he’s wearing a balaclava and gloves, and his face is in shadow.

---

Here, look.

---

It’s super-grainy.

---

## EMILIE:
Yeah I have to say I honestly can’t tell.

---

## JESS:
He looks white to me.

---

## CASS:
His walk is weird.

---

## KELLY:
Yeah.

---

Super bouncy.

---

## EMILIE:
I’m sure murdering women really puts a spring in your step.

---

## CASS:
Ok.

---

Let’s — put our phones away and try to have a fun night.

---

Right? The police are out there.

---

They’re taking care of it.

---

It’s Friday! We have the whole weekend! Who wants to play a drinking game?

---

## KELLY:
Pizza box game.

---

## EMILIE:
Oh my god, yesss.

---

Pizza box game! We haven’t done that in such a long time!

---

## JESS:
What’s the pizza box game?

---

## CASS:
It’s this thing Emilie came up with in college.

---

You have a pizza box — or any cardboard, doesn’t matter — and you draw a shape for each person’s name.

---

And then you take turns flipping quarters into the box.

---

If a quarter lands on somebody’s shape, that person drinks.

---

If it lands in a blank space, the person who flipped it can draw a new space, and make a rule for that space.

---

## KELLY:
Like, truth or dare the person to your left.

---

## EMILIE:
Remove an article of clothing.

---

## CASS:
Speak only in a French accent for ten minutes.

---

Anything you want, really.

---

## JESS:
Are there any limits on rules?

---

## EMILIE:
Like what?

---

## JESS:
Anything that’s off-limits? Anything you guys don’t do?

---

## CASS:
We’re pretty lenient about letting people chicken out of a rule if they don’t want to do it.

---

But you can put pretty much whatever on there.

---

## EMILIE:
Let’s start!

---

## CASS:
Do we have cardboard?

---

## KELLY:
We hae the beer case.

---

We can flatten that out.

---

## EMILIE:
I got it.

---

## KELLY:
Jess, have you ever been to Wisconsin?

---

## JESS:
Uh, only to the cheese castle.

---

## KELLY:
CHEESE CASTLE!

---

## CASS:
HELL IS REAL!

---

## JESS:
… what?

---

## CASS:
You know those two road signs by the … ? By the cheese barn? One says “Hell is Real” really big, and it’s black? Nevermind.

---

## KELLY:
So you went to the cheese castle…

---

## JESS:
Yeah, some of the other residents really wanted to go, so I came with.

---

## KELLY:
Where’s your residency again?

---

## JESS:
U Chicago.

---

## KELLY:
Damn.

---

Was that your top choice?

---

## JESS:
Yeah.

---

I went to UIUC for undergrad cuz it was cheap, and Northwestern for med school, which was, uh, NOT.

---

But it’s a good program, and after my mom got diagnosed I didn’t want to be far away if something happened.

---

## KELLY:
I’m sorry about your mom.

---

Is she okay?

---

## JESS:
Um, it’s a chronic thing, so the management is really important.

---

She’s okay right now.

---

It sort of depends on the month, though.

---

## KELLY:
Is your mom why you went into medicine?

---

## JESS:
Um, kind of.

---

Like, in the other direction, though.

---

She wanted me to.

---

I mean, I do want to help people! Sometimes this just seems like the hardest, worst way with the most student loans to do it, though.

---

## CASS:
Does anybody really think any of us will pay off our student loans?

---

## KELLY:
I know I personally am planning to drown my sorrows in avocado.

---

## CASS:
I wasn’t under the impression you could drink an avocado.

---

## KELLY:
Who said anything about drinking? I am going to bathe in avocado.

---

I am going to motorboat an avocado.

---

I am going to dive face first —-

---

## EMILIE:
Sounds like my first time.

---

Who’s ready to play?

---

## JESS:
Me!

---

## EMILIE:
Draw a shape.

---

## KELLY:
It’s a cat!!! Aw, it’s sleeping! Omg so cute!

---

## JESS:
Uh, it’s a stethoscope.

---

## KELLY:
OH

---

## JESS:
I’m sorry

---

## KELLY:
It’s okay

---

## EMILIE:
Kelly.

---

Draw.

---

 Aww, a heart.

---

That’s adorable.

---

## KELLY:
I just love you all so much.

---

## EMILIE:
Cass?

---

## CASS:
I’m drawing titties, cuz I know that’s what you want to see, Emilie.

---

## EMILIE:
Show me the titties!

---

## CASS:
All you, Emilie.

---

Is that a butt?

---

## EMILIE:
You know it.

---

And you can tell it apart from your titties because it doesn’t have what? Nipples.

---

That’s right.

---

Alright Jess, as the guest of honor you can go first.

---

## EMILIE:
Kelly?

---

## KELLY:
Let’s do this.

---

 New space.

---

Truth or dare the person to your left.

---

## CASS:
Ooo

---

## KELLY:
You’re up.

---

## EMILIE:
Ope, that’s you, Cass.

---

Drink.

---

## EMILIE:
Drink, drink, drink! Your turn.

---

## CASS:
Alright! New square.

---

Kiss a person of your choice.

---

## EMILIE:
That is a stupid square.

---

## CASS:
No, it’s fun!

---

## EMILIE:
You two have kissing people and Kelly and I are kiss-less.

---

## CASS:
Y’all can make out; we’ll watch.

---

## EMILIE:
You can kiss my ass.

---

## CASS:
If you don’t want to do it, don’t do it.

---

## EMILIE:
That sucks all the fucking fun out of the game.

---

## CASS:
So kiss Kelly.

---

My god.

---

## EMILIE:
You better be a good kisser.

---

## KELLY:
Oh, I better be a good kisser?

---

## EMILIE:
I am a great kisser.

---

## KELLY:
Okay, it’s fuckin on.

---

## CASS:
Back to you, Jess.

---

## JESS:
Uhh, new square.

---

Speak in an accent.

---

## CASS:
How long?

---

## JESS:
Sixty seconds.

---

## CASS:
Ok.

---

Kelly, go.

---

## KELLY:
Damn, also a new space.

---

Ooh ooh ooh! Name your big three.

---

## JESS:
Big three?

---

## CASS:
Zodiac signs.

---

## KELLY:
Sun, moon, and rising.

---

## JESS:
What if I don’t know them?

---

## KELLY:
Do you know your sun sign at least? Everybody knows their sun sign.

---

## JESS:
Maybe?

---

## CASS:
I’ll look it up for you.

---

## KELLY:
You hadn’t done that already? How do you know if you’re compatible?

---

## CASS:
I just do.

---

## EMILIE:
My turn!  Okay, I have to drink, but I also want to make a rule.

---

## KELLY:
Go for it.

---

## EMILIE:
Alright, this square is: do a ten-second burlesque number.

---

## KELLY:
Noice! Your, turn Cass.

---

## CASS:
Go, Jess, go!

---

## JESS:
New space! Uhh, sing your go-to karaoke song.

---


---

## EMILIE:
Kelly, it’s your turn.

---

Please hit that square so we can relive our greatest accomplishment as a friend group.

---

## KELLY:
I will do my best.

---

 Aw, fuck.

---

What accent am I using? 

---
template: overlap
## JESS:	
Russian!

## EMILIE
Japanese!


---

## KELLY:
That’ racist.

---

I’m speaking in a Russian accent.

---

One minute.

---

Someone set a timer?

---

## JESS:
I got it.

---

## CASS:
Let’s hear it!

---

## KELLY:
In Russian accent: I haf been making all decision for the US government vor many many months and I am tired and vould like hamberder.

---

## CASS:
Too real.

---

Moving on!

---

## EMILIE:
Ah fuck I’m drinking.

---

## CASS:
Me me me me me.

---

Jess, drink!

---

## JESS:
Okay, me.

---

Uhhh Kelly, drink!

---

## KELLY:
In Russian accent:  Motherfucker.

---

Emilie.

---

## EMILIE:
What

---

## KELLY:
In Russian accent: Ve haf to touch mouths.

---

## EMILIE:
Can I at least start getting high again first?

---

## KELLY:
(no accent) Yeah, I’ll wait.

---

---

---



## CASS:
Ahem.

---

You can stop now.

---

I think I aged five years waiting for that to happen.

---

## KELLY:
That was hot.

---

## EMILIE:
I know.

---

Alright alright alright.

---

Me.

---

Uh I got nothing.

---

It’s gonna be Simba, to the right.

---

## JESS:
Simba?

---

## EMILIE:
Siiiimbaaaa.

---

## CASS:
Jess, kiiiiss me.

---

## KELLY:
Y’all, for real.

---

We get it.

---

You fuck.

---

## CASS:
Good, good.

---

I’m glad you got that.

---

## JESS:
New space! Uh, favorite, um, favorite bone in the body.

---

## CASS:
What?

---

## KELLY:
I don’t know if I can even name one bone.

---

Teeth? Skull? Humerus? Is that a bone? I’m gonna go with teeth.

---

Whose turn is it? Is it mine?

---
template: overlap
## EMILIE:	
Yes	


## CASS:
Yes

---

## KELLY:
Alright, this one is gonna be … worst kiss.

---

## JESS:
Like, do the worst kiss?

---

## KELLY:
Oh go no.

---

Tell us the story of your worst kiss.

---

## EMILIE:
Oh, I am gonna crush that square.

---

## CASS:
Wanna bet?

---

## EMILIE:
Absolutely.

---

I bet you five dollars the worst kiss I’ve experienced is worse than yours.

---

## CASS:
Uh, I have heard about all of the people you have kissed, and you’re on!

---

---



## JESS:
How do you remember all that?

---

## CASS:
We’ve been doing it since we were twelve.

---

That’s the secret.

---

## EMILIE:
I’m pretty sure it’s changed

---

## CASS:
No it hasn’t.

---

It would never.

---

## KELLY:
There was definitely a jump in there a year ago.

---

Emilie, it’s your turn.

---

## EMILIE:
Cass, oh.

---

## CASS:
Alright, let’s see here.

---

Okay, big three.

---

I’m a Cancer sun, Aries moon, Libra rising.

---

## KELLY:
What’s Jess?

---

## CASS:
Capricorn.

---

## KELLY:
Oh, that makes so much sense.

---

## JESS:
Are we compatible?

---

## KELLY:
I’d have to know the rest of your chart.

---

Oooh, can I do your chart sometime this weekend?

---

## JESS:
Sure, I guess.

---

Kelly, drink!

---

## KELLY:
Okay.

---

 And now it’s me.

---

New space! Celebrity impression.

---

Emilie, go.

---


---

## CASS:
My turn!

---

## EMILIE:
Oh, no I didn’t land on my square.

---

That drink was preparatory.

---

I landed on “ten-second burlesque number.”

---



---

## KELLY:
Oh oh! I got it.

---

The usual, Your Highness? 

---

[“Womanizer” by Britney Spears plays]

---

## KELLY:
Why’re you stopping?!

---

## EMILIE:
It was ten seconds! That’s all you get!

---

## KELLY:
Tease

---

## EMILIE:
If I’m going to do more, I need to see some tips.

---

## KELLY:
Damn, I didn’t bring any cash.

---

[There is noise, out in the woods.]

---

## KELLY:
What was that?

---

## CASS:
What was what?

---

## KELLY:
Nothing… I thought I heard

---

## EMILIE:
The rain?

---

## JESS:
No…

---

## CASS:
Baby, it’s just the storm, okay? We’re fine in here.

---

## EMILIE:
Yeah, and if anybody comes anywhere near the cabin we’ll pull a Kelly’s mom and throw some plates at them.

---

## JESS:
What?

---

## CASS:
I didn’t tell you that story? C’mon, I must’ve told you that story.

---

## EMILIE:
Kelly’s mom has mastered the art of self-defense through crockery.

---

## KELLY:
Crockery?

---

## EMILIE:
You were allowed to get excited about jiffy.

---

## JESS:
What happened?

---

## CASS:
She came out.

---

## KELLY:
I didn’t do a good job leading into it.

---

She, uh, threw a plate at me.

---

Unintentionally.

---

## JESS:
A plate?

---

## KELLY:
Threw is a strong word — she turned around really fast; she was holding a plate, which was slippery — 

---

she was doing the dishes — and it flew, truly, like a frisbee, dead at me


---

## EMILIE:
Almost took your teeth out!

---

## CASS:
Your favorite bones!

---

## KELLY:
I ducked it.

---

And I thought she was going to be the easy one

---

## KELLY:
After she cleaned up the plate bits she hugged me and told me she loved me.

---

She wanted to know if boys were completely off the table.

---

I told her no.

---

## JESS:
Cass said there was a party?

---

## KELLY:
Oh, when I came out? Yeah, after I texted Cass and Emilie they broke into my apartment 

---

and when I got home they were hiding in my kitchen with all the lights off, and they’d made these banners that said, 

---

“Jean jacket or leather jacket?” “Docs or Converse?” “Finger guns or thumbs-up?”

---

## EMILIE:
Cat emoji or eggplant emoji!

---

## KELLY:
I still have that one!

---

## EMILIE:
I know!

---

## JESS:
This was recently?

---

## KELLY:
Yeah, a couple years ago.

---

## JESS:
Oh, wow, that’s so great.

---

I, um.

---

I am actually not out to my parents.

---

It’s … I haven’t been out to myself for very long? This is my first, um, queer relationship.

---

I feel like I am recalibrating my sense of self? And I’m not sure I’m ready to share that.

---

## KELLY:
I totally get that.

---

And, you don’t have to come out to anyone if you don’t want to.

---

## JESS:
I do want to.

---

To my mom especially.

---

It’s just … I don’t have any siblings, family is so important to her…

---

## KELLY:
Is it the grandkids thing?

---

## JESS:
It’s more, like, I’m supposed to live for them.

---

Like, my boy cousins can mess around and do whatever they want; it’ll always be fine.

---

But for me … school is an investment, so I can be financially secure and help take care of them when they’re older.

---

I don’t get to live my life for me.

---

Not like, doing what I’m supposed to do, as far as marrying some guy, and like, 

---

yeah, having grandbabies, that feels … I don’t know, selfish?

---

## KELLY:
It’s not selfish, though.

---

It’s what’s right for you.

---

And I’m sure, deep down, they want you to be happy, even if they have a different idea of what happiness looks like.

---

## JESS:
Thanks.

---

I know they do.

---

But … there’s this part of me that is like, what if they tell me I’m wrong, and they’re right? Like, I know that doesn’t make sense…

---

## EMILIE:
No, it does

---

## JESS:
What did your parents do?

---

## EMILIE:
Uh, they were basically like, “No, you’re not.”

---


---

## JESS:
Oh

---

## EMILIE:
I was thirteen.

---

I think their attitude was, well, you’re too young to know.

---

Like, maybe you think you are now, but you haven’t really thought this through.

---

From a loving place, for sure, but like, the vibe was very much: 

---

when it turns out this thing you think is cute and fun is actually kinda hard, you’ll give up.

---

## JESS:
You don’t seem like a giving-up type of person.

---

## EMILIE:
Yeah, you don’t either.

---

## JESS:
I take that as compliment

---

## EMILIE:
Yeah, I meant it as one
---
Anyway I got older, and they were kinda “Well, I guess that’s not going away.”

---

They’ve gotten better about it.

---

They ask me about who I’m dating.

---

## CASS:
People come around

---

## EMILIE:
Not always

---

## CASS:
Sure.

---

But if you’re withholding information, then people don’t actually get the chance to accept you.

---

## EMILIE:
Yeah but if you know they’re not going to accept you, then why give them the chance to be shitty, you know? 

---

Like I’m not saying my parents are shitty – I love my parents.

---

But I’m saying Jess might want to look out for herself instead of worrying about whether her parents are, like, entitled to the information.





---

## CASS:
I never said they were entitled to it

---

## KELLY:
Cass.

---

## CASS:
I said it might be really great, you don’t know!

---

## EMILIE:
Jess knows her family better than you.

---

Okay?

---

## CASS:
Okay

---

## KELLY:
Whose turn were we on?

---

## CASS:
I think it was mine.

---

Celebrity impression! Yes! Is there a time limit?

---

## KELLY:
I forgot to put one, so as long as you like!

---

## CASS:
I’m going to do my Cher impression

---

## KELLY:
Ah! Classic
---

[CASS does her impression.]

---

Applause.

---

## CASS:
Thank you, thank you.

---

I’m here all week.

---

Back to you, Jess.

---

## KELLY:
Okay, okay.

---

Worst kiss story.

---

I’ll start.

---

So I went on a date with this guy who is an <br>actor—

---

## EMILIE:
Already a no.

---

## KELLY:
No interrupting! We were in college, is important context, so maybe he’s better than this now —

---

## EMILIE:
Doubt it

---

## KELLY:
Anyway, he invites me over to smoke at his dorm, or whatever, 

---

and partway through the night I’m like, what is the vibe here because I am not sure, and he’s like, I think it’s like this, 

---

and he kisses me, and it is going well, and then he tries to move on to French kissing —

---

## CASS:
Uh oh

---

## KELLY:
Exactly.

---

And he starts, like, biting my face.

---

Like, he starts — I don’t want to demonstrate on anybody, but it is very difficult to describe — 

---

like, he is opening his whole mouth wide enough to cover my whole mouth

---

## EMILIE:
Why?

---

## KELLY:
And he is moving his whole open mouth onto — over! — my whole mouth teeth-first.

---

## EMILIE:
So biting

---

## KELLY:
Not, ike, fun biting like a little lower lip bite, like full-on, teeth around the outsides of my mouth biting.

---

And he’s just jamming his face into my face.

---
template: overlap
## CASS:	
What	

## EMILIE:
Again, why

---

## JESS:
Did he think that’s how people kiss?

---

## KELLY:
I could not tell you.

---

## CASS:
What did you do?

---

## KELLY:
Uh, I got my hand in his hair and I pulled.

---

And I just pulled his head back until his teeth were like, out of range but our lips were still touching.

---

## EMILIE:
He didn’t say anything?

---

## KELLY:
Nope! He kept kissing.

---

I was pulling really hard, too; I feel kind of bad about it.

---

But he did not seem to notice, like, at all.

---

## EMILIE:
So he was very into hair-pulling.

---

## KELLY:
I guess!

---

## CASS:
Did you see him again?

---

## KELLY:
Uh, we ended up sleeping together, actually.

---
How have we not heard this story before?

---

## KELLY:
Um, it’s not exactly my proudest moment!

---

## CASS:
I don’t know if I could sleep with someone who was that bad of a kisser.

---

Was he good in bed?

---

## KELLY:
Surprisingly, yes.

---

## EMILIE:
I am shook!

---

## KELLY:
Anyway, that’s my worst kiss.

---

## CASS:
That was a journey.

---

## EMILIE:
It certainly was.

---

Okay, well it is my turn, and KARAOKE SONG!!! 

---

[EMILIE starts singing “Wannabe” by The Spice Girls.]

---

## JESS:
That was amazing!

---

## KELLY:
That was how I met these two fools!

---

## JESS:
Really?

---

## KELLY:
Really! They got up to do it at karaoke and there was another mic and I literally ran up and I was like “I’m Sporty!” And then we did it!

---

## CASS:
Been friends ever since

---

## EMILIE:
Your turn, Cass.

---


---

## CASS:
Jess?

---

## JESS:
Truth or dare the person to your left.

---

Cass! Cass, I dare you — to go outside.

---

[Onimous thunder]

---

## KELLY:
Spooooooky!

---

## CASS:
How far outside?

---

## JESS:
Right outside the door is fine.

---

You don’t have to get soaking wet.

---

## EMILIE:
Sounds like —

---

## CASS:
Okay
---

[Storm intensifies]

---

## EMILIE:
Cass, this is stupid.

---

Pick a different dare.

---

## CASS:
Count to ten and lemme back in, ok?

---

## JESS:
Ok.

---

## JESS:
1 … 2 … 3 … 4 … 5 … 6 

---


[Rustling from outside]

… 7 … 8 … 9 … 10!

---

## JESS:
Cass? Cass!

---

## KELLY:
Where is she?

---

## EMILIE:
Cass, this isn’t funny! Come around the side of the cabin or whatever.

---

Ha ha, you’re totally murdered.

---

## JESS:
Cass!

---

## EMILIE:
C’mon, we’ll walk around the cabin.

---

Get your shoes on.

---

Jess, come on.

---

[EMILIE, KELLY, and JESS call for Cass ]

---

## EMILIE:
Fuck.

---

We’ve got to go find her.

---

## KELLY:
These woods are totally fucking haunted.

---

## JESS:
Let’s get the shit from the kitchen — at least then we’ll be sort of armed.

---

## KELLY:
Good idea.

---


[Rain and thunder]

---

## JESS:
Which way should we go?

---

## EMILIE:
Let’s split up.

---

The important thing is to find her quickly.

---

## JESS:
Are you joking?

---

## EMILIE:
Sh!

---

## JESS:
We cannot split up.

---

What if one of us gets lost? Do you even have your phone on you?

---

## EMILIE:
Of course.

---

And it’s at two percent.

---

Shit.

---

## JESS:
I think we should try to run a line straight out from the cabin.

---

## EMILIE:
What is “straight out”? That’s not — that’s not an objective — that’s not even a direction.

---

## JESS:
Fine, Bear Grylls, do you have a compass?

---

## EMILIE:
I have a compass app.

---

We could at least pick something that’s consistent.

---

## KELLY:
Shh, stop.

---

I heard something.

---

## EMILIE:
What?

---

## KELLY:
Not sure yet; shut up.

---

[Faint footsteps]

---

## JESS:
Shit, what was that?

---

## KELLY:
It could be Cass.

---

Stay still till we can see.

---

[Heavy footsteps, moving closer]

---

## EMILIE:
Shit, get ready to run.

---

[Storm is louder]

---

## KELLY:
Wait till we can see…
---
[Muffled grunting]
---

[Screams and shouts]
---

[Thunder]
---

[Screams and muffled grunts]

---
[Thunderstorm and rain]



---

---

[Stuggling and grunting]


---

## KELLY:
Holy shit we just kicked a guy’s fucking ass in the fucking woods! Why did we do that? How did we do that? 

---

What the fuck are we supposed to do now? Why didn’t we leave him there? I feel sick.

---

I gotta get out of here.

---

My parents’ house isn’t that far; I could drive there right now.

---

Emilie, where the fuck are your keys?

---

## EMILIE:
Cass has them.

---

## KELLY and JESS:
What?!	

---

## EMILIE:
I always give Cass my keys when I drink.

---

## KELLY:
Fuck

---

## JESS:
We can’t leave.

---

We have to wait for Cass.

---

She could come back at any second.

---

## EMILIE:
What if she doesn’t?

---

## JESS:
How can you say that? She’s been missing for all of what, twenty minutes? Maybe half an hour? We don’t even know they ran across each other!

---

## EMILIE:
Then why hasn’t she come back?

---

## JESS:
How the fuck should I know?!

---

## KELLY:
Please stop shouting

---

## EMILIE:
This is going to be so bad if this isn’t the guy.

---

## JESS:
What other dude is gonna be out here jumping at women and trying to grab them in the woods?! 

---

In the middle of a thunderstorm?! We had every right to defend ourselves.

---

## EMILIE:
Sure, but that is not what we did.

---

We unleashed a lifetime’s worth of female rage on that guy.

---

His face is all messed up.

---

I think we knocked some of his teeth out.

---

His breathing sounds real nasty coming out of the mess Kelly made of his nose.

---

This does not look good.

---

## KELLY:
Fuck his nose

---

## JESS:
Yeah, fuck him! This guy is a murderer! Who gives a fuck about his nose?

---

## KELLY:
We should go.

---

We can help Cass better from somewhere safe.

---

[All phones buzz an emergency alert]

---

## EMILIE:
The road’s flooded.

---

Even if I had the keys, we’re not getting out tonight.

---

## KELLY:
Okay so then we find her.

---

We find her, and we bring her back —

---

## JESS:
What do we do with him?

---

## KELLY:
I don’t know, leave him here?

---

## EMILIE:
How good are those handcuffs?

---

## JESS:
I don’t fucking know! I didn’t bring them for this!

---

## EMILIE:
Man, I really need to start looking at my life and my choices.

---

## JESS:
I’m sorry, what?

---

## EMILIE:
I’m out in the middle of nowhere in a flood, and I just beat up a white guy.

---

Why did I agree to come on this trip? What the fuck was I thinking? 
---
Why am I here? What am I doing with my life? 
---
I am twenty-nine, I am someone’s receptionist, the thing I love doesn’t make me any money … 
---
this is really just the latest and most fucked of a series of choices I have made that objectively make no sense to me at all —

---

## KELLY:
Emilie …

---

## EMILIE:
No, no, I think I’m on the precipice of a real personal revelation here.

---

Why am I here? I can’t be here with this dude.

---

I should leave.

---

I should get the fuck out of here.

---

Maybe I can hotwire the car; that’s a thing, right?

---

## JESS:
Not.

---

Without.

---

Cass.

---

## EMILIE:
Jess, I love Cass —

---

## JESS:
Oh, fuck you!

---

## EMILIE:
Fuck you! If you hadn’t given Cass that stupid dare, she wouldn’t be gone, and we wouldn’t be in this mess!

---

## JESS:
She wasn’t supposed to go more than a few feet from the cabin! It was barely dark out!

---

## EMILIE:
It was fully dark out!

---

## JESS:
I know! I know, ok? I thought she’d come right back in! We were all drunk, ok?

---

## KELLY:
Dude,are you not still drunk?

---

## JESS:
It’s my fault.

---

It’s my fault.

---

Oh god — she’s dead, isn’t she? She’s dead somewhere, and we can’t find her, and we don’t know where she is —

---

## KELLY:
She’s alive.

---

She’s got to be alive.

---

Which means we have to get back out there.

---

## EMILIE:
We can’t leave him here alone.

---

What if he gets out?

---

## JESS:
No no no no no.

---

You want to leave one of us here to babysit the murderer??

---

## KELLY:
We don’t know that he’s a murderer.

---

He could be some random fucking guy.

---

## EMILIE:
And if he says he’s not the guy, who’s going to believe us? We literally beat this dude up, tied him up, and then held him captive.

---

## JESS:
What the hell were we supposed to do? Let him get away? Let him run off into the woods to do God knows what to God knows who else?

---

## KELLY:
Did he have a gun on him? Because I would feel differently if he does.

---

## EMILIE:
He could have it for hunting.

---

He could say he was defending himself from us!

---

## JESS:
He doesn’t.

---

## KELLY:
Are you sure?

---

## JESS:
I patted him down while you and Emilie were cuffing him.

---

## KELLY:
You what?

---

## JESS:
I thought he might have a weapon, so I checked.

---

We’re good.

---

He didn’t have anything on him except this.

---



---

## KELLY:
Jesus, Jess!

---

## EMILIE:
What the fuck? No wallet? Not even a phone?

---

## JESS:
Nope.

---

He has to be the guy from the news

---

## KELLY:
Regardless, we need to go the fuck back outside, and find Cass.

---

She is our priority.

---

## EMILIE:
We should let him go.

---

## JESS:
What

---

## EMILIE:
We should let him go.

---

It’s been dark out this whole time; it was dark in here when we brought him in.

---

Plus he’s wearing that fucking thing over his head.

---

He couldn’t have gotten a good look at us.

---

## JESS:
We’re going to toss him back out into the woods? With Cass still out there?

---

## EMILIE:
Maybe … maybe we knock him out?

---

## KELLY:
He could drown

---

## JESS:
Big whoop, so he accidentally drowns.

---

## EMILIE:
Woah, Jess

---

## JESS:
I want to find my girlfriend! I don’t care what happens to him.

---

## KELLY:
Fuck this, I’m out.

---

## JESS:
I’m going to ask him where Cass is.

---

## KELLY:
I dont think that’s a good idea.

---

## EMILIE:
What is talking to him going to accomplish?

---

## JESS:
He knows where Cass is.

---

## KELLY:
Maybe

---

## EMILIE:
Wear something over your face at least.

---

T-shirt or bandana or something.

---

Or leave the lights off.

---

## JESS:
I wasn’t planning to turn them on

---

## KELLY:
Please be careful.

---

## JESS:
Okay.

---

Three, two — 

---

## KELLY:
I know you make fun of me for all the murder podcasts, but I can tell you exactly how this ends, and it is going to be so bad.

---

## EMILIE:
I know.

---

I know.

---

## KELLY:
Can we let him go? Do you think … ?

---

## EMILIE:
Maybe we can make a deal with him — we never saw him; he never saw us.

---

## KELLY:
Do you really think that would work?

---

## EMILIE:
I mean, if he’s talking to the cops, that would mean that they found him, they arrested him.

---

And what’s he going to tell them? “Officer, I was just wandering through the woods doing my murders when these three women beat the absolute shit out of me.”

---

---

## KELLY:
I don’t know…

---

## EMILIE:
C’mon.

---

Jess has totally lost the plot here.

---

She’s gonna go all tiny John Wick on his ass.

---

## JESS:
Whenever you’re ready, it’d be cool if you stopped talking about me like I’m not here.

---

That got old, like, five minutes after we got here.

---

## KELLY:
We weren’t —

---

## JESS:
The ucking walls, Kelly? I don’t care if you think I’ve lost it, I really don’t, 


---

but commenting on the sex I have with my girlfriend? That didn’t cross any lines for you? 

---

That’s the kind of codependent friendship y’all have, huh?

---

## EMILIE:
I was out of line, alright? I didn’t think you could hear us.

---

I’m sorry.

---

Okay? I want Cass back just as much as you.

---

More.

---

## JESS:
Bitch, you think — ?

---

## EMILIE:
Oh, fuck you.

---

I have known Cass forever; you showed up four months ago.

---

[Cries and struggling]

---

## KELLY:
Quit it! Fucking quit it! Are you two done? Good.

---

Because here’s what we’re not going to do.

---

We’re not going to keep fighting each other when Cass needs our help.

---

We’ve been fixating on him.

---

He doesn’t matter.

---

Whether he is the guy, isn’t the guy, doesn’t matter.

---

If we let him go, if we keep him here, I don’t give a fuck.

---

We should be out there looking for Cass, and if I have to bang your heads together until that sinks in, I’m happy to do it.

---


---

## EMILIE:
What id he say?

---

## JESS:
He said he doesn’t know.

---

Then he said he wouldn’t tell me.

---

Then he said if he told me, we wouldn’t need him anymore.

---

## EMILIE:
What the fuck?!

---

## JESS:
I know.

---

He’s fucking scary.

---

## EMILIE:
Wouldn’t need him anymore? Does he think we’re going to torture him for Cass’s location and then dump his body? Who the fuck does he think we are?

---

## JESS:
That is an option.

---

## EMILIE:
No it’s not.

---

## JESS:
Why not?

---

## EMILIE:
This is so bad, and everything we do from this point on makes it worse.

---

## JESS:
I’m not hearing any other ideas! Besides leaving, which we can’t do without the car, 

---

we can’t do with the road flooded, so if you have an idea of something we can do, I am all ears!

---

## KELLY:
We go back out and search! Jesus, it’s like no one hears a word I say.

---

## JESS:
All of us?

---

## KELLY:
Yes

---

## EMILIE:
And if the cheap-ass handcuffs break?

---

## KELLY:
We have to hope they don’t.

---

If they do … we have to hope he runs away from us, not towards us.

---

And in a worst case scenario …

---

## EMILIE:
I’m sorry; this isn’t a worst case scenario?

---

## KELLY:
We took him down once.

---

I think we could do it again.

---

## JESS:
Okay.

---

Okay.

---

## JESS:
Emile, come on.

---

## EMILIE:
I’m scared! Okay, is that what you want to hear? I’m fucking scared.

---

I was scared when we went out the first time, and look what happened! What if we get caught?

---

What if the cops show up here looking for him? What if we don’t find Cass? What if we find her and she’s hurt or worse? I can’t, I can’t …

---

## JESS:
It’s okay.

---

It’s okay.

---

You’re in shock.

---

Kelly, could you grab some water, please? 

---


---

Emilie, can I hold your hand?

---

## EMILIE:
Fine

---

## JESS:
Give my hand some gentle squeezes.

---

## EMILIE:
Why?

---

## JESS:
It’s grounding.

---

Your body needs to recalibrate.

---

It’s been through a lot tonight.

---

## EMILIE:
So has yours.

---

## JESS:
I’m sure I’ll break down at some point, too.

---

You’re not weak.

---

I’m not strong.

---

## EMILIE:
I thouht I hated you.

---

## JESS:
I know.

---

## EMILIE:
I’m jealous of you.

---

## JESS:
I know
---
Cass loves you, you know.

---

I know it’s not the way you want.

---

But I think she loves you more than anyone on this earth.

---

## EMILIE:
And that’s okay with you?

---

## JESS:
Yes

---

## EMILIE:
I love her.

---

I’ve loved her ever since I’ve known her.

---

Do you know how old I was when I met Cass? Eleven.

---

Fucking eleven.

---

We were in the fucking Girl Scouts.

---

And I’d already started to realize that I didn’t like boys and I thought I was super broken 

---

and then I saw Cass’s stupid, adorable face and it was like my whole brain clicked.

---

It was like someone did a Rubic’s cube solve on me, like everything spun into place.

---

Do you know how many nights I spent lying awake in my sleeping bag, staring at the back of her hair? 

---

Thinking about how it sounded when she said my name? And I came out and like, all of my
friends abandoned me.

---

Or at least that whole girl scout troop.

---

And Cass was totally cool.

---

She quit with me.

---

She read them the riot act — I swear, I had never seen her really mad before and she told those girls exactly how they were failing to live up to the Girl Scout Law.

---

It was the funniest thing I’ve ever seen.

---

She was dead serious about it — we were just these little thirteen-year-olds taking ourselves so seriously … 

---

and then she came out, too, in high school, and I thought it was gonna be...

---


and it never was.

---

It never, never was — she went away to college, dated people — but I didn’t have to look at them, 

---

and when she came to visit, it was just her and me, like it had always been.

---
And they always faded.

---

And I dated people too but it wasn’t … I was killing time and I knew it.

---

And then you show up — and come here — I started this trip, and Cass just drags you along — 

---

and I — I can’t even look at the two of you without my stomach curling up …

---

## KELLY:
This is all I could find

---

## EMILIE:
God, that is disgusting!

---

## KELLY:
You’re welcome

---

## EMILIE:
So what do we do now?

---

## KELLY:
We go back out and search for Cass.

---

All of us.

---

## JESS:
No.

---

I said I wanted to, and I want to, but … the idea of him getting away …

---

## EMILIE:
Honestly, I think it’s for the best if he does.

---

If he runs away and never tells anybody about it.

---

That might be the only thing that could save our asses.

---

## JESS:
And what if he hurt Cass? You’re fine with him just walking out of here?

---

## EMILIE:
No, I’m not fine with it.

---

We’re in a situation with a lot of bad options, and that one is not that bad.

---

## JESS:
Not that bad?!

---

## KELLY:
We have to try.

---

We can’t … I don’t like the idea of us getting separated.

---

For anything.

---

## JESS:
Look, I’m sorry, but I can’t accept that we might walk out the door and this guy might go on and live a full and happy life somewhere! That’s not okay with me.

---

## EMILIE:
You’re not the only person who gets a say.

---

Because you’re not the only person who would take the fall.

---

If he escapes or we let him go, we can pretend this never happened.

---
We agree never to speak of it again — hell, Cass doesn’t even need to know! And let karma sort him out.

---

## JESS:
Okay, him getting out of the handcuffs while we’re gone is one thing, but you’re not seriously contemplating letting him go?

---

## EMILIE:
I’m seriously contemplating everything right now.

---

## KELLY:
Jess, the cops were searching for this guy before the storm rolled through.

---

They’ll start up again as soon as it clears.

---

There’s a manhunt out for this guy.

---

There’s a murder investigation.

---

I don’t want to fuck with a murder investigation.

---

I want to go home.

---

In one piece.

---

So does Emilie.

---

And I want you to go home in one piece.

---

That’s very important to me.

---

## JESS:
And what about Cass?

---

## KELLY:
I want to find her.

---

I do! But … we need help.

---

## EMILIE:
What do you suggest we do?

---

## JESS:
I’m gonna ask him where Cass is again, and if he doesn’t answer, I am going to punch him in the face

---
template: overlap
## KELLY:	
Noooo	


## EMILIE:
Absolutely not

---

## JESS:
Why the fuck not?!

---
template: overlap
## KELLY:	
He’s already hurt?	

## EMILIE:
We’re gonna go to jail?!

---

## JESS:
He knows where she is.

---

## KELLY:
Maybe he doesn’t

---

## JESS:
I want some goddamn answers

---

## KELLY:
Absolutely not

---

## JESS:
We already beat him up! What the fuck does this matter?

---

## EMILIE:
It’s torture

---

## JESS:
No it isn’t

---

## KELLY:
That s the literal definition of the thing you just suggested.

---

You want to hurt him until he gives you information.

---

## JESS:
If he won’t tell us where she is, which means he hurt her — I will kill him.

---

You two can stay out here if you don’t want to take part in that.

---

But I won’t see him walk out of here.

---

## KELLY:
You want to axe-chop an unarmed man until he’s dead? Until he stops breathing? 

---

That is a sick way to kill someone, and I don’t think you’re the kind of person who kills someone!

---

## JESS:
It’s not that hard to kill someone.

---
I want him to get what he deserves.

---

How often does that happen? What if he runs off into the woods and the cops never find him?

---

What if he gets arrested and he goes to court and they let him off? Or he goes to prison, but only for a minute, 

---

and then they let him out and he does this again?

---

## KELLY:
We can’t fix that by killing him.

---

He could be some normal man and this is all a horrible mistake!

---

## JESS:
Come on! He ran at us, he fought us — and he had a wire on him! The guy on the news was strangling people! 

---

If he’s some normal man, why does he not have a wallet? A phone? Anything? Why was he out in the middle of this storm?

---

## KELLY:
I know it looks bad, but there could be another explanation.

---

We don’t know.

---

## JESS:
I have a bad gut feeling.

---

That comes from somewhere.

---

That is my brain and my body indexing everyone, harmless or eventually harmful, that I’ve ever come across, and reminding me where the harmful people’s traits match up with this guy’s.

---

It is not nothing.

---

The times I have tried to push away a bad gut feeling about someone are also the times I got hurt.

---

## KELLY:
So based on a bad gut feeling you’re going to kill someone?

---

## JESS:
HIS LIFE MEANS NOTHING TO ME!

---

## KELLY:
Jess, I know he doesn’t mean anything to you personally, but —

---

## JESS:
I don’t need to respect people just because they’re people.

---

People don’t do that for me.

---

People don’t consider the worth of my life.

---

What I might want or not want.

---

Especially not people like him.

---

## KELLY:
You cannot.

---

Kill someone.

---

Because random people out in the world are dicks to you.

---

## JESS:
Except it’s not random.

---

It is consistently people who look and act like him.

---

Old enough for it to be creepy but not so old they couldn’t hurt me if they wanted to.

---

White.

---
“Normal-looking.” Boring.

---

And then there’s a little something off about them, that feeling in your gut that says, “Do not flip this guy off.

---

Do not tell him what you think of his behavior.

---

He will not like it and you do not know what he will do.”

---

I’ve had it up to here
— I’ve had it past here.

---

I live my whole life in fear of guys like that.

---

Every day.

---

Every walk home.

---

I’m done.

---

He’s here, we won; I want to finish it.

---

## KELLY:
I know the world is shitty, and it’s filled with shitty people who are empowered by shitty systems to do shitty things.

---

That is awful, and you’re not alone in it.

---

But what I care about is getting us all home safely.

---

Hurting him doesn’t help us.

---

## JESS:
Fine.

---

Fine.

---

---


## JESS:
Goddammit, let me —

---

## KELLY:
Fuck, I’m sorry Jess, I’m so sorry —

---

## JESS:
No you’re right.

---

You’re right.

---

I’m so angry.

---

I’m so … Cass … 

---

## EMILIE:
It’s okay.

---

## JESS:
I’m sorry

---

## EMILIE:
We’ll find her.

---

We’ll find her.

---
You told me you’d break down at some point.

---

## JESS:
I did

---

## EMILIE:
Are you okay?

---

## JESS:
No.

---

Yes.

---

## KELLY:
Let’s go.

---

Let’s go find Cass.

---

---



[Rain and thunder]


---

[Coughing]



---

## CASS:
(Rasping, barely audible) Emilie? Jess? Kelly?
---

[Muffled grunt from bedroom]

---

[A terrified cry]

---

## CASS:
No no no no no


---

[Labored breathing]

---

[A muffled scream]

---

[Primal screams and ax chops]

---


---


## EMILIE:
Cass?

---

[Thunder]
