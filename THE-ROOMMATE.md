(The kitchen.)
(SHARONfinishes helping ROBIN.
carry boxes in. So many boxes/ One contains weird veg-etables from a CSA. Some vegetables are just odd,but others look actively dangerous.)
---
## SHARON:
(A little out of breath.) And this is the kitchen I'm a big cook, I love to cook
You said you cooked?
---
## ROBYN:
I cook, sure.
---
## SHARON:
Okay! Okay
Well
we can divide up the refrigerator or the pantry shelves depending on
sort of what and when you cook
---
## ROBYN:
I'm a vegan
---
## SHARON:
(Doesn't really know what that is.) Okay! Okay...
---
## ROBYN:
No animal products.
---
## SHARON:
Okay!
So like...no meat...
---
## ROBYN:
Nope, no meat
---
## SHARON:
Or eggs
---
## ROBYN:
That would be an animal product
---
## SHARON:
Sure! Sure it would
Uh...but like, carrots
---
## ROBYN:
Yes carrots are fine
---
## SHARON:
I mean, clearly carrots are [fine] ...but for example, using pans or pots or
knives or
9
you know, that I've used for meat...
I mean, is that going to be...?
---
## ROBYN:
I have my own cooking utensils
in one of the boxes there's
---
## SHARON:
Oh! sure sure
yeah we can find
there's some extra cabinet space if we just
move things around a bit
---
## ROBYN:
Yeah there's a lot of space
this seems very spacious
---
## SHARON:
I mean there's space
it's notpalatial but
I mean, Iowa, it specializes in
corn and space
(She laughs, ---
## ROBYN:
doesn't•Awkward.)
If you want you can leave stuff on the porch 'til you're all unpacked
---
## ROBYN:
Oh no no, I don't want to take up your ---
## SHARON:
No no! That's fine
I don't use the side porch that much anyway it's nice in the summer I guess but
(Picking up a weird vegetable:)
What's this?
---
## ROBYN:
That's goya.
---
## SHARON:
What-now?
---
## ROBYN:
Goya. It's a vegetable.
A bitter gourd.
---
## SHARON:
Okay! Yes. Yes. Wow. Well. I see I am going to
learn a lot from having you os a roommate.
(She laughs. ---
## ROBYN:
doesn't really.)
(Beat.)
You must be tired. Driving all the way from... New York, you said?
---
## ROBYN:
The Bronx.
---
## SHARON:
The -! The Bronx!
---
## ROBYN:
Took about two days, by car.
---
## SHARON:
I thought...
---
## ROBYN:
What?
---
## SHARON:
I don't know,
When you said New York, I thought
somewhere Upstate
I didn't think...
Isn't the Bronx...
dangerous?
---
## ROBYN:
"Dangerous."
---
## SHARON:
And you're - I mean. You're a woman. I mean. I don't know.
I've never lived in New York.
---
## ROBYN:
It's okay. I mean. There's parts. Parts where you
don't wanna
late at night, you don't wanna
but it's fine. I stayed there for a little while and nothing ever
---
## SHARON:
(With relief) Oh you aren'tfrom the Bronx!
(A slight pause.)
---
## ROBYN:
Everywhere has parts like that.
---
## SHARON:
Oh it's mostly pretty safe here.
Except for the tornados.
---
## ROBYN:
(Alarmed.) Tornados?
---
## SHARON:
Oh yeah, in the spring mostly
early summer
you just go on down to the basement 'til they pass. It's fine.
---
## ROBYN:
(Even more alarmed.) There are a lot of tornados here?
---
## SHARON:
Not as bad as some places.
---
## ROBYN:
Like how many tornados would you say, on average?
---
## SHARON:
It's fine! If you hear that big old siren
you just go down to the basement.
Really
it's no scarier than the Bronx.
---
## ROBYN:
(Has to smile.) I guess not if you're from here.
---
## SHARON:
(Immediately.) I'm notfrom here. You know. I'm
not Iowan.
---
## ROBYN:
Oh okay
---
## SHARON:
I don't know if I said that?
When we talked on the phone, if I said that?
---
## ROBYN:
I don't think so, but it doesn't really
---
## SHARON:
I'm from Illinois, originally.
---
## ROBYN:
Oh!
---
## SHARON:
It's actually quite different from Iowa.
---
## ROBYN:
I'll take your word for it.
(Beat.)
---
## SHARON:
My son lives in New York.
---
## ROBYN:
Oh!
You have a son?
---
## SHARON:
I do, he lives in New York.
---
## ROBYN:
That's great. In the Bronx?
---
## SHARON:
No! No no
He lives
"Park Slope" do you know where [that is?]
He lives in "Park Slope."
---
## ROBYN:
Oh yeah, that's great.
---
## SHARON:
He pays way too much for [rent]
I tell him that all the time, I say
In Iowa you could have a house for the money you
spend on [rent]
(Laughs alittle, stops.)
He doesn't like it when I say that.
He didn't like Iowa.
---
## ROBYN:
The tornados?
---
## SHARON:
No he just didn't like it.
(Beat. Have they run out of conversation? SHARON hastens.)
He's a designet
---
## ROBYN:
Oh! That's great!
---
## SHARON:
He's very good, everybody thinks he's very good.
---
## ROBYN:
What does he design?
---
## SHARON:
(Doesn't really know.) Clothes, he mostly designs clothes. For women?
---
## ROBYN:
Oh!
---
## SHARON:
Everybody thinks he's a homosexual, but he's not.
(Where did this come from? SHARON has surprised herself A beat.)
---
## ROBYN:
I'm gay.
---
## SHARON:
Oh!
You're -?
Oh!!
You're -??
(Beat.)
I mean, I don't have any problem with homose‚mals. ---
## ROBYN:
Oh good.
---
## SHARON:
Nope. Not at all. I think, you know, gay rights! Let them marry!
---
## ROBYN:
Thank you.
---
## SHARON:
Some of my son's friends are homose2mal people. Probably most of them.
---
## ROBYN:
Oh.
---
## SHARON:
I think most New Yorkers are.
---
## ROBYN:
I think actually there are a lot of straight people in New York.
---
## SHARON:
I ldssed a girl once in college.
(Beat.)
I'm sorry. I'm nervous.
---
## ROBYN:
Why are you nervous?
---
## SHARON:
I mean. A roommate! I've never had a roommate.
(This is an admission offailure:)
I'm fifty-four years old.
A roommate!
---
## ROBYN:
It's okay. You'll save money.
---
## SHARON:
No, I know! I know. I definitely
I will definitely save money.
(Beat.)
You - did you have a lot more boxes in the car?
---
## ROBYN:
I've got it.
---
## SHARON:
(Really doesn't want to keep carrying boxes.) Well if you're sure.
---
## ROBYN:
Be right back.
(She exits back out to the car.)
(SHARON sits alone in her kitchen with all these new, weird vegetables. She takes a deep breath. Okay. It's okay.)
---
## SHARON:
(Calling after ---
## ROBYN:
) Today is my reading group! ---
## ROBYN:
(Offstage.) What did you say?
---
## SHARON:
Oh, I said: today is my reading group. If you want to come with me.
(---
## ROBYN:
returns. She's carrying a heavy box.) ---
## ROBYN:
Your "reading group"?
---
## SHARON:
You know, a book club. Only Tanya calls it a reading group -
(She jumps up to help ---
## ROBYN:
set the box on the table. ---
## ROBYN:
pulls away.)
---
## ROBYN:
I've got it!
---
## SHARON:
- Tanya's the one who runs it, she says everything just a little bit wrong, it's because she's from Idaho and there wasn't any culture there, so she didn't get exposed to things until much later in life.
(Beat.)
Is that more vegetables?
---
## ROBYN:
No that goes upstairs.
A reading group...
(Beat.)
Isn't that. Kind of. For old people?
---
## SHARON:
(Amazed) We are old people.
---
## ROBYN:
(Amazed.) We are?
(A beat. They study each other. Each is kind of bajjled by the other. Then ---
## ROBYN:
turns away.)
I'll just take this upstairs. But thanks for the invitation.
---
## SHARON:
You're so welcome. You let me know if there's
anything you need.
Mi casa es su casa!
(Beat)
Literally.
---
## ROBYN:
Okay then.
(She picks up the box and almost drops it.)
(A ceramic doll falls out and smashes.) (The box is full of ceramic dolls.)
---
## SHARON:
Oh no!
---
## ROBYN:
Stay there!
(---
## ROBYN:
moves quickly between SHARON and the shards.)
---
## SHARON:
Are you okay? Do you need help?
---
## ROBYN:
(Sharp.) I've got this!
Is there a [broom]?
---
## SHARON:
Here...
(Gets her a broom.)
Do you want me to...?
---
## ROBYN:
No no
---
## ROBYN:
I've got it.
(As she sweeps - calmer.)
Sorry. I didn't mean to [snap]
I just didn't want you to get cut.
---
## SHARON:
(Peering into the box.) What...are all these dolls?
---
## ROBYN:
Please!!
(SHARON moves away from the box.)
Sorry. They're - it's personal.
---
## SHARON:
I didn't mean to pry.
---
## ROBYN:
I made them. I used to be a potter.
---
## SHARON:
You were?
---
## ROBYN:
They're patterned atter these antique South
American dolls.
---
## SHARON:
Oh! Wow
---
## ROBYN:
But then I stopped. So.
It's a little embarrassing.
---
## SHARON:
You shouldn't be embarrassed, they're very
(She doesn't like them.)
Evocative.
---
## ROBYN:
Evocative?
---
## SHARON:
They evoke things.
---
## ROBYN:
They're actually voodoo dolls.
---
## SHARON:
Voodoo??
---
## ROBYN:
Kidding.
---
## SHARON:
I mean I don't know
They look a little voodoo-y to me.
---
## ROBYN:
Maybe they evoke voodoo.
(A beat. They share a smile.)
---
## SHARON:
I didn't mean that in a bad way.
---
## ROBYN:
It's okay. I'm done with all that.
---
## SHARON:
Why did you stop?
---
## ROBYN:
I stopped because
uh
it wasn't the sort of lifestyle
that...
Being a potter can be very
stressful.
(Beat.)
---
## SHARON:
Your boxes are so heavy and you just got here.
Leave them on the porch and put your feet up.
I'll get us coffee.
---
## ROBYN:
Is your porch safe?
---
## SHARON:
Safe?
---
## ROBYN:
Break-ins?
---
## SHARON:
This is Iowa.
---
## ROBYN:
Yes?
---
## SHARON:
No break-ins.
---
## ROBYN:
But you lock the doors?
---
## SHARON:
I can lock the doors.
If that makes you feel comfortable, I can start locking
the doors.
---
## ROBYN:
I feel better with things. Locked.
---
## SHARON:
A New York thing?
---
## ROBYN:
Sure.
---
## SHARON:
A Bronx thing?
---
## ROBYN:
A ---
## ROBYN:
thing.
(Re: the doll box.)
I'II just take this up to my room...
---
## SHARON:
Oh! Just up the stairs
immediate left -
would you like me to show you?
---
## ROBYN:
I've got it.
Here we go, take two.
(She hoists the box with the dolls and exits upstairs.)
2.
(Morning. Küchen.)
(SHARON on the phone with her son.)
---
## SHARON:
(Excited, sotto voce.) And here's the other thing! She's a homosexuan
(Beat.)
Well I don't care OF COURSE, but you asked if anything interesting happened, and I thought that was interesting.
(Beat.)
Also she used to be a potter
she said she made voodoo dolls but
she was just joshing me.
(Beat.)
When are you going to come visit?
(Beat - he's too busy.)
No... I know...of course, yes...
No, forget it, maybe over the summer.
(Beat.)
Maybe I should come visit you.
(Beat - he's trying to get out of this.)
We always have such fun when I visit you! I love staying with you, your roommate is so lovely, the tau l one, what's his name... Do you know what he did last time, he did the funniest thing, did I tell you this? He was -
(Beat - her son is saying that she has told him this so many times.)
Oh. Oh yes. I guess I did, didn't I.
(Beat.)
She's joined a...local farm. And she just got here! She
just picked up some boxes of vegetables on her way here. I mean that's very healthy, she seems very healthy. And she just bought a folding bicycle, like a...like sort of a folding chair, but it's a bicycle.
(Her son isn't as impressed as she is.)
Anyway, she seems like a very healthy person with a very sort of healthy lifestyle, and I just think this is all going to just be very healthy for me.
(---
## ROBYN:
wanders in. She's smoking.)
(SHARON coughs. She coughs pointedly.) (---
## ROBYN:
glances of her.)
---
## ROBYN:
Oh! Sorry!
(SHARON coughs and fons the air.)
Sorry!
(---
## ROBYN:
goes out onto the porch and chain-smokes.)
(Back to the phone:)
---
## SHARON:
(Intense whisper.) SHE. IS. SMOKING.
(Beat.)
Well I thought I was fairly clear about that when I said I was looldng for a woman in her fifties.
(Beat.)
Are you LAUGHING at me?
(Beat.)
I have to go.
(Beat - he's apologizing, but she won't be mollified.)
No, no it's okay. I have to go. I know how busy you are.
(She hangs up.)
(A beat.)
(---
## ROBYN:
comes back in.)
---
## ROBYN:
Morning.
---
## SHARON:
Good morning.
(Beat.)
---
## ROBYN:
Sorry about that.
---
## SHARON:
I didn't know you smoked.
---
## ROBYN:
I quit. I'm quitting. I quit.
---
## SHARON:
Oh.
---
## ROBYN:
I quit right before I moved. So.
---
## SHARON:
Oh.
---
## ROBYN:
New places stress me out.
---
## SHARON:
You weren't stressed out in the Brom but you're
stressed out in Iowa?
---
## ROBYN:
I was stressed out in the Bronx, which is why I
smoked there.
And I am stressed out in Iowa, which is why I just
smoked here.
Even though I quit.
I am re-quitting.
---
## SHARON:
They have nicotine grum at the gas station.
They didn't used to, but now it's become popular.
---
## ROBYN:
The gum is no good, I get hooked on the grum.
I just need to quit cold turkey.
Ever3rthing that I do, I just need to DO it, no half-

measures. Just jump.
---
## SHARON:
(Impressed despite hers4) Like moving to Iowa?
---
## ROBYN:
Like moving to Iowa.
(A warmer beat between the women: a shared humor.)
---
## SHARON:
Do you want some eggs? I was gonna make eggs.
---
## ROBYN:
I can't, but thanks.
---
## SHARON:
You -?
Oh!
Vegan!
---
## ROBYN:
Vegan.
---
## SHARON:
Vegan.
Coffee? Without milk?
---
## ROBYN:
I'd love some coffee. With almond milk. 
---
## SHARON:
I don't have almond milk.
---
## ROBYN:
I got it from the co-op yesterday.
You can try it.
(She gets out the almond milk.) (SHARON thinks it's very strange, but:)
---
## SHARON:
(Very determined.) Okay yes.
Yes, I will.
(She lets ROBYN:
put almond milk in her coffee. They drink coffee together.)
les...
---
## ROBYN:
Weird?
---
## SHARON:
Weird.
---
## ROBYN:
Bad?
---
## SHARON:
Not bad.
(Beat.)
(The warmth between them becomes awk-

ward again.)
So what do you do?
---
## ROBYN:
Me?
---
## SHARON:
Uh. You.
---
## ROBYN:
Well. I do a lot of things.
(SHARON waits. ---
## ROBYN:
drin/es more almond-milk coffee.)
---
## SHARON:
Oh.
Well.
Like what do you do?
For example.
---
## ROBYN:
Well.
(Beat.)
---
## ROBYN:
I'm a poet.
---
## SHARON:
A poet!
---
## ROBYN:
Yes, I write poetry.
(Beat.)
---
## SHARON:
That's great!
I love poetry!
(Beat - honest.)
I don't really understand poetry.
---
## ROBYN:
I write slam poetry.
---
## SHARON:
I don't know what that is.
---
## ROBYN:
I write poems and then I perform them.
---
## SHARON:
And what do you write...about?
(A pause.)
---
## ROBYN:
I do other things too.
---
## SHARON:
Oh?
---
## ROBYN:
I grow things. I like to grow things.
---
## SHARON:
I never had much of a green thumb but
that's wonderful!
What do you grow?
(A pause.)
---
## ROBYN:
VVhat do you do?
---
## SHARON:
(Completely off-balanced.) Me?
I mean.
I live here. Obviously.
---
## ROBYN:
Yeah...
---
## SHARON:
I'm a mother...
---
## ROBYN:
Right.
---
## SHARON:
I'm retired!
---
## ROBYN:
From what?
(Beat.)
---
## SHARON:
My maniage.
---
## ROBYN:
Oh.
---
## SHARON:
Yeah. So.
---
## ROBYN:
I'm sorry?
---
## SHARON:
Don't be.
---
## ROBYN:
Then I'm not.
(Beat, ---
## ROBYN:
smiles, then SHARON does.) (A shared moment.)
---
## SHARON:
I'd love to hear some of your poems.
---
## ROBYN:
Oh. I don't think so.
---
## SHARON:
Maybe you could explain them to me.
---
## ROBYN:
Poetry can't really...be explained.
---
## SHARON:
That's probably why I don't like it.
Oh! Sorry! I didn't mean...
---
## ROBYN:
No. No no. It's okay.
I don't like poetry either.
---
## SHARON:
You don't?
---
## ROBYN:
I like mine. But I don't have a lot of patience for
other people's.
---
## SHARON:
I think I feel that way about children.
---
## ROBYN:
I think I feel that way about most things.
(Another shared smile. Beat.)
---
## SHARON:
So...why Iowa?
---
## ROBYN:
Why not Iowa?
---
## SHARON:
Do you know anybody here?
---
## ROBYN:
You.
---
## SHARON:
Me?
---
## ROBYN:
You now.
Now I know you.
(This pleases ---
## SHARON:
)
---
## SHARON:
Well
what would you like to do
here?
There's the University, there's adult classes
(there's poetry!)
or
hot yoga
on North Clinton
Which I've never taken but I see everybody through the
vvindow
when I go by, and they all look so
Healthy and Happy, you sort of want to injure them
but yeah, so, there's yoga...
My son thinks Iowa City is boring but
if he just visited me more often he'd see that
now it's very cultural here, Iowa City is actually very
[cultural]
I mean / sort of haven't [been involved]
but you might want to [be involved]
---
## ROBYN:
I thought maybe I'd raise bees.
---
## SHARON:
Bees.
---
## ROBYN:
And maybe a sheep or
a cow or
something.
---
## SHARON:
A...sheep.
---
## ROBYN:
I don't know, I imagined
wide open skies, I think and
rising at dawn...
A sort of_restorative manual labor...
---
## SHARON:
OII...hmm...
We could have a garden...?
---
## ROBYN:
My grrandmother was from Iowa.
---
## SHARON:
She was?
(---
## ROBYN:
has surprised them both with this revelation. A moment.)
---
## ROBYN:
I didn't know her.
But.
I heard she was from Iowa.
---
## SHARON:
(Beat - a Utile wisffidly.) I guess everybody wants
to start over. Just bum it all down and start over.
---
## ROBYN:
(A genuine question.) Do you?
---
## SHARON:
I don't know...
---
## ROBYN:
You said "everybody." So...don't you?
---
## SHARON:
I guess I do. Sometimes.
---
## ROBYN:
Maybe you already did. When you...retired...from your marriage.
---
## SHARON:
No, that didn't feel like a...glorious blaze. lt just
feels -
felt
very sad. And cold.
And then there was nobody to talk to in the mornings.
(Beat.)
He retired before I did.
Actually.
From the marriage.
But he didn't tell me that, so I had to find it out myself.
---
## ROBYN:
Another woman?
---
## SHARON:
No
He just started spending all his money on models of
things
airplanes, trains, cars
and he'd spend all his time with those mini-things
instead of with me, in our normal-sized life.
(Beat.)
Ha!
Maybe I'II write a..."slam" poem about that
and you can perform it.
(Beat.)
---
## ROBYN:
I've retired from slam poetry.
But you should do it anyway.
---
## SHARON:
I've never written a slam poem before.
(Beat.)
If you're II0 longer a poet
or a potter
what are you?
(A beat.)
(---
## ROBYN:
gets up.)
---
## ROBYN:
It'll probably be bad, all first poems are bad poems. There's a great liberty in being bad.
(She leaves the kitchen.)
(SHARON stares after her, struck to the heart by this wisdom.)
3.
(Night. A week later.)
(---
## ROBYN:
at the kitchen table, done.)
(Her pot plants are set on the window-sill.)
(Very carefully, with immense precision, she rolls ajoint. SHARON comes in, phone in hand.)
---
## ROBYN:
Hey!
---
## SHARON:
(Startled.) Oh!
(Sees.)
I thought you quit.
---
## ROBYN:
It's not tobacco.
---
## SHARON:
(Not kidding.) Then what is it?
(A beat.)
(---
## ROBYN:
looks at her like.• Seriously?)
(A beat.)
(SHARON gets it.)
OH.
You —?
Are those —?
Are those drugs?
---
## ROBYN:
---
## SHARON:

---
## SHARON:
What!
---
## ROBYN:
It's medicinal.
Medicinal herbs.
---
## SHARON:
I thought it was drugs?
---
## ROBYN:
Herbs only become drugs when a capitalist economy gets involved.
---
## SHARON:
Oh.
(A beat. She sits at the kitchen table.)
(She can't help her curiosity.)
---
## SHARON:
Is there some - place - here? VVhere you go? And buy...herbs?
---
## ROBYN:
You mean like a long sticky alley, and a guy with a ski mask is waiting at the end of it?
---
## SHARON:
Is that...?
Is that —!
---
## ROBYN:
No!
I grew these.
(Gestures to the plants.)
I grow my own medicinal herbs, ---
## SHARON:

---
## SHARON:
Those are...?
---
## ROBYN:
I thought you knew. You said you liked them!

## SHARON:
I did Eike them! I thought they were just...weird... plants.
---
## ROBYN:
Oh man, Okay. Well.
(Finishes rolling the joint.)
Outside. Right?
---
## SHARON:
Right.
---
## ROBYN:
Right.
(She gets up.)
(But SHARON isn't ready to be left done.)
---
## SHARON:
I can't get ahold of my son.
---
## ROBYN:
You called him?
---
## SHARON:
I've called. I've been calling.
---
## ROBYN:
It's a Friday night.
---
## SHARON:
I lulow.
---
## ROBYN:
So he's probably out.
---
## SHARON:
I texted him too.
---
## ROBYN:
Is something the matter?
---
## SHARON:
What do you mean?
---
## ROBYN:
Well if it's a Friday night and you're texting him and you're calling him, is something the matter?
(A beat.)
---
## SHARON:
I just think it's a good thing for us to stay in touch.
For a mother and a son to stay in touch.
Don't you?
---
## ROBYN:
Yeah. Yes. I do.
But it might be heiter to stay in touch on a Thursday.
Or in the moming.
You know?
(A beat.)
---
## SHARON:
(Completely unconvineed and kind of upset.) No, sure, of course.
(A beat.)
(---
## ROBYN:
sits back down.)
---
## ROBYN:
Is he dating someone?
---
## SHARON:
Yeah.
I think so?
He doesn't reale
communicate
about that kind of thing.
---
## ROBYN:
Maybe he's out with his boyfriend.
---
## SHARON:
Girlfriend.
---
## ROBYN:
Right, sorry. Straight. You said that.
---
## SHARON:
Just because he's a designer doesn't mean
---
## ROBYN:
You're right, I forgot.
Maybe he's out with his girlfriend, at a nice dinner.
---
## SHARON:
I met her once.
---
## ROBYN:
Thafs nice.
---
## SHARON:
She's a lesbian.
---
## ROBYN:
...Oh?
---
## SHARON:
Not that there's anything wrong with that!!
---
## ROBYN:
How long have they been dating?
---
## SHARON:
A few years.
She's got that short hair.
You know.
We went to brunch and she mentioned an ex-girlfriend.
Apparently they're friends with her ex-girlfriend.
It's all very confusing.
(A beat.)
---
## ROBYN:
I was married to a man.
---
## SHARON:
You were??
---
## ROBYN:
Yeah.
---
## SHARON:
I didn't know that.
---
## ROBYN:
I've only been here a week, why would you know
that?
---
## SHARON:
But then you realized you were gay? And you left
him?
---
## ROBYN:
No, we were in love. And it ended badly. But we
loved each other.
---
## SHARON:
(Amazed and alittle scared.) Are you...a bisexual?
---
## ROBYN:
No. I'm just saying
people find specific words for themselves because it's
easier than not having words.
You know?
But
it doesn't mean those words are all accurate
all the time.
So if she's been with your son for years, she probably
loves him.
Which means, your son probably has lots of people
who love him.
Which is a good thing.
He's probably out right now with people who love him.
And if you call him in the morning, maybe hell tell you
about it.
(A beat.)
(SHARON gets up. She goes to the cupboard, gets out some Johnnie Walker.)
---
## ROBYN:
Ohhh-kay.
---
## SHARON:
You want some?
---
## ROBYN:
I'm okay.
---
## SHARON:
Just a little nighteap.
---
## ROBYN:
I'm sober. But you go ahead.
---
## SHARON:
(Factztally, not mean.) You do drugs.
---
## ROBYN:
I medieate myself with medieinal herbs. But my days with aleohol are over.
(SHARON sits down but doesn'tpour herseif a drink. She studies the joint carefully. ---
## ROBYN:
gets up.)
I'm gonna have a smoke on your poreh and then eall it
a -
---
## SHARON:
(Doesn't want to be left done.) I've never. Smoked that.
---
## ROBYN:
...No?
---
## SHARON:
No.
Not even in college.
I ldssed a -
I told you that.
But drugs? I never.
---
## ROBYN:
Please stop ealling it that. ---
## SHARON:
Sony.
(Beat.)
---
## ROBYN:
Would you like some?
---
## SHARON:
Yes.
Yes please.
---
## ROBYN:
Okay.
(She hesitates, then sits back down. Lights it up. Takes a long drag, then hands it to
---
## SHARON:
)
---
## SHARON:
How do you...?
---
## ROBYN:
You just...like a eigarette.
Have you ever...?
---
## SHARON:
Once.
---
## ROBYN:
Once. Okay. Like that.
Just drag it in deep, and then hold your breath.
---
## SHARON:
This isn't gonna give me cancer, right?
---
## ROBYN:
Nope. No cancer.
---
## SHARON:
Okay.
(She takes a deep drag.)
(Lets it out, coughing a little, bitt...)
---
## ROBYN:
Yeah! Nice.
---
## SHARON:
I don't feel anything.
ROMS. Give it a second.
---
## SHARON:
What am I going to feel?
---
## ROBYN:
Relaxed.
---
## SHARON:
Am I gonna hallucinate?
---
## ROBYN:
No! No. You'll just feel relaxed.
---
## SHARON:
(Getting more tense.) I never feel relaxed. I'm not
a relaxed person. What if I don't feel relaxed? ---
## ROBYN:
You will one hundred percent feel relaxed.
(SHARON takes another drag, just in case.) (Then gives the joint back to ---
## ROBYN:
)
---
## SHARON:
I think my son doesn't like me.
---
## ROBYN:
I'm sure that's not
---
## SHARON:
He loves me. I know he loves me.
But I think he doesn't like me very much.
---
## ROBYN:
Our ldds don't have to like us, they just have to
survive long enough to become us.
---
## SHARON:
Do you have kids?!
(Beat.)
(---
## ROBYN:
passes the joint back to ---
## SHARON:
)
---
## ROBYN:
Your turn.
(Beat. SHARON takes another drag.)
---
## SHARON:
You didn't tell me you --

---
## ROBYN:
---
## SHARON:

---
## SHARON:
Yeah?
(A halfbeat. In heu of saying "shut up":)
---
## ROBYN:
tell me more about your son.
(Half-beat.)
---
## SHARON:
He's very smart.
He's very good-looldng.
I know it's strange for a mother to say that about her
own -
but it's true. He's a very attractive boy.
And I don't know where he gets that from because his
father
Good lord.
That man looked like a potato.
---
## ROBYN:
He probably got it from you.
---
## SHARON:
Me?
No!
Me?
(Beat.)
Do you think I'm good-looldng?
---
## ROBYN:
I think you're pretty, yeah.
---
## SHARON:
Do you mean that in a factual way, or a lesbian
way?
(Halfbeat.)
---
## ROBYN:
I think I need you to make the distinction for me.
---
## SHARON:
Sony. I'm sorry. I said it all wrong.
I just meant
Like, there's a way a man would say to me: you're pretty.
And that would mean I was actually pretty.
And there's a way a woman - a straight woman, I guess
- would say that to me.
And it would mean that she felt sorry for me.
And I don't really know what it means when a lesbian person says that to me because I haven't ever really
known any lesbian people before, except for -
---
## ROBYN:
Your son's girlfriend.
---
## SHARON:
Right.
---
## ROBYN:
Right.
---
## SHARON:
And she didn't like me.
I think she thought I was boring.
And possibly judgmental but I don't think I was judgmental
I didn't feel judgmental I just felt confused. Am I high?
Maybe I think I'm high?
---
## ROBYN:
I think you're just getting relaxed.
Okay. Well.
I said it like: factually, I think you are factually pretty.
And I don't feel sorry for you.
But I'm not hitting on you.
---
## SHARON:
Oh! Thank you.
That's very clean
---
## ROBYN:
Good.
---
## SHARON:
But nuanced.
---
## ROBYN:
Yes.
---
## SHARON:
But now it's clean Thank you.
---
## ROBYN:
You're welcome.
(A beat. They smoke.)
We should turn some music on.
---
## SHARON:
Music?
---
## ROBYN:
Yeah.
No?
---
## SHARON:
I don't really listen to music?
(Beat.)
I have this CD...
My son sent it to me
for Christmas one year
he couldn't come home so
in the mornings rd make breakfast
and just play that CD.
---
## ROBYN:
Let's hear it.
---
## SHARON:
Okay.
Okay!
(She presses "play" on an old CD player nestled on a shelf. Her CD plays - a sentimental song that's SO TERRIBLE, but also, it kind of moves us, in a way we will never admit to later. Possibly Mary Chapin Carpenter.)
(They listen to the CD and get high.)
I've never
you know [smoked pot]
with anyone
I mean obviously because I've never [smoked pot]
but
this is really nice.
No wonder all the ldds do dmgs.
Oops.
Sorry.
Medicinal...
drugs.
---
## ROBYN:
(Laughing.) "All the ldds" don't
---
## SHARON:
Don't they?
---
## ROBYN:
Not all.
---
## SHARON:
Well they should.
All of them maybe should.
Also, I should've been in a band.
---
## ROBYN:
A band!
---
## SHARON:
Were you ever in a band?
I bet you were in a band.
---
## ROBYN:
Sort of, when I was in college.
---
## SHARON:
anew it!!
---
## ROBYN:
I told this girl that I was in a band to impress her. Then she asked me out, and I actually had to be in a band.
(They're laughing together. Then:)
---
## SHARON:
(Very gently.) Where's your child?
---
## ROBYN:
What?
---
## SHARON:
Or children.
(A beat. ---
## ROBYN:
could say anything. Then she gets up, decisively.)
---
## ROBYN:
We need new music.
(She gets her iPhone. She plays some kind of faste; grittier music. Maybe Patti Smith's "Dancing Barefoot.'9
---
## SHARON:
...What is that?
---
## ROBYN:
New music.
(She starts to dance.)
(A beat. SHARON gets up too. She dances.)
(Both women dance in the kitchen, by them-selves, but together.)
4.
(Next day. Küchen.)
(---
## ROBYN:
on the landline.)
(She looks over her shoulder.)
(She doesn't want to be overheard.)
(She takes a deep breath.)
---
## ROBYN:
Halo!
Yes, uh
yes I'm calling for Amanda.
Well
when will she be back?
Oh.
Well.
Did she give you any sort of
ball-park idea of -
No no
that's okay
I'll just
I'll try again.
(She hangs up. A beat.)
(A deep breath. Resolvel)
(She picks up the phone again. Dias.)
IE. Yes. I'm calling back.
Yes, for Amanda.
Yes I know you said that
but we both know she told you to say that
and right nm she's there
standing behind you
and you're darting her kind of wide-eyed looks
like WHAT DO I DO ABOUT THIS
and she's shaking her head
and biting her fingemails
so you know what
I do want to leave a message.
You tell my daughter that I'm doing it.
She thinks I can't do it but I'm doing it.
I'm in Iowa
of all places
so.
That's all.
I'm going to hang up now.
(---
## ROBYN:
hangs up.)
(A beat. Another deep breath.) (She goes out on the porch.) (SHARON enters the kitchen.) (She doesn't see ---
## ROBYN:
at first.) (She calls her son.)
(lt goes to voicemail.)
---
## SHARON:
Hiii
it's me
your mother
um
it's Saturday moming
I just wanted to make sure you got home okay
from wherever you were
whatever you were doing
with whoever it was
(Beat.)
Also are you still dating that lesbian girl?
(Beat.)
It's okay if you are
(Beat.)
You should visit me!
(Beat.)
Also, I just have been thinking
maybe you don't tell me enough things
about your life
and
maybe you don't want to tell me
(which I guess is okay.)
(although I don't know why you wouldn't.)
but I do want to know.
Because
care.
So.
(Beat - this comes bursting out of her.)
smoked marijuana last night.
(A frozen moment; she's shocked at herself)
Goodbye.
(She hangs up. A beat.)
(---
## ROBYN:
comes in from the porch.)
(Startled.) Oh!
---
## ROBYN:
Just me, again.
---
## SHARON:
Good morning.
---
## ROBYN:
Morning.
---
## SHARON:
How'd you sleep?
---
## ROBYN:
Good. You?
---
## SHARON:
(Finds this to be true, as she says it.) Really good.
(A warm beat between them.)
Coffee?
---
## ROBYN:
I'd love some.
---
## SHARON:
Okay!
(The phone rings. They both freeze. Then both move to it.)
---
## ROBYN:
Fes / for me.
---
## SHARON:
Oh god.
(Beat - ---
## ROBYN:
is quizzicak)
---
## SHARON:
I mean, go on.
---
## ROBYN:
(Answers the phone.) Hello?
(It's Sharon's son.)
Oh!
Uh. Hello. IE.
Oh, this is ---
## ROBYN:
your mother's roommate.
Yeah, nice to meet you as well.
Yeah, your mom is -
(On a sudden whim, SHARON starts shaking her head frantically. ---
## ROBYN:
pauses, startled. Head-shaking continues.)
Your mom is not
available
right now.
(Beat.)
Yeah she's busy.
(Beat.)
No, I don't know what she's doing, I just know she's...
(SHARON gestures emphatically: OUT.)
OUT. She. Is OUT. Right now.
What?
Well I guess she must've stepped out right after she called you.
(Beat - he's asking her something.)
Marijuana?
Your mother?
I have no idea.
You'll have to ask her that.
Okay.
Okay.
You too.
(---
## ROBYN:
hangs up.)
(A beat. Co-conspirators. Then:)
You told him you smoked pot?
---
## SHARON:
I didn't mean to
I meant to say something eise
some bullshit Mom thing
stay safe, be eareful, don't ride the subway at night
and then I said that. Instead.
(Beat.)
---
## ROBYN:
He sounds nice.
---
## SHARON:
He does?
---
## ROBYN:
Yeah.
He had a nice voice.
(Beat.)
---
## SHARON:
I'm always home in the mornings.
He's going to ask where I was.
---
## ROBYN:
(Shrugs.) You were out.
---
## SHARON:
I don't really go out.
---
## ROBYN:
(Teasing her.) But I hear there's poetry elasses and
hot yoga and
---
## SHARON:
- Okay okay -
---
## ROBYN:
Cultural [things]
---
## SHARON:
I go to the book elub.
And the store. On Thursdays.
---
## ROBYN:
The store?
---
## SHARON:
I work at a gift shop. Just on Thursdays. It's nice.
Maybe I'll say I went in today as well. Early.
---
## ROBYN:
tell him you were on a date.
---
## SHARON:
Wh,at?
---
## ROBYN:
Yeah. A date.
---
## SHARON:
N0000
A-!
On a Saturday morning?
---
## ROBYN:
Breakfast date.
---
## SHARON:
Oh man.
---
## ROBYN:
You met him online. He asked you to breakfast. What.
---
## SHARON:
Online?
---
## ROBYN:
Don't tell me you never...
(She sees SHARON hasn't.)
You never?
---
## SHARON:
There are serial killers online.
---
## ROBYN:
Oh my god.
Time-out. Time.
You have never been on an intemet date.
---
## SHARON:
No!! Have you??
---
## ROBYN:
Yes!
---
## SHARON:
Oh!
(Beat.)
There aren't any women serial killers though. So that's different.
---
## ROBYN:
When was the last time you were on a date?
---
## SHARON:
When I got married! And we all saw how well that turned out!
---
## ROBYN:
Okay.
Okay.
We have to remedy this.
---
## SHARON:
No we don't. Nope.
---
## ROBYN:
---
## SHARON:
You have to stop thinking about yourself
as basieally dead.
You are aetually younger than most U.S. presidents.
You are young enough that, if you were a president, you would be a young president.
Okay?
So just. Stop mummifying yourself.
(A beat. This strikes SHARON all the way to the heart. After a moment:)
---
## SHARON:
I'd go on a date if you went.
---
## ROBYN:
VVhat! Oh no no no
---
## SHARON:
Like a double
---
## ROBYN:
I am not going on your date with you!
---
## SHARON:
Like a double-date, what
---
## ROBYN:
Awkward! That shit was awkward in college, it's awkward now!
---
## SHARON:
Someone with a sister
---
## ROBYN:
No! No no
---
## SHARON:
We could all get coffee together
---
## ROBYN:
No! I will help screen the applicants so that you do not find yourself sitting across from a seHal Idller, but I'm not gonna come along and have coffee with his sister!
---
## SHARON:
You'd help me screen them?
'WEM. Yeah I could do that.
---
## SHARON:
I don't know how to set up a...page. A home page.
---
## ROBYN:
A profile.
I could help you do that.
---
## SHARON:
How come you know all these things? (A beat.)
---
## ROBYN:
I used to run a lot of businesses.
---
## SHARON:
You did?
---
## ROBYN:
Yeah.
---
## SHARON:
What kind of businesses?
---
## ROBYN:
Businesses that helped people with personal things.
---
## SHARON:
I didn't know that.
---
## ROBYN:
We're just getting to know each other. There's a lot you don't know.
---
## SHARON:
(Doesn't mean to say this.) I'm glad you're here, ---
## ROBYN:

(---
## ROBYN:
is moved, and this makes her awkward. A beat. Then:)
---
## ROBYN:
I'll just...
I forgot my glasses.
(She leaves the ?vom.)
(A beat. SHARON drinks ceree.)
(The phone rings. SHARON considers.)
(She considers. She sighs.)
(SHARON picks it up.)
---
## SHARON:
Hi.
(Beat; it's not her son.)
Excuse me?
No, this is ---
## SHARON:
Who's calling please?
Amanda, I think you have the wrong number.
No, there isn't anyone here by that name.
Victoria, there's no Victoria -
What?
No, I'm not...
I just said, there's no Victoria here.
You have the wrong number, dear.
What do you mean she just called you from -
(A beat.)
I don't know what to tell you.
I have to go.
(SHARON hangs up.)
(She sits for a second.)
(She opens her mouth.)
(She closes it.)
(A beat.)
(---
## ROBYN:
returns.)
---
## ROBYN:
Did I hear the phone?
---
## SHARON:
lt was
just
my son.
Calling back.
---
## ROBYN:
You picked up?
---
## SHARON:
I told him
I couldn't talk.
I was going on a date.
5.
(Later that morning.)
(The porch. ---
## ROBYN:
s boxes still stacked.)
(SHARON goes through her things.)
(She doesn't know exactly what she's looking
for, but she knows there's something.)
---
## SHARON:
(Reading the box labeis.) Kitchen supplies odds and ends
books
okay
cook books
really?
you don't cook
I've never seen you
winter clothes
okay
Antiques
I like Antiques
clothes
(She opens the clothing box.)
(Looks at ---
## ROBYN:
s clothes. Takes them out.)
(Beat.)
(Beat.)
(Puts on a hat.)
(Beat.)
(Puts on ajacket.)
(Models.)
(She tries on ---
## ROBYN:
s clothes. She feels power-ful in them.)
(She moves around the porch in them.)
(Clears her throat. Sort of as Robym)
I'm a poet.
I write poems.
Here's a poem.
(Silently pretends to recite The Best Poem That Has Ever Been Written.)
Thank you.
Thank you.
An autogTaph?
Oh my.
I suppose I could.
(SHARON keeps going through the clothing box. Then: she double-takes.)
Oh.
(She reaches in. She pulls out a fistful of driver's licenses. Beat. Anotherfistful. She reads the names, dropping them back into the box.)
Claire Jones.
Claire Doyle.
Sarah Lucas.
Victoria Lucas.
---
## ROBYN:
Doyle.
Victoria Jones.
(Beat. More fisuls of driver's licenses, she drops them back without reading them, beat.)
Oh.
6.
(Evening.)
(SHARON sits at the kitchen table.)
(She waits for ---
## ROBYN:
to get home.)
(Key in the lock.)
(---
## ROBYN:
enters.)
---
## ROBYN:
Oh!
Hey!
---
## SHARON:
IE.
---
## ROBYN:
How was your day?
---
## SHARON:
Good
how was yours?
---
## ROBYN:
I went to the Farmer's Market on
what is that street
the one with the parldng garage
---
## SHARON:
Gilbert
---
## ROBYN:
Yeah, Gilbert! I bought a necklace
there was this woman selling these necklaces she'd
made
out of hemp I think, she grew it herseif, and these clay beads,
do you know who I'm talldng about? Is she maybe in your book club or something?
---
## SHARON:
How come you have so many driver's licenses? (A real beat.)
---
## ROBYN:
Excuse me?
---
## SHARON:
I asked how come -?
---
## ROBYN:
Did you go through my stuff??
---
## SHARON:
I was looldng for
a hat
---
## ROBYN:
A hat?
---
## SHARON:
My head was
cold.
---
## ROBYN:
A hat in my stuffl
---
## SHARON:
lt said "clothes."
I thought, maybe ---
## ROBYN:
hos a hat.
---
## ROBYN:
Okay.
Wow.
---
## SHARON:
I'm sorry.
I don't mean it like...
you shouldn't have a hundred driver's licenses
but also
why do you have them?
---
## ROBYN:
Because.
Because I do. I collect them.
---
## SHARON:
They're all you, but with different names.
---
## ROBYN:
Right.
---
## SHARON:
And different addresses and different birthdays.
---
## ROBYN:
I mean did you examine every single one?
---
## SHARON:
Who's Amanda?
(A real beat.)
---
## ROBYN:
Did she call?
---
## SHARON:
Yeah.
She asked for Victoria.
Who is she?
---
## ROBYN:
Is this twenty questions? Are we doing the
roommate get-to-know-you thing, or is this twenty
questions, or is this an interrogation?
---
## SHARON:
I'm not interrogating --

---
## ROBYN:
Do you want me to leave?
---
## SHARON:
I'm not asking you to leave!
(Beat.)
Should I be asldng you to leave?
(Beat.)
---
## ROBYN:
No.
(Beat.)
---
## SHARON:
Then I'm not.
(Beat.)
Are you hungry?
---
## ROBYN:
Am I...?
---
## SHARON:
No dairy. No meat. I made vegetables.
---
## ROBYN:
What did you make?
---
## SHARON:
I just kind of cut them up and cooked them. I
don't know.
You don't have to...
---
## ROBYN:
I'll try some.
(Beat. SHARON gets her a bowl of vegetables.) (They sit. Eventually)
Have you talked to anyone about this?
---
## SHARON:
"This"?
---
## ROBYN:
This
me
this
---
## SHARON:
No!
VVho would I -?
No
---
## ROBYN:
Okay.
---
## SHARON:
What should I not be telling people?
---
## ROBYN:
Nothing. There's nothing to not-tell.
I came here for some peace and quiet.
---
## SHARON:
Look, I'm not trying to
I don't mean to
I like you
(This surprises them both, greatly.) (A beat.)
What I mean is
it's nice
to have a friend.
---
## ROBYN:
Are we friends?
---
## SHARON:
Aren% we?
---
## ROBYN:
I thought we were roommates.
House, housemates
---
## SHARON:
We are.
But
then you got me high so
now we're friends.
(A beat. Amused despite herselfi)
---
## ROBYN:
Is that how it works?
---
## SHARON:
That's how it seems to work when the kids do it.
---
## ROBYN:
(Laughs, then sobers.) All right
if we're friends
don't go through my shit.
---
## SHARON:
I didn't mean to
---
## ROBYN:
Yeah I know you wanted a hat
if you want a hat, buy a damn hat
---
## SHARON:
Okay
(Beat.)
Is Amanda your daughter?
---
## ROBYN:
Jesus Christ.
---
## SHARON:
I'm very nosy and I'm very persistent
it's something that hos always irritated my son
but inescapable, in our line of work
---
## ROBYN:
(Alarmed.) Line of work!
---
## SHARON:
Being a mother?
(Beat.)
---
## ROBYN:
Yes.
---
## SHARON:
Yes?
---
## ROBYN:
Yes.
You are correct.
Amanda is my daughter.
Yes.
---
## SHARON:
Oh.
(Beat.)
What's your name actually?
---
## ROBYN:
---
## ROBYN:

---
## SHARON:
But... Victoria? And Clare? And...?
---
## ROBYN:
Those were also my names, actually, when they were actually my names.
---
## SHARON:
But what were you born as?
---
## ROBYN:
I was born os a malleable, changeable template.
(Beat.)
---
## SHARON:
Is that a poem?
---
## ROBYN:
No.
(Beat.)
---
## SHARON:
I guess what I'm asldng is,
Are you doing something illegal?
---
## ROBYN:
Right now?
---
## SHARON:
Or like...recently.
Or...ongoingly.
Or like...were you?
(A beat.)
---
## ROBYN:
Yes.
Yes I was, ---
## SHARON:

---
## SHARON:
Oh!
(A beat.)
What was it?
---
## ROBYN:
If you ask me that
and I tell you
it makes you an accomplice
So.
(Beat.)
---
## SHARON:
(Trying the word out.) An accomplice.
(Beat.)
What did you do?
---
## ROBYN:
---
## SHARON:

---
## SHARON:
Yeah?
---
## ROBYN:
I'm going to go outside and have a cigarette.
And you think about whether or not you want me to answer that.
And when I come back, you can ask it again.
Or
we can finish dinner
and make an online dating profile for you,
and go to bed
and tomorrow will be a whole new day
in which this question does not exist.
(She gets up and starts to leave to the porch.)
---
## SHARON:
Are you really gonna quit smoldng, or is that like
part of this whole
multiple personality thing?
---
## ROBYN:
I, as me, as myself, am going to quit
as soon os I have this next, last,
cigarette.
(---
## ROBYN:
goes outside.)
(A beat.)
(SHARON wants to do so many things0
(She gets up she sits down she gets up she
opens her mouth she sits down she goes to the
phone checking nervously over her shoulder.)
(---
## ROBYN:
isn't looking.)
(She calls her son.)
(Voicemail0
(She has no idea what she's going to say.)
(She SOrt of listens to herself stumble through
the usual set of communications, while wondering ifshe's going to tell him what's
happening:)
---
## SHARON:
Hi
it's me
your mother
um
I just wanted to see how you're doing!
I just
am thinking about you and
I think you should visit.
I think we should visit each other.
When I told you I smoked marijuana?
I was kidding.
• •
I went on a date.
Actually, I wasn't kidding.
I did smoke marijuana•
But I'm not smoldng it right now.
• •
I didn't go on a date.
I did go on a date.
•••
My roommate is very
she's very
there's something very
about her
the thing is
• •
she's an interesting person.
(SHARON is so surprised! She didn't expeet to say thisl But it's true.)
She knows things.
She does things.
Everybody always told me not to do things.
Your father never [understood me]
And my mother! She always said Don't.
Is that how you feel about me?
Am I a person who says to you: Don't?
(Beat - maybe she doesn't want that answered.) ---
## ROBYN:
just says: Do. And then she does.
(The voicemail cuts her off)
Are you there?
Are you...?
Oh.
(She calls back, voicemaild
Your machine cut me off.
won't keep you too long.
just wanted to say that
I'm very
happy
and
that's all.
Goodbye.
(She hangs up.)
(---
## ROBYN:
is standing in the doorway.)
(A beat between them.)
---
## ROBYN:
I finished my eigarette.
---
## SHARON:
(With real resolve.) What do you do, ---
## ROBYN:

---
## ROBYN:
Did.
---
## SHARON:
What did you do?
(A beat. Okay.)
---
## ROBYN:
I took people's money.
---
## SHARON:
Like. You robbed them?
---
## ROBYN:
Yes.
---
## SHARON:
You mugged them?
---
## ROBYN:
No. I convinced them to grive me their money.
---
## SHARON:
That doesn't sound illegal.
---
## ROBYN:
Under false pretenses.
I called them up. Old people. Mostly.
They could donate to save the whales or the orphans or the ozone layer. Whatever.
And they did.
And it all went to me.
---
## SHARON:
(Horrified...but also impressed.) You did that?
---
## ROBYN:
Yeah.
But that wasn't enough money.
So then I started telling people they'd won things.
People are a lot more willing to risk when there's tangible reward.
And to collect the prize, they'd have to provide information.
---
## SHARON:
Are you the Nigerians?
---
## ROBYN:
Sorry?
---
## SHARON:
All those emails from Princess what'sit trying to store her millions in my whatever -
were those actually from you?
---
## ROBYN:
Oh! No. I'm much more detail-oriented. Precise. Grammatic.
---
## SHARON:
But that's the general idea.
---
## ROBYN:
That's the general idea, yes.
(A beat as SHARON takes this all in.)
Do you want me to stop telling you?
---
## SHARON:
No,
go on.
---
## ROBYN:
...So that happened for a while.
And it was actually substantially lucrative.
---
## SHARON:
VVhat about your daughter??
Did she know?
---
## ROBYN:
We teach our children whatever sldll-sets we have, ---
## SHARON:
Didn't you?
---
## SHARON:
You taught your daughter how to seam people?
---
## ROBYN:
She's the one who came up with the driver's license thing.
We started manufacturing fake IDs, and then she'd seil them at school.
But that wasn't until college.
---
## SHARON:
Your daughter is a con-artist?
---
## ROBYN:
My daughter is an intelligent and resourceful young woman.
(A beat.)
---
## SHARON:
I don't know.
---
## ROBYN:
What.
---
## SHARON:
What you said...before.
I don't know if I gave my son any kind of...
sIdll-set.
---
## ROBYN:
He sounds successful.
---
## SHARON:
I think he might have done that on his own. Or, worse, in spite of me.
We're not dose.
Why aren't we dose?
---
## ROBYN:
Well. Amanda and I aren't dose either.
---
## SHARON:
You scammed people together.
You were con-artists together.
You were like Bonnie and Clyde, but mother and daughter.
That's so... I don't know! Close!
---
## ROBYN:
We have to give our ldds things, and they have to
reject those things.
At some point.
Amanda temps at a law firm now and she wears these little power-suits
and she tells everybody that her mother lives in another country
so all of her boyfriends bring her home for the holidays
and their mothers are extra sympathetic because her own is
so far away.
So.
(A beat.)
---
## SHARON:
I'm sorry.
---
## ROBYN:
It's fine.
---
## SHARON:
It's not fine.
(Beat.)
---
## ROBYN:
She doesn't think I can give it up. The lifestyle. She doesn't want to talk to me anymore, but if she talked to me, she'd see that I can give it up. I mean, I'm in Iowa. Talk about giving up.
---
## SHARON:
(Hey.)
---
## ROBYN:
Also, I sold pot. But you probably figured that out already.
---
## SHARON:
(Wide-eyed.) No, I didn't.
---
## ROBYN:
You didn't?
---
## SHARON:
No! How would I figrure that out??
---
## ROBYN:
(Genuinely impressed.) Wow. What planet are you from?
---
## SHARON:
Iowa?
---
## ROBYN:
Wow. Iowa.
---
## SHARON:
Actually Illinois, though.
---
## ROBYN:
Right. I remember.
---
## SHARON:
Not (rillte the Land of Giving Up.
---
## ROBYN:
I was
talldng about me, not you
maybe also you, but mostly me.
---
## SHARON:
You sold pot?
---
## ROBYN:
Not too often. Just because I don't really have a grow-house or anything.
And growing pot for real, that's a commitment, it requires a lot of specifics.
But I have definitely sold it. And that has also, sporadically, definitely been lucrative.
---
## SHARON:
Did Amanda seil pot?
---
## ROBYN:
(With some pride.) She paid her way through college.
---
## SHARON:
Wow.
---
## ROBYN:
(Reallyproucl.) And she has a green thumb, I mean I'm not bad with plants but she's got a real talent. Yeah.
---
## SHARON:
(Impressed.) That's great.
---
## ROBYN:
lt is.
(Beat.)
She refuses to talk about any of that now.
VVhen we talk, which is not often, she wants to keep things "present-tense."
She says her therapist told her to do that.
And I'm like, what kind of a therapist refuses to speak in the past tense?
Things happened. They accumulated. We became. Or the future, for that matter. We will become.
But no. Amanda says, "Today I am eating a sandwich. I am grrocery shopping."
She says, "We are avoiding conflict."
(Half-beat.)
I don't think conflict is a bad thing.
---
## SHARON:
You know my son does that too
the present-tense thing
I don't know if anybody told him to do it
But III be like, "Remember when I visited you and we had fun?"
And hell be like, "It's sunny today. It's cloudy today."
(A contemplative beat, then:)
What eise did you do?
---
## ROBYN:
I mean, I did just a little bit of auto-theft, but
---
## SHARON:
YOU WHAT.
---
## ROBYN:
(With growingpride.) But it's a lot of work
high risk
you have to be really really good at it
and that takes time
like a real commitment to craft
---
## SHARON:
Okay yeah I mean yeah I imagrine
---
## ROBYN:
And you have to spend real time building the right
networks
and people have to trust you
if you're going to buy stolen property you have to trust
the seller
---
## SHARON:
Sure okay
---
## ROBYN:
And I was good
buyers trusted me
and you might not know this from looldng of me but
I'm very very good with cars
both jacldng them and stripping them down
some people don't do well under pressure and
I don't want to brag, but I would say that I sort of
thrive
in those contexts
but
finally in the end
auto-theft just ended up not being time-cost effective.
You know?
---
## SHARON:
Right!
...Why not?
---
## ROBYN:
...Well
because we moved a lot, we had to move a lot
so you build a network of buyers and then you abandon
it,
sort of before you've closed the deal.
lt becomes wasteful. And ultimately too risky•
---
## SHARON:
Are people chasing you?
---
## ROBYN:
Right now?
---
## SHARON:
Yes, Hght now!
---
## ROBYN:
I don't think they are right now, no.
---
## SHARON:
You don't think?
---
## ROBYN:
I'm fairly certain that right now nobody is chasing
me.
---
## SHARON:
How certain?
---
## ROBYN:
Fairly.
(A beat.)
---
## SHARON:
Are you doing something right now? Here?
---
## ROBYN:
I just got here.
---
## SHARON:
(A real question.) Are you scamming me?
---
## ROBYN:
You?
---
## SHARON:
Me.
---
## ROBYN:
You haven't given me any money! How am I
scamming you?
---
## SHARON:
I don't know, I don't know if you are
I'm just asking.
---
## ROBYN:
Do you feel like I'm scamming you?
---
## SHARON:
I mean I don't know
Maybe my jewefry is missing or
maybe you've photocopied my credit cards or something
Have you?
I don't know
Have you?
---
## ROBYN:
No.
---
## SHARON:
No?
---
## ROBYN:
No. I have not.
---
## SHARON:
Promise?
---
## ROBYN:
I mean, I promise but
do you believe me?
(Beat. SHARON looks at her. Then0
---
## SHARON:
Yeah.
---
## ROBYN:
Yeah?
---
## SHARON:
I do believe you. Yes.
(Beat between them.)
---
## ROBYN:
So that's me.
(Beat.)
Are you having a nervous breakdown?
(Beat.)
---
## SHARON:
Show me how to do it.
---
## ROBYN:
What?
---
## SHARON:
I want to do it.
What you did.
---
## ROBYN:
No!
---
## SHARON:
Why not?
---
## ROBYN:
Because...!
---
## SHARON:
Because what?
---
## ROBYN:
Because I'm done with all that.
---
## SHARON:
I'm not asking you to do it, just to show me how.
(A real beat.)
(---
## ROBYN:
takes her in. Then:)
---
## ROBYN:
Show you how what, exactly?
---
## SHARON:
The phone thing.
---
## ROBYN:
I don't do the phone thing anymore.
---
## SHARON:
I bet rd be good, talldng to somebody on the phone.
---
## ROBYN:
I don't do any of this anymore.
---
## SHARON:
Like you don't smoke anymore?
(Beat.)
---
## ROBYN:
That's not fair.
---
## SHARON:
I'm sorry.
---
## ROBYN:
Those are entirely different things.
---
## SHARON:
I know.
You're right, I know.
Look. All I'm saying is
how
exactly
did you do it -
when you did it
(which you no longer do)?
(Beat.)
---
## ROBYN:
Well.
There's a few ways.
Either you're asking them for something
or you're telling them something.
---
## SHARON:
Okay...
---
## ROBYN:
Like, maybe you're telling them that something
they value is about to expire.
Auto insurance. Home insurance. Their cable. Whatever.
And you have a deal, and it's kind of an amazing one-time deal, but it's ending in twenty-four hours. You
just caught them at the tail end of this deal.
---
## SHARON:
Right.
---
## ROBYN:
So they better decide fast if they want to save sixty percent on their phone bill.
Or upgrade to a new twice-as-fast high-speed internet connection.
---
## SHARON:
That sounds easy. I could do that.
---
## ROBYN:
But you also have to be personable, keep them on
the line until you get their credit card.
It's easy to hang up a phone.
---
## SHARON:
I'm personable.
---
## ROBYN:
It's harder than you think.
---
## SHARON:
lt doesn't sound that hard.
---
## ROBYN:
Oh really!
Ring ring. I'm gonna pick up.
(She “pieks up.")
Hello?
---
## SHARON:
Wait, are we pretending?
---
## ROBYN:
(We're seeing how good you are)
Hello, who is this?
---
## SHARON:
This is ---
## SHARON:

---
## ROBYN:
I don't know any Sharons.
---
## SHARON:
My name is Sharon, and I'm calling about your...
uh
your
life insurance.
Which is about to expire.
---
## ROBYN:
lt is?
---
## SHARON:
(Helpfully.) You are about to expire.
---
## ROBYN:
Let's start with something easier.
You're calling me about my cable bill. Isn't it high?
Wouldn't I like it to be lower?
---
## SHARON:
Isn't it high?
---
## ROBYN:
I guess it is a little...
---
## SHARON:
Wouldn't you like it to be lower?
---
## ROBYN:
Are you trying to seil me something?
(They get suspicious.)
Are you trying to seil me something I don't want,
Sharon?
---
## SHARON:
I'm calling because
there's a deal and it's about to end
and you're lucky, you are a lucky person
because first of all, there aren't that many deals in life
life is mostly about being charged the full amount
and second of all, timing is ever3rthing.
A bullet is a bullet and your head is your head and
if two seconds separate those things
well
those two seconds saved your life.
So.
How would you like to pay less for your cable?
(A beat. ---
## ROBYN:
is actually impressed.)
---
## ROBYN:
rd like that a lot.
---
## SHARON:
Okay!
Well that's good.
I'd like that too.
Give me your credit card.
---
## ROBYN:
(Make that sound more official. Anything about money has to sound official, so they feel safe.)
---
## SHARON:
Please give me your credit card.
---
## ROBYN:
(Breaks the "call.'9 "The next step requires your
date of birth and your credit card information."
You don't need it, it is required.
---
## SHARON:
You are good at this.
---
## ROBYN:
Yeah, I am, I'm very good at it.
---
## SHARON:
How did I do?
---
## ROBYN:
Generally? You did okay generally
---
## SHARON:
Okay?
---
## ROBYN:
You did pretty okay.
---
## SHARON:
I was good.
You know I was good.
---
## ROBYN:
You were pretty good.
---
## SHARON:
I was personable. And you liked me. (Half-beat.)
---
## ROBYN:
Yeah.
Yes. You were.
---
## SHARON:
You did, didn't you.
---
## ROBYN:
Yeah, I liked you.
(A moment between them.)
(The air has sheed suddenly and they both suddenly frei it, and neither is sure what the
shift is. They're both suddenly uneasy.)
So. That was that.
---
## SHARON:
I want to do it for real.
---
## ROBYN:
---
## SHARON:
..
---
## SHARON:
I could do it for real, couldn't I.
(A beat.)
---
## ROBYN:
I...can't.
Not anymore.
---
## SHARON:
You can't? Or you don't want to?
Or you want to, but you think you shouldn't?
(A beat.)
---
## ROBYN:
I'm going to bed.
So.
---
## SHARON:
Look.
Tomorrow I make one phone can.
Okay? Just one. With you.
And if it doesn't go well, then forget it!
I wasn't cut out for it! Well forget it!
It'll be like it never happened.
But if it goes well
then
you see how you feel about that.
(A beat.)
---
## ROBYN:
---
## SHARON:
..
---
## SHARON:
One foot in the grave, who would I even tell.
---
## ROBYN:
Sharon, I told you, you are not old.
---
## SHARON:
I didn't feel old. Just now.
I felt like
I was thriving
and I bet you did too.
(A beat.)
---
## ROBYN:
Good night.
(She leaves.)
7.
(Morning. The kitchen.)
(Cojfee. Light. French.)
(...French?)
(Yes, SHARON is listening to a French lan-guage tape as she makes coffee.)
FRENCH TAPE. (Recording.) Ithp6tez s'il vous platt.
Je m'appelle...
---
## SHARON:
Je m'appelle ---
## SHARON:

FRENCH TAPE. (Recording.) Comment-allez vous?
---
## SHARON:
Comment-allez vous?
FRENCH TAPE. (Recording.) J'aime Paris.
---
## SHARON:
J'aime Paris.
(---
## ROBYN:
in the doorway.)
---
## ROBYN:
Wh,at are you doing.
---
## SHARON:
Parlez-vous Frainais?
---
## ROBYN:
Not to any functional degree, non.
Why are you parlez-ing Frainais?
---
## SHARON:
I always wanted to learn.
---
## ROBYN:
You did?
---
## SHARON:
In college I was a member of the French club.
---
## ROBYN:
I didn't know that.
---
## SHARON:
I was going to be a spy. La Femme ---
## SHARON:

Or a baket
...Coffee?
---
## ROBYN:
Yes please.
(SHARON gets her coffee.)
---
## SHARON:
So...
---
## ROBYN:
Yeah?
---
## SHARON:
Have you
you know.
thought about it?
---
## ROBYN:
"Je_
---
## SHARON:
You know...
---
## ROBYN:
Ijust woke up.
---
## SHARON:
I know, I made you coffee.
---
## ROBYN:
So give it a minute, okay?
---
## SHARON:
Okay.
(She sits and watches ---
## ROBYN:
drink her coffee.)
(With balefulfocus.)
(Like an iguana.)
---
## ROBYN:
Do you mind.
---
## SHARON:
What.
---
## ROBYN:
You're watching me.
---
## SHARON:
I'm drinking my coffee.
---
## ROBYN:
You are not drinidng your coffee
you are watching me.
(SHARON lifis her coffee cup to her mouth.)
(She gives ---
## ROBYN:
an iguana-stare over the lip of the mug.)
Did you sleep?
---
## SHARON:
Yeah I slept
---
## ROBYN:
Because I heard
French
around five a.m ?

---
## SHARON:
How did you know who to target?
---
## ROBYN:
"Targee I don't use that word "target”
---
## SHARON:
Okay...
---
## ROBYN:
"Identify," I took some time to identify my dient base
---
## SHARON:
Okay...
So like...
---
## ROBYN:
Northemers are mean and paranoid
Southemers are nice but suspicious
The west coast is in a state of anarchy
---
## SHARON:
And Iowa?
---
## ROBYN:
The Midwest is always good.
(Beat.)
---
## SHARON:
We could can Tanya.
---
## ROBYN:
Tanya.
---
## SHARON:
She's from Idaho.
---
## ROBYN:
Your friend Tanya?
---
## SHARON:
She's an acquaintance.
---
## ROBYN:
You want to target Tanya.
---
## SHARON:
I am identifying our best dient base.
(---
## ROBYN:
really takes SHARON in. Really in.) ---
## ROBYN:
You're a quick study.
---
## SHARON:
(This compliment means a lot to her.) My mother always said I was slow.
---
## ROBYN:
(Not meanly.) Your mother was a bitch, I think. ---
## SHARON:
(Startled, not upset.) Excuse me?
---
## ROBYN:
(Still not mean.) I mean it's hard to tell, it was an earlier time,
sometimes you think: that's just how women were taught to be
but it sounds like your mother was kind of a bitch.
---
## SHARON:
I don't feel comfortable saying that myself but I really appreciate that you said it.
beat.)
---
## ROBYN:
You'd have to disguise your voice.
An accent of some kind.
---
## SHARON:
I think I could do French.
---
## ROBYN:
Convincingly?
---
## SHARON:
Tanya is from _Nah°.
---
## ROBYN:
If this goes badly, I never agreed to it.
---
## SHARON:
Understood.
(She goes to the phone. She dials Tanya.)
(---
## ROBYN:
sits, armsfolded, a commanding gen-eral surveying the troops. SHARON blossoms
under her undivided attention. In the follow-ing sequence, we see SHARON come fully alive. In a French accent:)
---
## SHARON:
Hello?
Yes, is this Tanya?
Tanya, hello, this is
Juliette
DuBois
from The Franco-Global Association for International
Orphans
based in Normandy, France
Yes
Normandy is a lovely city
there are stone walls and it is right next to the ocean
and long ago people stormed the beaches with great passion
(---
## ROBYN:
clears her throat.)
which is all to say
I wonder if you are interested in saving the lives of
starving children
orphans, oui, orphans
in Senegal
in many places, but specifically Senegal
have you been?
It's lovely
the bright colors, the drums, the hats
yes, Senegal is a place of music and motion and hats
and children without parents
- What?
Well
what we do is, we provide orphans with things they generally lack
like pain au chocolat
and bicycles
and vegetables
and small hats
and the right Idnds of love.
And love requires money.
All kinds of love, but especially the right Idnds.
There can be no love of any Idnds
without money.
(Beat - this comes from a personalplace.)
(SHARON thinks about her life as she speaks, and she gets emotional, and it's actually weirdly honest and raw.)
Think about what it is to be alone.
lt is a late night somewhere
wherever you are
and you are alone.
Think about the objects you arrange around you.
But everything is cold under your hand.
And then someone comes into your life.
And you become different.
You find yourself to be...truly...alive.
Think about how one person can change an entire lifetime
of accumulated coldness and objects and silence.

## ROBYN:
speaking with a quiet and inarguable victory)
Thank you Tanya.
It's people like you who make the difference. The next step requires your date of birth and your credit card information.
8.
(The kucken, two weeks Wer.)
(The table is cluttered, piled high with French guidebooks, a stack of new clothes with labels still on, scattered cash, cigarettes. And...a record player. lt looks like the kitchen of high-rolling and sophisticated college kids with money to bum.)
(---
## ROBYN:
at the table, bagging weed.)
(SHARON is on the cordless phone with a book-club lady. She looks younger, somehow, more buoyant.)
---
## SHARON:
(To the phone.) Yes, how much would you like?
Now, was that the herbal mix or the baked goods?
Okay dear, I'll bring it to book club tomorrow. Bye bye now.
(She hangs up.)
That's another order.
---
## ROBYN:
Boom!
Of the brownies, or...?
---
## SHARON:
The herbal mix.
---
## ROBYN:
(Makes a note in a notebook.) Got it. They're being discreet?
---
## SHARON:
Like little mice
little Iowan church mice
but I must say, it livens up reading group discussion.
Everybody's got opinions now,
they all interrupt each other.
These days Tanya giggles a lot
we read that book about child soldiers and she just
giggled her way through that.
---
## ROBYN:
(Laughing.) Was that one your pick?
---
## SHARON:
I told you -
---
## ROBYN:
You're not from here.
---
## SHARON:
/ played the claHnet os a child.
Tanya refers to her book club os a -
SHARON & ---
## ROBYN:
- Reading group.
---
## SHARON:
I seem Iowan, but I'm not Iowan, it's my secret
weapon.
---
## ROBYN:
Yeah I'm learning that about you.
---
## SHARON:
What?
---
## ROBYN:
Your secret weapons.
(A beat between them.)
---
## SHARON:
(Pleased.) You're the one who came home yesterday
with a record player.
---
## ROBYN:
You're the one who never listens to music
lt was an act of mercy on my part
---
## SHARON:
I like it.
The record player.
---
## ROBYN:
(Shy.) Yeah?
---
## SHARON:
Yeah.
---
## ROBYN:
Cool.
(Beat.)
---
## SHARON:
---
## ROBYN:

---
## ROBYN:
Yeah?
---
## SHARON:
I was gonna ask you...
---
## ROBYN:
What's up?
---
## SHARON:
Well
I had this idea
this thought
that I wanted to sort of
run by you
---
## ROBYN:
Yes...?
---
## SHARON:
I just have been thinking
that
the book-club ladies have been really really
receptive
to medicinal herbs
---
## ROBYN:
Sure seems like it.
---
## SHARON:
I was talking to Betty --

---
## ROBYN:
The one with the hair-net?
---
## SHARON:
Yes, and she mentioned that her goddaughter
had one of our brownies
---
## ROBYN:
Oh wait a minute
---
## SHARON:
Sort of by accident but
she really enjoyed it
---
## ROBYN:
How old is she?
---
## SHARON:
Twelve?
---
## ROBYN:
OH my god
---
## SHARON:
(It's fine!) and it occurred to me
you know
those ldds have a whole demographic available to them
that we don't
and I thought
what if we gave Betty's goddaughter some
supplies
to off-load
---
## ROBYN:
Hold up.
Hold up.
You want Betty's twelve-year-old goddaughter
to seil pot brownies for us
to her friends.
---
## SHARON:
Or regular pot.
---
## ROBYN:
Sharon!
---
## SHARON:
To her classmates.
---
## ROBYN:
Her classmates?
---
## SHARON:
(Helpfully.) She might not have many actual
friends
she's a little strange-looldng
(her teeth, and...)
but uh, classmates and
you know, ldds she knows from places.
---
## ROBYN:
Okay
Sharon?
Okay
listen
---
## SHARON:
And I know you might have concems
---
## ROBYN:
"Concerns"
yes, yes I do
concerns
---
## SHARON:
But I just think,
let's think about this.
Expansion is progress.
So. Let's consider.
(A beat.)
---
## ROBYN:
"Expansion is progress"
VVhere did you even...?
---
## SHARON:
I read that.
---
## ROBYN:
You read it.
---
## SHARON:
I was reading this article in Harvard Business
Review
yesterday
about women entrepreneurs
and they all said Expansion is progress.
Because women settle for things,
we nurture, nurturing requires settlement
to some degree
but
we deserve progress too.
Don't you think?
(A beat.)
---
## ROBYN:
Since when do you read Harvard Business Review?
---
## SHARON:
I want to know what's going on.
---
## ROBYN:
...By reading Harvard Business Review?
---
## SHARON:
What!
(Pause - refocusing.9
---
## ROBYN:
---
## SHARON:
.. I don't think off-loading pot brownies to Betty's adoleseent buek-toothed goddaughter is going to provide progress, entrepreneurial or otherwise. And you Imow, low profile, Sharon
we are keeping a low profile
we are not expanding a business.
Sustaining and expanding are two different activities
and it's great that now you read Harvard Business Review
but expanding is no longer an interest of mine. (Beat.)
---
## SHARON:
And then there's this other thing.
---
## ROBYN:
What other thing...
---
## SHARON:
Well.
I got us something.
---
## ROBYN:
What?
---
## SHARON:
And it's sort ofjust in ease.
We don't need it now
so I don't think we should think that we need it now
but I just thought, it's good to be prepared. ---
## ROBYN:
What did you buy.
(SHARON goes to a large shopping bag.)
(She takes out a large gun.)
---
## SHARON:

---
## SHARON:
I went to the Walmart in Cedar Rapids
---
## ROBYN:
WHAT THE PUCK!
---
## SHARON:
And there was a nice young man who [sold me this]
---
## ROBYN:
Do you even know how to use a gun??
---
## SHARON:
I've been watehing videos on YouTube it doesn't look hard.
---
## ROBYN:
Sharon!
We cannot own a gun.
---
## SHARON:
This is Iowa, everybody owns a gun.
---
## ROBYN:
Okay
a hunting rifle
if you hunted
okay
but this
sort of phallic
semi-automatic...
what is this?
---
## SHARON:
Do you wanna hold it?
It's got a weight to it
it feels warm
like you're holding a sort of pet or
somebody's limb
or your own extra limb
---
## ROBYN:
Sharon!
---
## SHARON:
What?
---
## ROBYN:
Take it back.
---
## SHARON:
What??
---
## ROBYN:
Do you have the receipt?
Take it back.
---
## SHARON:
(Canny.) Hold it and I'lllook for the receipt.
(A beat.)
(---
## ROBYN:
holds the gun.)
(SHARON knows exactly where her receipt is and takes her sweet time looking for it.)
What's it feel like?
---
## ROBYN:
Heavy.
---
## SHARON:
Powerful?
---
## ROBYN:
Dangerous.
---
## SHARON:
But doesn't it feel good?
(Pause.)
---
## SHARON:
I walked out of that Walmart
and I lmew that everybody who looked at me
was looking through me
but I knew what they weren't seeing.
I lmew what I had.
(Beat.)
---
## ROBYN:
Find your receipt?
---
## SHARON:
Still looldng.
---
## ROBYN:
We're not gonna shoot anybody.
Who did you wanna shoot?
---
## SHARON:
I don't want to shoot anybody
I just want to be prepared.
---
## ROBYN:
Prepared to shoot?
---
## SHARON:
Just prepared.
---
## ROBYN:
Take it back. Okay? Sharon?
---
## SHARON:
Okay.
---
## ROBYN:
Promise?
---
## SHARON:
I said okay.
I will.
---
## ROBYN:
I will.
---
## ROBYN:
Okay and just
in general, Sharon,
this is not...
expansion...is not...
Okay?
---
## SHARON:
Okay.
---
## ROBYN:
This is just
as this is.
No bigger.
---
## SHARON:
No smaller?
---
## ROBYN:
Just os we are.
---
## SHARON:
I like how we are.
(Beat.)
Found it. ---
## ROBYN:
Yeah? ---
## SHARON:
Right here. ---
## ROBYN:
Okay. ---
## SHARON:
Are we good? ---
## ROBYN:
We're good.
9.
(Evening, one week later.)
(The kitchen.)
(Music on the record player.)
(---
## ROBYN:
stands with the box of dolls. She has a large garbage bag. She seems to be about to throw them out, and then...)
(The sound of SHARON approaching.) (---
## ROBYN:
quickly hides the box.)
(SHARON comes into the kitchen from the out-side.)
(She is Dressed. Up.)
(And a teeny little bit drunk.)
(And it's pretty hot.)
---
## ROBYN:
Oh hey look who's home!
---
## SHARON:
There you are!
---
## ROBYN:
(Taking in the ouffit.) Whoa. Whoa mama. Look at you.
---
## SHARON:
Right? Whaddayou think?
---
## ROBYN:
Bold. Bold ehoice.
---
## SHARON:
Right?!
(Beat.)
Bold good or hold bad?
(She grabs ajoint off the table, lights it.)
---
## ROBYN:
Bold is...bold. lt e3dsts above the dietates of good and evil.
(Beat.)
That's for your book elub, you know we don't smoke that.
---
## SHARON:
It's just a little bit.
Do you want me to put this out?
---
## ROBYN:
No, just - next time -
(Beat.)
so.
---
## SHARON:
(Can't wait to be asked.) Yeeeees?
---
## ROBYN:
How was your date?
---
## SHARON:
WELL.
(This is a good thing!)
He's an ophthalmologist!
---
## ROBYN:
Okay...
---
## SHARON:
Eyes, that's eyes.
He knows about eyes.
---
## ROBYN:
Yeah okay, eyes.
---
## SHARON:
(This is not a good thing...) He's going bald...
---
## ROBYN:
Bald, okay.
---
## SHARON:
(Not sure how shefeels about this.) He was a child star?
---
## ROBYN:
What kind?
---
## SHARON:
Gerber food commercial.
---
## ROBYN:
Hmm.
---
## SHARON:
His experiences with fame haunted him. To this day.
---
## ROBYN:
Farne! Okay!
Overall verdict?
(Beat.)
---
## SHARON:
And he ldssed me.
---
## ROBYN:
You mean like an end-of-night ldss
or like a Kiss?
---
## SHARON:
Well we ldssed on the cheek when I first arrived
at the restaurant
but those don't count
(I mean in Paris everybody ldsses each other on the cheek all the time.)
but after dinner
we mode out.
In the car.
And he was very passionate
he kept bumping me into things
like the gear shift because he drives stick.
---
## ROBYN:
Well done!
---
## SHARON:
I don't think I ever really did that os a teenager.
Like, forty years lote, I mode out in a car.
(Beat.)
And he put his
hand
on my
(Breasts.)
you know
---
## ROBYN:
Oh-kay, I don't think we need to
---
## SHARON:
And he squeezed
---
## ROBYN:
Oh-kay
---
## SHARON:
And I just thought
is this what all the fuss is about?
---
## ROBYN:
...What?
---
## SHARON:
I just. I don't Imow. I was bored.
---
## ROBYN:
You were maldng out in a car!
You were banging into the gear shift!
He was squeezing various parts of you!
How were you bored?
---
## SHARON:
lt just felt like
I don't know
he was so.. .normal.
He told me I was pretty.
lt was very unambiguous.
He had ldds, he showed me pictures of them.
They looked like kids.
---
## ROBYN:
Sharon! You went on a nice date
with a man who was NOT a serial killer --

---
## SHARON:
I sort ofjust started entertaining myself aller a time.
---
## ROBYN:
What does that mean?
(SHARON takes a series of objects out of her pocket: cigarettes, a fancy lighter.)
---
## SHARON:
I took these out of his pocket while we were Idssing.
---
## ROBYN:
You -!
---
## SHARON:
(With pride.) He didn't even notice.
---
## ROBYN:
You robbed him
while he was kissing you.
---
## SHARON:
He won't miss them
It's just cigarettes
---
## ROBYN:
And a nice lighter!
---
## SHARON:
A lighter is a lighter.
---
## ROBYN:
That's not the point and you Imow it.
---
## SHARON:
When I was a girl I stole a penny candy from the
store
and my mother slapped me across the face.
She said, "Little girls don't take what isn't theirs."
And you know what?
She was right.
lt takes a grown lady to do that.
(Despite herself ---
## ROBYN:
is laughing.) ---
## ROBYN:
Sharon!!
---
## SHARON:
(Takes out a watch, sets it on the table.) Right off
his wrist, and he didn't notice.
Turns out, I'm good. Who Imew!
---
## ROBYN:
Sharon!
---
## SHARON:
What!
---
## ROBYN:
Sharon you cannot just
go on dates with people and
mug them
---
## SHARON:
He wasn't complaining.
---
## ROBYN:
I am complaining! (I think I'm complaining.)
The point is -
---
## SHARON:
The point is, if you'd been on a date with me
I wouldn't have mugged you.
(Beat. The air ehanges just a &de.)
---
## ROBYN:
What does that mean.
---
## SHARON:
I just mean
you're more exciting
than the rest of them.
I wouldn't have had to.
(Beat.)
Are you mad at me?
(Beat.)
He's just a guy
you don't even know him.
(Beat. ---
## ROBYN:
is sober now.)
---
## ROBYN:
Careful. With that.
---
## SHARON:
What!
---
## ROBYN:
"Just a guy.”
---
## SHARON:
I mean I didn't kill him.
I didn't like, poison him.
You Imow?
Everything's fine.
---
## ROBYN:
And the next time you go on a date?
And you get bored?
And it's just a guy?
---
## SHARON:
Don't you think you're overreacting?
(Beat.)
---
## ROBYN:
I meant to give this up.
I really did.
Until you, I did.
---
## SHARON:
Oh...
---
## ROBYN:
Until you
and how it was so
fall
and how you
surprised me
(you always surprise me.)
until that
I really
really
did.
---
## SHARON:
...Thank you.
---
## ROBYN:
It's hard to go back to the normal world.
To getting what you want so slowly, over so much time,
or sometimes to never getting it at all.
You start to need this.
---
## SHARON:
I'm doing this for fun.
---
## ROBYN:
Or you want it so bad it feels like you need it.
---
## SHARON:
I don't need it, ---
## ROBYN:

---
## ROBYN:
Are you sure?
(Beat. SHARON is not sure.)
---
## SHARON:
(Quiet.) I'm not a Idd who doesn't know right
from wrong.
You aren't raising me. Somebody already raised me,
and they did a shittyjob
and then I raised somebody and I did a shittyjob
and you, generally, all you've done is be a really
really
great
roommate.
(Beat.)
(---
## ROBYN:
almost laughs, but also she's too sad to laugh. She takes SHARON's joint. She
smokes, and SHARON tries to make out her expression.)
---
## SHARON:
---
## ROBYN:

---
## ROBYN:
What.
---
## SHARON:
Don't be sad.
Are you sad?
Don't be sad.
---
## ROBYN:
(Means it.) I'm glad you had a good date.
---
## SHARON:
Dick that.
I don't care about that.
---
## ROBYN:
---
## SHARON:
..
---
## SHARON:
I've had a good month. With you.
I've had good coffee
good conversations
and now we're making good money and that's good
but actually, it's not the money, it's the making.
Making something with you.
---
## ROBYN:
---
## SHARON:
..
---
## SHARON:
I look forward to waking up in the morning.
Everything is a Yes.
I'm smarter and faster and
younger
than I Imew I could be.
Don't be sad. I can't remember ever having been this
happy.
(A beat, and then SHARON gets up, decisively.)
We are gonna dance.
---
## ROBYN:
Oh come on.
---
## SHARON:
No
No
We are gonna dance.
You can't go to bed sad.
(She puts on a record. lt might be Sydney Bechet's "Si Tu Vois Ma Mire.")
---
## ROBYN:
What is that.
---
## SHARON:
It's World War Two London.
The whole world has been bombed.
---
## ROBYN:
London?
---
## SHARON:
We're the only two people left, in the mins of a
building
that hos also been bombed but still, oddly, is standing.
You're a pickpocket. And I'm a soldier.
Or maybe I'm a pickpocket and you're a sonor.
I don't know.
---
## ROBYN:
(But laughing.) You're crazy.
---
## SHARON:
We're sheltering. From the cold cold English wind. And then suddenly
from somewhere far away
a lone apartment somewhere high off the street
we hear music.
It dlifts.
lt comes to us.
lt catches us.
---
## ROBYN:
And then what?
(SHARON takes ---
## ROBYN:
s hand. They dance.)
(Old School World War H Bombed-Out London Dance. It's playful and funny at first, and then it's quiete7; and then it's tender and sweet and kind of shy, and then it heats up. And then SHARON kisses ---
## ROBYN:
)
(A beat. ---
## ROBYN:
pulls away. Wide-eyed.)
(A moment between them.)
---
## SHARON:
I'm sorry.
(Silence.)
I'm so sorry.
(Silence.)
Should I be sorry?
---
## ROBYN:
I have to go to bed. ---
## SHARON:
Are you mad at me? ---
## ROBYN:
I have to go to bed.
(Beat.)
I'm not mad at you. ---
## SHARON:
---
## ROBYN:
.. ---
## ROBYN:
Good night.
I0.
(Lute morning. Sunlight slants in.)
(The kitchen, as they left it: a mess.)
(SHARON comes downstairs in her bathrobe, groggy, a little hungover.)
(She puts the coffee on.)
(Starts to clean up a little.)
(She's waiting for ---
## ROBYN:
)
(She goes to the stairs a few times, listens to see if ---
## ROBYN:
is awake yet.)
(She starts making a little extra noise to see if ---
## ROBYN:
will wake up.)
(Dropping things "accidentally.'9
(And then she sees a note.)
(She picks it up.)
(Reads it.)
(Can't quite wrap her mind around it.)
(She opens the cabinets. ---
## ROBYN:
s things are gone. Out to the porch. ---
## ROBYN:
s boxes are gone. She rushes to look out onto the drive-way. ---
## ROBYN:
s car is gone. She comes back inside.)
(A beat.)
(She sits down heavily at the kitchen table.)
(A beat.)
(She picks the note back up.)
(Reads it.)
(Crumples it.)
(She makes a phone call. _lt goes to voicemail.)
---
## SHARON:
---
## ROBYN:
hi.
This is ---
## SHARON:

Obviously.
I just woke up and I saw your things are all gone and
did we get robbed in the night? I just got worried
so
call me.
(Beat.)
Actually I got your note, so
(Beat.)
call me anyway.
(Beat.)
You didn't have to... [leave]
(Beat.)
I mean if it was - you know -
I was drunk and I barely remember what I was even
[doing]
and it's not like I'm even [gay]
but even if I was [gay]
it's not like I want to date you
so
you don't have to worry about that!
There's lots of other women I'd date
if I was going to date a woman
so...
(Beat, disentangling herse(f)
Call me.
Okay?
(She hangs up.)
(Beat.)
(She calls ---
## ROBYN:
again. Voicemail.)
Hi ---
## ROBYN:
it's me again
clearly
you probably aren't checldng your phone
and you're probably going to check it sometime soon
sometime later
but soon
and then you'll see I've been trying to reach you
and I'm sorry if I'm being alarmist
but
it's pretty
empty.
The house.
Is empty.
And I just.
I think you should call me?
So.
(This is raw.)
I miss you.
(Attempting to recover.)
Okay.
Bye.
(She hangs up.)
(She calls ---
## ROBYN:
again. Voicemail.)
If you're going to leave because I ldssed you?
That's bullshit.
And if you're leaving for some other reason?
That's also bullshit.
I am a grown-ass adult.
Okay.
If you just don't want to be responsible for me,
then don't worry!
You're not responsible!
I absolve you!
And if you don't want to do the things we were doing
the phone calls and the book-club weed-ring and
whatever
that's fine!
Don't do it!
I won't do it!
I don't care, I'm done anyway.
Or if I did it, I'd do it without you!
And where are you going to go, anyway?
Nobody wants you.
Amanda doesn't want you!
So come back!
(She hangs up.)
(Shefinds a small box under things.)
(---
## ROBYN:
s ceramic dolls.)
(She takes one out.)
(Emotion surges in her.)
(She smashes the doll.)
(That felt good. Another one. Another one.)
(Then freezes.)
(Inside the third doll is a smallplastic bag.)
(The ceramic doll was stuffed with coke.)
(Another one of ---
## ROBYN:
s businesses.)
(She smashes more dolls. More bags of coke.)
(Coke and doll shards everywhere,)
(Sharon is frozen in this moment of discov-ery.)
I I
(The kitchen.)
(Morning.)
(A week later.)
(SHARON sleeps in her kitchen. Filth has accumulated. Dishes are unwashed, maybe take-out cartons litter the floor, clothes strewn. The WWH London record has been playing on loop, but now the record spins and the needle scratches.)
(The phone rings. SHARON jolts awake. She looks terrible. Not entirely sober. lt goes to the answering machine. Sharon's recorded voice on the machine is perky and bright.)
ANSWERING MACHINE. (Recording.) Hiii, you've reached Sharon, I'm so sorry I can't come to the phone right now but leave me a message at the beep! Have a great day!
SHARON'S SON. (Recording.) Mom. Hey. It's me. You home?
(SHARON makes no move to answer it.)
Haven't heard from you in a while.
I mean that's cool, you must be
Doing Things so
that's awesome!
But
Your roommate called me.
(Will she pick up? But...no. He can't help her right now.)
She said she had to leave for business
and she wanted me to check in on you
and I realized, we hadn't talked in a bit
like a little bit
and uh
you left me some messages?
That, franldy, were kind of
crazy messages?
so I thought...
I'd call you
but
I guess I'll try you later.
Bye Mom.
(He hangs up.)
(A beat.)
(And then, the phone rings.)
(This time, she answers it.)
---
## SHARON:
...Heike...?
(And we see ---
## ROBYN:
Perhaps by the side of a highway. Perhaps somewhere shadowy and too far to reach. Either way, her voicefills the entire space, soft and close.)
---
## ROBYN:
Hell°. This is Victoria Jones from the Franco--Global Society of International Orphans. Is this Sharon?
(A beat.)
---
## SHARON:
This is ---
## SHARON:

---
## ROBYN:
Hi ---
## SHARON:

I'm calling you because we want to thank you.
For your hard work.
Your...donations. Your...support.
---
## SHARON:
My...?
---
## ROBYN:
We recognize that it is hard to...care for strangers. People who maybe
their lives have taken place on the other side of the world from you
and their lives will continue to take place on the other side of the world
and someone with a less...developed...heart might think: what does that have to do with me? But you cared. You are a caring person.
And the Franco-Global Society of International Orphans just wants to thank you for that.
(A beat.)
---
## SHARON:
Are you coming back?
---
## ROBYN:
Orphans, once they have left their homes for new
placements
rarely return.
---
## SHARON:
Victoria Jones.
---
## ROBYN:
Yes?
---
## SHARON:
Why is that.
---
## ROBYN:
Because sometimes their pasts are
contentious
and they recognize that they could cause great harm
to those they have come to care for
by returning.
---
## SHARON:
Or maybe sometimes they forget and move on and don't care anymore.
---
## ROBYN:
No. That's not it.
I've done this job for a hundred years.
And that's not it.
---
## SHARON:
Are you with Amanda?
(A beat.)
---
## ROBYN:
I have to go now, Sharon, but
on behalf of all of us here at FGSTO
please take care of yoursel£
---
## SHARON:
Wait!
---
## ROBYN:
What is it?
---
## SHARON:
Will I ever hear from you again?
(A beat.)
---
## ROBYN:
We might occasionally make a courtesy call,
to check in on some of our most helpful donors. (A beat.)
---
## SHARON:
Bye Victoria Jones.
IMSYN. Goodbye.
(She hangs up. A beat.)
(SHARON looks around her kitchen.
(She starts to wake up in a new way.)
(This is a prayer. Or a poem. lt is raw and fragile and nem)
---
## SHARON:
I'm standing in my kitchen.
I am standing in my kitchen and
my roommate told me that
people find words for themselves but
those words are not always right and
I think I don't have the right words, anymore.
Sharon doesn't feel [right].
Wife is no longer [right]
and for some time now, Mother hos not been
right.
(Pause.)
"Roommate" was good.
That was a good word.
But now it's no longer
right.
(Beat - a burst of anger.)
I just think
that there is a heiter way to do things than the one where we live a certain life and then we lose it completely!
(Pause.)
I slept in the Idtchen for a week.
And now I'm awake.
And this house is very empty.
And I don't know where to start.
Except over. Again.
(She gathers up the doll shards and coke bag-gies. We might think she's going to throw them out.
(And then...)
(She sets the bags of coke on the table in a long row.)
All first poems are bad poems...
but there's a great liberty in being bad.
(As she considers her bot, and a glorious future of illegal activity...)
(Blackout.)
