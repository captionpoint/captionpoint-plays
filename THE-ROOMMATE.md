1.
(The kitchen.)
(SHARONfinishes helping ROBYN carry boxes
in. So many boxes! One contains weird veg-
etables from a GSA. Some vegetables are just
odd, but others look actively dangerous.)
---
## SHARON:
(A little out of breath.) And this is the kitchen
I'm a big cook, I love to cook
You said you cooked?
---
## ROBYN:
I cook, sure.
---
## SHARON:
Okay! Okay
Well
we can divide up the refrigerator or the pantry shelves
depending on
sort of what and when you cook
---
## ROBYN:
I'm a vegan
---
## SHARON:
(Doesn't really know what that is.) Okay! Okay...
---
## ROBYN:
No animal products.
---
## SHARON:
Okay!
So like...no meat...
---
## ROBYN:
Nope, no meat
---
## SHARON:
Or eggs
---
## ROBYN:
That would be an animal product
---
## SHARON:
Sure! Sure it would
Uh...but like, carrots
---
## ROBYN:
Ye s carrots are fine
---
## SHARON:
I mean, clearly carrots are [fine]
...but for example, using pans or pots or
knives or
9
you know, that I've used for meat...
I mean, is that going to be...?
---
## ROBYN:
I have my own cooking utensils
in one of the boxes there's
---
## SHARON:
Oh! sure sure
yeah we can find
there's some extra cabinet space if we just
move things around a bit
---
## ROBYN:
Yeah there's a lot of space
this seems very spacious
---
## SHARON:
I mean there's space
it's not palatial but
I mean, Iowa, it specializes in
corn and space
(She laughs, ROBYN doesn't. Awkward.)
If you want you can leave stuff on the porch
'til you're all unpacked
---
## ROBYN:
Oh no no, I don't want to take up your
---
## SHARON:
No no! That's fine
I don't use the side porch that much anyway
it's nice in the summer I guess but
(Picking up a weird vegetable:)
What's this?
---
## ROBYN:
That's goya.
---
## SHARON:
What-now?
---
## ROBYN:
Goya. It's a vegetable.
A bitter gourd.
---
## SHARON:
Okay! Yes. Yes. Wow. Well. I see I am going to
learn a lot from having you as a roommate.
(She laughs. ROBYN doesn't really.)
(Beat.)
You must be tired. Driving all the way from... New
Yo r k , you said?
c- 11

o 
---
## ROBYN:
The Bronx.
---
## SHARON:
The -! The Bronx!

---
## ROBYN:
Took about two days, by car.
---
## SHARON:
I thought...
---
## ROBYN:
What?
---
## SHARON:
I don't know,
When you said New York, I thought
somewhere Upstate
I didn't think...
Isn't the Bronx...
dangerous?
o
---
## ROBYN:
"Dangerous."
o 
---
## SHARON:
And you're - I mean. You're a woman.
I mean. I don't know.
o I've never lived in New York.
---
## ROBYN:
It's okay. I mean. There's parts. Parts where you
don't wanna
late at night, you don't wanna
but it's fine. I stayed there for a little while and nothing
ever
---
## SHARON:
(With relief) Oh you aren'tfrom the Bronx!
(A slight pause.)

---
## ROBYN:
Everywhere has parts like that.
---
## SHARON:
Oh it's mostly pretty safe here.
o Except for the tornados.
o ---
## ROBYN:
(Alarmed.) Tornados?
---
## SHARON:
Oh yeah, in the spring mostly
early summer
you just go on down to the basement 'til they pass. It's
fine.
---
## ROBYN:
(Even more alarmed.) There are a lot of tornados
here?
---
## SHARON:
Not as bad as some places.
---
## ROBYN:
Like how many tornados would you say, on average?
12 
---
## SHARON:
It's fine! If you hear that big old siren
you just go down to the basement.
Really
it's no scarier than the Bronx.
---
## ROBYN:
(Has to smile.) I guess not if you're from here.
---
## SHARON:
(Immediately.) I'm notfrom here. You know. I'm
not Iowan.
---
## ROBYN:
Oh okay
---
## SHARON:
I don't know if I said that?
When we talked on the phone, if I said that?
---
## ROBYN:
I don't think so, but it doesn't really
---
## SHARON:
I'm from Illinois, originally.
---
## ROBYN:
Oh!
---
## SHARON:
It's actually quite different from Iowa.
---
## ROBYN:
I'll take your word for it.
(Beat.)
---
## SHARON:
My son lives in New York.
---
## ROBYN:
Oh!
You have a son?
---
## SHARON:
I do, he lives in New York.
---
## ROBYN:
That's great. In the Bronx?
---
## SHARON:
No! No no
He lives
"Park Slope" do you know where [that is?]
He lives in "Park Slope."CC
---
## ROBYN:
Oh yeah, that's great.
---
## SHARON:
He pays way too much for [rent]
I tell him that all the time, I say
In Iowa you could have a house for the money you
spend on [rent]
(Laughs a little, stops.)
He doesn't like it when I say that.
He didn't like Iowa.
---
## ROBYN:
The tornados?
---
## SHARON:
No he just didn't like it.
(Beat. Have they run out of conversation?
SHARON hastens.)
He's a designer.
---
## ROBYN:
Oh! That's great!
---
## SHARON:
He's very good, everybody thinks he's very good.
---
## ROBYN:
What does he design?
---
## SHARON:
(Doesn't really know.) Clothes, he mostly designs
clothes. For women?
---
## ROBYN:
Oh!
---
## SHARON:
Everybody thinks he's a homosexual, but he's not.
(Where did this come from? SHARON has
surprised herself A beat.)
---
## ROBYN:
I'm gay.
---
## SHARON:
Oh!
You ' r e -?
Oh!!
You ' r e -??
(Beat.)
I mean, I don't have any problem with homosexuals.
---
## ROBYN:
Oh good.
---
## SHARON:
Nope. Not at all. I think, you know, gay rights!
Let them marry!
---
## ROBYN:
Thank you.
---
## SHARON:
Some of my son's friends are homosexual people.
Probably most of them.
---
## ROBYN:
Oh.
---
## SHARON:
I think most New Yorkers are.
---
## ROBYN:
I think actually there are a lot of straight people in
New York.
---
## SHARON:
I kissed a girl once in college.
(Beat.)
I'm sorry. I'm nervous.

14 


---
## ROBYN:
Why are you nervous?
---
## SHARON:
I mean. A roommate! I've never had a roommate.
(This is an admission offailure.9
I'm fifty-four years old.
A roommate!
---
## ROBYN:
It's okay. You'll save money.

---
## SHARON:
No, I know! I know. I definitely
I will definitely save money.
(Beat.)
You - did you have a lot more boxes in the car?
---
## ROBYN:
I've got it.
---
## SHARON:
(Really doesn't want to keep carrying boxes.) Well
if you're sure.
---
## ROBYN:
Be right back.

(She exits back out to the car.)
(SHARON sits alone in her kitchen with all
these new, weird vegetables. She takes a deep
breath. Okay. It's okay.)
---
## SHARON:
(Calling after ROBYN.) To d a y is my reading group!
---
## ROBYN:
(Offstage.) What did you say?
---
## SHARON:
Oh, I said: today is my reading group.
If you want to come with me.

(ROBYN returns. She's carrying a heavy box.)
---
## ROBYN:
Your "reading group"?
---
## SHARON:
You know, a book club. Only Tanya calls it a
reading group -
(She jumps up to help ROBYN set the box on
the table. ROBYN pulls away.)
---
## ROBYN:
I've got it!
---
## SHARON:
- Tanya's the one who runs it, she says everything
just a little bit wrong, it's because she's from Idaho
and there wasn't any culture there, so she didn't get
exposed to things until much later in life.


(Beat.)
Is that more vegetables?
---
## ROBYN:
No that goes upstairs.
A reading group...
(Beat.)
Isn't that. Kind of. For old people?
---
## SHARON:
(Amazed.) We are old people.
---
## ROBYN:
(Amazed.) We are?
(A beat. They study each other. Each is kind
of baffled by the other. Then ROBYN turns
away.)
I'll just take this upstairs. But thanks for the invitation.
---
## SHARON:
You're so welcome. You let me know if there's
anything you need.
Mi casa es su casa!
(Beat)
Literally.
---
## ROBYN:
Okay then.
(She picks up the box and almost drops it.)
(A ceramic doll falls out and smashes.)
(The box is full of ceramic dolls.)
---
## SHARON:
Oh no!
---
## ROBYN:
Stay there!
(ROBYN moves quickly between SHARON and
the shards.)
---
## SHARON:
Are you okay? Do you need help?
---
## ROBYN:
(Sharp.) I've got this!
Is there a [broom]?
---
## SHARON:
Here...
(Gets her a broom.)
Do you want me to...?
---
## ROBYN:
No no
16 
---
## ROBYN:
I've got it.
(As she sweeps - calmer.)
Sorry I didn't mean to [snap]
I just didn't want you to get cut.
---
## SHARON:
(Peering into the box.) What...are all these dolls?
---
## ROBYN:
Please!!
(SHARON moves away from the box.)
Sorry. They're - it's personal.
---
## SHARON:
I didn't mean to pry.
---
## ROBYN:
I made them. I used to be a potter.
---
## SHARON:
You were?
---
## ROBYN:
They're patterned after these antique South
American dolls.
---
## SHARON:
Oh! Wow
---
## ROBYN:
But then I stopped. So.
It's a little embarrassing.
---
## SHARON:
You shouldn't be embarrassed, they're very
(She doesn't like them.)
Evocative.
---
## ROBYN:
Evocative?
---
## SHARON:
They evoke things.
---
## ROBYN:
They're actually voodoo dolls.
---
## SHARON:
Voodoo??
---
## ROBYN:
Kidding.
---
## SHARON:
I mean I don't know
They look a little voodoo-y to me.
---
## ROBYN:
Maybe they evoke voodoo.
(A beat. They share a smile.)
---
## SHARON:
I didn't mean that in a bad way.
---
## ROBYN:
It's okay. I'm done with all that.
---
## SHARON:
Why did you stop?
---
## ROBYN:
I stopped because
n
 17
uh
it wasn't the sort of lifestyle
that...
Being a potter can be very
stressful.
(Beat.)
---
## SHARON:
Your boxes are so heavy and you just got here.
Leave them on the porch and put your feet up.
I'll get us coffee.
---
## ROBYN:
Is your porch safe?
---
## SHARON:
Safe?
---
## ROBYN:
Break-ins?
---
## SHARON:
This is Iowa.
---
## ROBYN:
Yes?
---
## SHARON:
No break-ins.
---
## ROBYN:
But you lock the doors?
---
## SHARON:
I can lock the doors.
If that makes you feel comfortable, I can start locking
the doors.
---
## ROBYN:
I feel better with things. Locked.
---
## SHARON:
A New York thing?
---
## ROBYN:
Sure.
---
## SHARON:
A Bronx thing?
---
## ROBYN:
A Robyn thing.
(Re: the doll box.)
I'll just take this up to my room...
---
## SHARON:
Oh! Just up the stairs
immediate left -
would you like me to show you?
---
## ROBYN:
I've got it.
Here we go, take two.
(She hoists the box with the dolls and exits
upstairs.)
18 
2.
(Morning. Kitchen.)
(SHARON on the phone with her son.)
---
## SHARON:
(Excited, sotto voce.) And here's the other thing!
She's a homosexual!
(Beat.)
Well I don't care OF COURSE, but you asked if
anything interesting happened, and I thought that
was interesting.
(Beat.)
Also she used to be a potter
she said she made voodoo dolls but
she was just joshing me.
(Beat.)
When are you going to come visit?
(Beat - he's too busy.)
No... I know...of course, yes...
No, forget it, maybe over the summer.
(Beat.)
Maybe I should come visit you.
(Beat - he's trying to get out of this.)
We always have such fun when I visit you! I love staying
with you, your roommate is so lovely, the tall one,
what's his name... Do you know what he did last
time, he did the funniest thing, did I tell you this?
He was
(Beat - her son is saying that she has told
him this so many times.)
Oh. Oh yes. I guess I did, didn't I.
(Beat.)
She's joined a...local farm. And she just got here! She
just picked up some boxes of vegetables on her way
here. I mean that's very healthy, she seems very
healthy. And she just bought a folding bicycle, like
a...like sort of a folding chair, but it's a bicycle.
(Her son isn't as impressed as she is.)
Anyway, she seems like a very healthy person with a
very sort of healthy lifestyle, and I just think this is
all going to just be very healthy for me.
(ROBYN wanders in. She's smoking.)
(SHARON coughs. She coughs pointedly.)
(ROBYN glances at her.)
---
## ROBYN:
Oh! Sorry!
(SHARON coughs and fans the air.)
Sorry!
(ROBYN goes out onto the porch and chain-
smokes.)
(Back to the phone:)
---
## SHARON:
(Intense whisper.) SHE. IS. SMOKING.
(Beat.)
Well I thought I was fairly clear about that when I said
I was looking for a woman in her fifties.
(Beat.)
Are you LAUGHING at me?
(Beat.)
I have to go.
(Beat - he's apologizing, but she won't be
mollified.)
No, no it's okay. I have to go. I know how busy you are.
(She hangs up.)
(A beat.)
(ROBYN comes back in.)
2
---
## ROBYN:
Morning.
---
## SHARON:
Good morning.
(Beat.)
---
## ROBYN:
Sorry about that.
---
## SHARON:
I didn't know you smoked.
---
## ROBYN:
I quit. I'm quitting. I quit.
---
## SHARON:
Oh.
---
## ROBYN:
I quit right before I moved. So.
---
## SHARON:
Oh.
---
## ROBYN:
New places stress me out.
---
## SHARON:
You weren't stressed out in the Bronx but you're
stressed out in Iowa?
---
## ROBYN:
I was stressed out in the Bronx, which is why I
smoked there.
And I am stressed out in Iowa, which is why I just
smoked here.
Even though I quit.
I am re-quitting.
---
## SHARON:
They have nicotine gum at the gas station.
They didn't used to, but now it's become popular.
---
## ROBYN:
The gum is no good, I get hooked on the gum.
I just need to quit cold turkey.
Everything that I do, I just need to DO it, no half-
measures. Just jump.
---
## SHARON:
(Impressed despite herself) Like moving to Iowa?
---
## ROBYN:
Like moving to Iowa.
(A warmer beat between the women: a shared
humor.)
---
## SHARON:
Do you want some eggs? I was gonna make eggs.
---
## ROBYN:
I can't, but thanks.
---
## SHARON:
You -?
Oh!
Vegan!
---
## ROBYN:
Vegan.
flOrOrnnnCCr-Mn
 21
---
## SHARON:
Vegan.
Coffee? Without milk?
---
## ROBYN:
I'd love some coffee. With almond milk.
---
## SHARON:
I don't have almond milk.
---
## ROBYN:
I got it from the co-op yesterday.
You can try it.
(She gets out the almond milk.)
(SHARON thinks it's very strange, but:)
---
## SHARON:
(Very determined.) Okay yes.
Ye s , I will.
(She lets ROBYN put almond milk in her
coffee. They drink coffee together.)
It's...
---
## ROBYN:
Weird?
---
## SHARON:
Weird.
---
## ROBYN:
Bad?
---
## SHARON:
Not bad.
(Beat.)
(The warmth between them becomes awk-
ward again.)
So what do you do?
---
## ROBYN:
Me?
---
## SHARON:
Uh. You.
---
## ROBYN:
Well. I do a lot of things.
(SHARON waits. ROBYN drinks more almond-
milk coffee.)
---
## SHARON:
Oh.
Well.
Like what do you do?
For example.
---
## ROBYN:
Well.
(Beat.)

22 


---
## ROBYN:
I'm a poet.
---
## SHARON:
A poet!
---
## ROBYN:
Yes, I write poetry.
(Beat.)
---
## SHARON:
That's great!
I love poetry!

(Beat - honest.)
I don't really understand poetry
---
## ROBYN:
I write slam poetry
---
## SHARON:
I don't know what that is.
---
## ROBYN:
I write poems and then I perform them.
---
## SHARON:
And what do you write...about?

(A pause.)
---
## ROBYN:
I do other things too.
---
## SHARON:
Oh?
---
## ROBYN:
I grow things. I like to grow things.
---
## SHARON:
I never had much of a green thumb but
that's wonderful!
What do you grow?

(A pause.)
---
## ROBYN:
What do you do?
---
## SHARON:
(Completely off-balanced.) Me?
I mean.
I live here. Obviously.
---
## ROBYN:
Yeah...
---
## SHARON:
I'm a mother...

---
## ROBYN:
Right.
---
## SHARON:
I'm retired!
---
## ROBYN:
From what?
(Beat.)
---
## SHARON:
My marriage.
---
## ROBYN:
Oh.




CT 23
---
## SHARON:
Ye a h . So.
---
## ROBYN:
I'm sorry?
---
## SHARON:
Don't be.
CI---
## ROBYN:
Then I'm not.
(Beat, ROBYN smiles, then SHARON does.)
Cr
(A shared moment.)
---
## SHARON:
I'd love to hear some of your poems.
---
## ROBYN:
Oh. I don't think so.
---
## SHARON:
Maybe you could explain them to me.
---
## ROBYN:
Poetry can't really...be explained.
---
## SHARON:
That's probably why I don't like it.
CIOh! Sorry! I didn't mean...
---
## ROBYN:
No. No no. It's okay.
I don't like poetry either.

---
## SHARON:
You don't?

---
## ROBYN:
I like mine. But I don't have a lot of patience for
other people's.
---
## SHARON:
I think I feel that way about children.
---
## ROBYN:
I think I feel that way about most things.
(Another shared smile. Beat.)
---
## SHARON:
So...why Iowa?
---
## ROBYN:
Why not Iowa?

---
## SHARON:
Do you know anybody here?
---
## ROBYN:
You.
---
## SHARON:
Me?
---
## ROBYN:
You now.
Now I know you.
C.(This pleases SHARON.)
---
## SHARON:
Well
what would you like to do

here?
There's the University, there's adult classes
(there's poetry!)
24 
or
hot yoga
on North Clinton
Which I've never taken but I see everybody through the
window
when I go by, and they all look so
Healthy and Happy, you sort of want to injure them
but yeah, so, there's yoga...
My son thinks Iowa City is boring but
if he just visited me more often he'd see that
now it's very cultural here, Iowa City is actually very
[cultural]
I mean I sort of haven't [been involved]
but you might want to [be involved]
---
## ROBYN:
I thought maybe I'd raise bees.
---
## SHARON:
Bees.
---
## ROBYN:
And maybe a sheep or
a cow or
something.
---
## SHARON:
A.. .sheep.
---
## ROBYN:
I don't know, I imagined
wide open skies, I think and
rising at dawn...
A sort of... restorative manual labor...
---
## SHARON:
O11...hmm...
We could have a garden...?
---
## ROBYN:
My grandmother was from Iowa.
---
## SHARON:
She was?
(ROBYN has surprised them both with this
revelation. A moment.)
---
## ROBYN:
I didn't know her.
But.
I heard she was from Iowa.
---
## SHARON:
(Beat - a little wistfully.) I guess everybody wants
to start over. Just burn it all down and start over.
nn1=flnnnn
 25
---
## ROBYN:
(A genuine question.) Do you?
---
## SHARON:
I don't know...
---
## ROBYN:
You said "everybody." So...don't you?
---
## SHARON:
I guess I do. Sometimes.
---
## ROBYN:
Maybe you already did. When you...retired...from
your marriage.
---
## SHARON:
No, that didn't feel like a...glorious blaze. It just
feels -
flit
very sad. And cold.
And then there was nobody to talk to in the mornings.
(Beat.)
He retired before I did.
Actually.
From the marriage.
But he didn't tell me that, so I had to find it out myself.
---
## ROBYN:
Another woman?
---
## SHARON:
No
He just started spending all his money on models of
things
airplanes, trains, cars
and he'd spend all his time with those mini-things
instead of with me, in our normal-sized life.
(Beat.)
Ha!
Maybe I'll write a..."slam" poem about that
and you can perform it.
(Beat.)
---
## ROBYN:
I've retired from slam poetry.
But you should do it anyway.
---
## SHARON:
I've never written a slam poem before.
(Beat.)
If you're no longer a poet
26 
or a potter
what are you?
(A beat.)
(ROBYN gets up.)
---
## ROBYN:
It'll probably be bad, all first poems are bad poems.
There's a great liberty in being bad.
(She leaves the kitchen.)
(SHARON stares after her, struck to the heart
by this wisdom.)

OUUOUDOCUOUUOUCJUOUULJO

3.
(Night. A week later.)
(ROBYN at the kitchen table, alone.)
(Her pot plants are set on the window-sill.)
(Very carefully, with immense precision,
she rolls a joint. SHARON comes in, phone in
hand.)
---
## ROBYN:
Hey!
---
## SHARON:
(Startled.) Oh!
(Sees.)
I thought you quit.
---
## ROBYN:
It's not tobacco.
---
## SHARON:
(Not kidding.) Then what is it?
(A beat.)
(ROBYN looks at her like: Seriously?)
(A beat.)
(SHARON gets it.)
OH.
You —?
Are those —?
Are those drugs?
---
## ROBYN:
Sharon.
---
## SHARON:
What!
---
## ROBYN:
It's medicinal.
Medicinal herbs.
---
## SHARON:
I thought it was drugs?
---
## ROBYN:
Herbs only become drugs when a capitalist
economy gets involved.
---
## SHARON:
Oh.
(A beat. She sits at the kitchen table.)
(She can't help her curiosity.)

28 


---
## SHARON:
Is there some - place - here? Where you go? And
buy...herbs?
---
## ROBYN:
You mean like a long sticky alley, and a guy with a
ski mask is waiting at the end of it?
---
## SHARON:
Is that...?
Is that -!
---
## ROBYN:
No!
I grew these.
(Gestures to the plants.)

I grow my own medicinal herbs, Sharon.
---
## SHARON:
Those are...?
---
## ROBYN:
I thought you knew. You said you liked them!
---
## SHARON:
I did like them! I thought they were just.. .weird...
plants.
---
## ROBYN:
Oh man, Okay. Well.
(Finishes rolling the joint.)
Outside. Right?

---
## SHARON:
Right.
---
## ROBYN:
Right.
(She gets up.)
(But SHARON isn't ready to be left alone.)
---
## SHARON:
I can't get ahold of my son.

---
## ROBYN:
You called him?
---
## SHARON:
I've called. I've been calling.
---
## ROBYN:
It's a Friday night.
---
## SHARON:
I know.
---
## ROBYN:
So he's probably out.
---
## SHARON:
I texted him too.
---
## ROBYN:
Is something the matter?
---
## SHARON:
What do you mean?
---
## ROBYN:
Well if it's a Friday night and you're texting him
and you're calling him, is something the matter?

(A beat.)

nnnn

---
## SHARON:
I just think it's a good thing for us to stay in touch.
For a mother and a son to stay in touch.
Don't you?
---
## ROBYN:
Ye a h . Yes. I do.
But it might be better to stay in touch on a Thursday.
Or in the morning.
You know?
(A beat.)
---
## SHARON:
(Completely unconvinced and kind of upset.) No,
sure, of course.
(A beat.)
(ROBYN sits back down.)
---
## ROBYN:
Is he dating someone?
---
## SHARON:
Yeah.
I think so?
He doesn't really
communicate
about that kind of thing.
---
## ROBYN:
Maybe he's out with his boyfriend.
---
## SHARON:
Girlfriend.
---
## ROBYN:
Right, sorry Straight. You said that.
---
## SHARON:
Just because he's a designer doesn't mean
---
## ROBYN:
You ' r e right, I forgot.
Maybe he's out with his girlfriend, at a nice dinner.
---
## SHARON:
I met her once.
---
## ROBYN:
That's nice.
---
## SHARON:
She's a lesbian.
---
## ROBYN:
...Oh?
---
## SHARON:
Not that there's anything wrong with that!!
---
## ROBYN:
How long have they been dating?
---
## SHARON:
A few years.
She's got that short hair.
You know.

We went to brunch and she mentioned an ex-girlfriend.
Apparently they're friends with her ex-girlfriend.
It's all very confusing.
(A beat.)
---
## ROBYN:
I was married to a man.
---
## SHARON:
You were??
---
## ROBYN:
Ye a h .
---
## SHARON:
I didn't know that.
---
## ROBYN:
I've only been here a week, why would you know
that?
---
## SHARON:
But then you realized you were gay? And you left
him?
---
## ROBYN:
No, we were in love. And it ended badly. But we
loved each other.
---
## SHARON:
(Amazed and a little scared.) Are you...a bisexual?
---
## ROBYN:
No. I'm just saying
people find specific words for themselves because it's
easier than not having words.
You know?
But
it doesn't mean those words are all accurate
all the time.
So if she's been with your son for years, she probably
loves him.
Which means, your son probably has lots of people
who love him.
Which is a good thing.
He's probably out right now with people who love him.
And if you call him in the morning, maybe he'll tell you
about it.
(A beat.)
(SHARON gets up. She goes to the cupboard,
gets out some Johnnie Walker.)
---
## ROBYN:
Ohhh-kay.

---
## SHARON:
You want some?
---
## ROBYN:
I'm okay.
---
## SHARON:
Just a little nightcap.
---
## ROBYN:
I'm sober. But you go ahead.
---
## SHARON:
(Factually, not mean.) You do drugs.
---
## ROBYN:
I medicate myself with medicinal herbs.
But my days with alcohol are over.
(SHARON sits down but doesn't pour herself a
drink. She studies the joint carefully. ROBYN
gets up.)
I'm gonna have a smoke on your porch and then call it
a-
---
## SHARON:
(Doesn't want to be left alone.) I've never.
Smoked that.
---
## ROBYN:
...No?
---
## SHARON:
No.
Not even in college.
I kissed a -
I told you that.
But drugs? I never.
---
## ROBYN:
Please stop calling it that.
---
## SHARON:
Sorry.
(Beat.)
---
## ROBYN:
Would you like some?
---
## SHARON:
Yes.
Ye s please.
---
## ROBYN:
Okay.
(She hesitates, then sits back down. Lights
it up. Takes a long drag, then hands it to
SHARON.)
---
## SHARON:
How do you...?
---
## ROBYN:
You just...like a cigarette.
Have you ever...?
32 


---
## SHARON:
Once.
---
## ROBYN:
Once. Okay. Like that.
Just drag it in deep, and then hold your breath.
---
## SHARON:
This isn't gonna give me cancer, right?
---
## ROBYN:
Nope. No cancer.
---
## SHARON:
Okay.
(She takes a deep drag.)

(Lets it out, coughing a little, but...)
---
## ROBYN:
Yeah! Nice.
---
## SHARON:
I don't feel anything.
---
## ROBYN:
Give it a second.
---
## SHARON:
What am I going to feel?
---
## ROBYN:
Relaxed.
---
## SHARON:
Am I gonna hallucinate?
---
## ROBYN:
No! No. You'll just feel relaxed.
---
## SHARON:
(Getting more tense.) I never feel relaxed. I'm not
a relaxed person. What if I don't feel relaxed?
---
## ROBYN:
You will one hundred percent feel relaxed.
(SHARON takes another drag, just in case.)
(Then gives the joint back to ROBYN.)
---
## SHARON:
I think my son doesn't like me.

---
## ROBYN:
I'm sure that's not
---
## SHARON:
He loves me. I know he loves me.
But I think he doesn't like me very much.
---
## ROBYN:
Our kids don't have to like us, they just have to
survive long enough to become us.
---
## SHARON:
Do you have kids?!
(Beat.)
(ROBYN passes the joint back to SHARON.)

---
## ROBYN:
Your turn.
(Beat. SHARON takes another drag.)

---
## SHARON:
You didn't tell me you -
---
## ROBYN:
Sharon.
---
## SHARON:
Yeah?
(A half-beat. In lieu of saying "shut up":)
---
## ROBYN:
Tell me more about your son.
(Half-beat.)
---
## SHARON:
He's very smart.
He's very good-looking.
I know it's strange for a mother to say that about her
OW11 -
but it's true. He's a very attractive boy.
And I don't know where he gets that from because his
father
Good lord.
That man looked like a potato.
---
## ROBYN:
He probably got it from you.
---
## SHARON:
Me?
No!
Me?
(Beat.)
Do you think I'm good-looking?
---
## ROBYN:
I think you're pretty, yeah.
---
## SHARON:
Do you mean that in a factual way, or a lesbian
way?
(Half-beat.)
---
## ROBYN:
I think I need you to make the distinction for me.
---
## SHARON:
Sorry I'm sorry I said it all wrong.
I just meant
Like, there's a way a man would say to me: you're pretty.
And that would mean I was actually pretty.
And there's a way a woman - a straight woman, I guess
- would say that to me.
34 
And it would mean that she felt sorry for me.
And I don't really know what it means when a lesbian
person says that to me because I haven't ever really
known any lesbian people before, except for -
---
## ROBYN:
Your son's girlfriend.
---
## SHARON:
Right.
---
## ROBYN:
Right.
---
## SHARON:
And she didn't like me.
I think she thought I was boring.
And possibly judgmental but I don't think I was
judgmental
I didn't feel judgmental I just felt confused.
Am I high?
Maybe I think I'm high?
---
## ROBYN:
I think you're just getting relaxed.
Okay. Well.
I said it like: factually, I think you are factually pretty
And I don't feel sorry for you.
But I'm not hitting on you.
---
## SHARON:
Oh! Thank you.
That's very clear.
---
## ROBYN:
Good.
---
## SHARON:
But nuanced.
---
## ROBYN:
Yes.
---
## SHARON:
But now it's clear. Thank you.
---
## ROBYN:
You ' r e welcome.OCCCC
(A beat. They smoke.)
We should turn some music on.
---
## SHARON:
Music?
---
## ROBYN:
Ye a h .
No?
---
## SHARON:
I don't really listen to music?
(Beat.)
I have this CD...
nrCMCMCOOrinnOrnfln
 35
My son sent it to me
for Christmas one year
he couldn't come home so
in the mornings I'd make breakfast
and just play that CD.
---
## ROBYN:
Let's hear it.
---
## SHARON:
Okay.
Okay!
(She presses "play" on an old CD player
nestled on a shelf Her CD plays - a
sentimental song that's SO TERRIBLE, but
also, it kind of moves us, in a way we will
never admit to later. Possibly Mary Chapin
Carpenter.)
(They listen to the CD and get high.)
I've never
you know [smoked pot]
with anyone
I mean obviously because I've never [smoked pot]
but
this is really nice.
No wonder all the kids do drugs.
Oops.
Sorry.
Medicinal...
drugs.
---
## ROBYN:
(Laughing.) "All the kids" don't
---
## SHARON:
Don't they?
---
## ROBYN:
Not all.
---
## SHARON:
Well they should.
All of them maybe should.
Also, I should've been in a band.
---
## ROBYN:
A band!
---
## SHARON:
Were you ever in a band?
36 
I bet you were in a band.
---
## ROBYN:
Sort of, when I was in college.
---
## SHARON:
I lmew it!!
---
## ROBYN:
I told this girl that I was in a band to impress her.
Then she asked me out, and I actually had to be in a
band.
(They're laughing together. Then:)
---
## SHARON:
(Very gently.) Where's your child?
---
## ROBYN:
What?
---
## SHARON:
Or children.
(A beat. ROBYN could say anything. Then she
gets up, decisively.)
---
## ROBYN:
We need new music.
(She gets her iPhone. She plays some kind of
faster, grittier music. Maybe Patti Smith's
"Dancing Barefoot.,
---
## SHARON:
...What is that?
---
## ROBYN:
New music.
(She starts to dance.)
(A beat. SHARON gets up too. She dances.)
(Both women dance in the kitchen, by them-
selves, but together.)

(Next day. Kitchen.)
(---
## ROBYN:
on the landline.)
(She looks over her shoulder.)
(She doesn't want to be overheard.)
(She takes a deep breath.)
---
## ROBYN:
Hello!
Ye s , uh
yes I'm calling for Amanda.
Well
C.when will she be back?
Oh.
Well.
Did she give you any sort of
ball-park idea of -
No no
that's okay
I'll just
I'll try again.
(She hangs up. A beat.)
(A deep breath. Resolve!)
(She picks up the phone again. Dials.)
Hi. Yes. I'm calling back.
Ye s , for Amanda.
C.Ye s I know you said that
but we both know she told you to say that
and right now she's there
standing behind you
and you're darting her kind of wide-eyed looks
C.like WHAT DO I DO ABOUT THIS
and she's shaking her head
and biting her fingernails
38 
so you know what
I do want to leave a message.
You tell my daughter that I'm doing it.
She thinks I can't do it but I'm doing it.
I'm in Iowa
of all places
so.
That's all.
I'm going to hang up now.
(ROBYN hangs up.)
(A beat. Another deep breath.)
(She goes out on the porch.)
(SHARON enters the kitchen.)
(She doesn't see ROBYN at first.)
(She calls her son.)
(It goes to voicemaild

## SHARON:
Hiii
it's me
your mother
um
it's Saturday morning
I just wanted to make sure you got home okay
from wherever you were
whatever you were doing
with whoever it was
(Beat.)
Also are you still dating that lesbian girl?
(Beat.)
It's okay if you are
(Beat.)
You should visit me!
(Beat.)
9r,OrC)
 39
Also, I just have been thinking
maybe you don't tell me enough things
about your life
and
maybe you don't want to tell me
(which I guess is okay.)
(although I don't know why you wouldn't.)
but I do want to know.
Because
I care.
So.
(Beat - this comes bursting out of her.)
I smoked marijuana last night.
(A frozen moment; she's shocked at herself)
Goodbye.
(She hangs up. A beat.)
(ROBYN comes in from the porch.)
(Startled.) Oh!
---
## ROBYN:
Just me, again.
---
## SHARON:
Good morning.
---
## ROBYN:
Morning.
---
## SHARON:
How'd you sleep?
---
## ROBYN:
Good. You?
---
## SHARON:
(Finds this to be true, as she says it.) Really good.
(A warm beat between them.)
Coffee?
---
## ROBYN:
I'd love some.
---
## SHARON:
Okay!
(The phone rings. They both freeze. Then both
move to it.)
---
## ROBYN:
It's / for me.
---
## SHARON:
Oh god.

(Beat - ROBYN is quizzical:)
---
## SHARON:
I mean, go on.
---
## ROBYN:
(Answers the phone.) Hello?
(It's Sharon's son.)
Oh!
Uh. Hello. Hi.
Oh, this is Robyn, your mother's roommate.
Yeah, nice to meet you as well.
Yeah, your mom is -
(On a sudden whim, SHARON starts shaking
her head frantically. ROBYN pauses, startled.
Head-shaking continues.)
Your mom is not
available
right now.
(Beat.)
Yeah she's busy.
(Beat.)
No, I don't know what she's doing, I just know she's...
(SHARON gestures emphatically: OUT.)
OUT. She. Is OUT. Right now.
What?
Well I guess she must've stepped out right after she
called you.
(Beat - he's asking her something.)
Marijuana?
Your mother?
I have no idea.
You ' l l have to ask her that.
Okay.
Okay.
You too.

(ROBYN hangs up.)
(A beat. Co-conspirators. Then:)
You told him you smoked pot?
---
## SHARON:
I didn't mean to
I meant to say something else
some bullshit Mom thing
stay safe, be careful, don't ride the subway at night
and then I said that. Instead.
(Beat.)
---
## ROBYN:
He sounds nice.
---
## SHARON:
He does?
---
## ROBYN:
Ye a h .
He had a nice voice.
(Beat.)
---
## SHARON:
I'm always home in the mornings.
He's going to ask where I was.
---
## ROBYN:
(Shrugs.) You were out.
---
## SHARON:
I don't really go out.
---
## ROBYN:
(Teasing her.) But I hear there's poetry classes and
hot yoga and
---
## SHARON:
- Okay okay -
---
## ROBYN:
Cultural [things]
---
## SHARON:
I go to the book club.
And the store. On Thursdays.
---
## ROBYN:
The store?
---
## SHARON:
I work at a gift shop. Just on Thursdays. It's nice.
Maybe I'll say I went in today as well. Early.
---
## ROBYN:
Tell him you were on a date.
---
## SHARON:
What?
---
## ROBYN:
Ye a h . A date.
---
## SHARON:
N
A-!
On a Saturday morning?
42 
---
## ROBYN:
Breakfast date.
---
## SHARON:
Oh man.
---
## ROBYN:
You met him online. He asked you to breakfast.
What.
---
## SHARON:
Online?
---
## ROBYN:
Don't tell me you never...
(She sees SHARON hasn't.)
You never?
---
## SHARON:
There are serial killers online.
---
## ROBYN:
Oh my god.
Time-out. Time.
You have never been on an internet date.
---
## SHARON:
No!! Have you??
---
## ROBYN:
Yes!
---
## SHARON:
Oh!
(Beat.)
There aren't any women serial killers though. So that's
different.
---
## ROBYN:
When was the last time you were on a date?
---
## SHARON:
When I got married! And we all saw how well
that turned out!
---
## ROBYN:
Okay.
Okay.
We have to remedy this.
---
## SHARON:
No we don't. Nope.
---
## ROBYN:
Sharon. You have to stop thinking about yourself
as basically dead.
You are actually younger than most U.S. presidents.
You are young enough that, if you were a president, you
would be a young president.
Okay?
So just. Stop mummifying yourself.
(A beat. This strikes SHARON all the way to
the heart. After a moment:)

---
## SHARON:
I'd go on a date if you went.
---
## ROBYN:
What! Oh no no no
---
## SHARON:
Like a double
---
## ROBYN:
I am not going on your date with you!
---
## SHARON:
Like a double-date, what
---
## ROBYN:
Awkward! That shit was awkward in college, it's
awkward now!
---
## SHARON:
Someone with a sister
---
## ROBYN:
No! No no
---
## SHARON:
We could all get coffee together
---
## ROBYN:
No! I will help screen the applicants so that you do
not find yourself sitting across from a serial killer,
but I'm not gonna come along and have coffee with
his sister!
---
## SHARON:
You ' d help me screen them?
---
## ROBYN:
Ye a h I could do that.
---
## SHARON:
I don't know how to set up a.. .page. A home page.
---
## ROBYN:
A profile.
I could help you do that.
---
## SHARON:
How come you know all these things?
(A beat.)
---
## ROBYN:
I used to run a lot of businesses.
---
## SHARON:
You did?
---
## ROBYN:
Ye a h .
---
## SHARON:
What kind of businesses?
---
## ROBYN:
Businesses that helped people with personal things.
---
## SHARON:
I didn't know that.
---
## ROBYN:
We're just getting to know each other. There's a lot
you don't know.
---
## SHARON:
(Doesn't mean to say this.) I'm glad you're here,
Robyn.
(ROBYN is moved, and this makes her
awkward. A beat. Then:)
---
## ROBYN:
I'll just...
44 
I forgot my glasses.
(She leaves the room.)
(A beat. SHARON drinks coffee.)
(The phone rings. SHARON considers.)
(She considers. She sighs.)
(SHARON picks it up.)
---
## SHARON:
Hi.
(Beat; it's not her son.)
Excuse me?
No, this is Sharon. Who's calling please?
Amanda, I think you have the wrong number.
No, there isn't anyone here by that name.
Victoria, there's no Victoria -
What?
No, I'm not...
I just said, there's no Victoria here.
You have the wrong number, dear.
What do you mean she just called you from -
(A beat.)
I don't know what to tell you.
I have to go.
(SHARON hangs up.)
(She sits for a second.)
(She opens her mouth.)
(She closes it.)
(A beat.)
(ROBYN returns.)
---
## ROBYN:
Did I hear the phone?
---
## SHARON:
It was
just
my son.

I couldn't talk.
I was going on a date.

(Later that morning.)
(The porch. Robyn's boxes still stacked.)
(SHARON goes through her things.)
(She doesn't know exactly what she's looking
for, but she knows there's something.)
---
## SHARON:
(Reading the box labels.) Kitchen supplies
odds and ends
books
okay
cook books
really?
you don't cook
I've never seen you
winter clothes
okay
Antiques
I like Antiques
clothes
(She opens the clothing box.)
(Looks at Robyn's clothes. Takes them out.)
(Beat.)
(Beat.)
(Puts on a hat.)
(Beat.)
(Puts on a jacket.)
(Models.)
(She tries on Robyn's clothes. She feels power-
ful in them.)
(She moves around the porch in them.)
(Clears her throat. Sort of as Robyn:)

I'm a poet.
I write poems.
Here's a poem.
(Silently pretends to recite The Best Poem
That Has Ever Been Written.)
Thank you.
Thank you.
An autograph?
Oh my.
I suppose I could.
(SHARON keeps going through the clothing
box. Then: she double-takes.)
Oh.
(She reaches in. She pulls out a fistful of
driver's licenses. Beat. Another fistful. She
reads the names, dropping them back into the
box.)
Claire Jones.
Claire Doyle.
Sarah Lucas.
Victoria Lucas.
Robyn Doyle.
Victoria Jones.
(Beat. More fisffiLls of driver's licenses, she
drops them back without reading them, beat.)
Oh.

(SHARON sits at the kitchen table.)
(She waits for Robyn to get home.)
(Key in the lock.)
(ROBYN enters.)

## ROBYN:
Oh!
Hey!
---
## SHARON:
Hi.
---
## ROBYN:
How was your day?
---
## SHARON:
Good
how was yours?
---
## ROBYN:
I went to the Farmer's Market on
what is that street
the one with the parking garage
---
## SHARON:
Gilbert
---
## ROBYN:
Ye a h , Gilbert! I bought a necklace
there was this woman selling these necklaces she'd
made
out of hemp I think, she grew it herself, and these clay
beads,
do you know who I'm talking about? Is she maybe in
your book club or something?
---
## SHARON:
How come you have so many driver's licenses?
(A real beat.)
---
## ROBYN:
Excuse me?
---
## SHARON:
I asked how come -?
---
## ROBYN:
Did you go through my stuff??
---
## SHARON:
I was looking for
a hat
---
## ROBYN:
A hat?
---
## SHARON:
My head was
nnnnnCCnOnOnnflnn
 49
cold.
---
## ROBYN:
A hat in my stuff?
---
## SHARON:
It said "clothes."
I thought, maybe Robyn has a hat.
---
## ROBYN:
Okay.
Wow.
---
## SHARON:
I'm sorry.
I don't mean it like...
you shouldn't have a hundred driver's licenses
but also
why do you have them?
---
## ROBYN:
Because.
Because I do. I collect them.
---
## SHARON:
They're all you, but with different names.
---
## ROBYN:
Right.
---
## SHARON:
And different addresses and different birthdays.
---
## ROBYN:
I mean did you examine every single one?
---
## SHARON:
Who's Amanda?
(A real beat.)
---
## ROBYN:
Did she call?
---
## SHARON:
Yeah.
She asked for Victoria.
Who is she?
---
## ROBYN:
Is this twenty questions? Are we doing the
roommate get-to-know-you thing, or is this twenty
questions, or is this an interrogation?
---
## SHARON:
I'm not interrogating -
---
## ROBYN:
Do you want me to leave?
---
## SHARON:
I'm not asking you to leave!
(Beat.)
Should I be asking you to leave?
(Beat.)
---
## ROBYN:
No.

(Beat.)
---
## SHARON:
Then I'm not.
(Beat.)
Are you hungry?
---
## ROBYN:
Am I...?
---
## SHARON:
No dairy No meat. I made vegetables.
---
## ROBYN:
What did you make?
---
## SHARON:
I just kind of cut them up and cooked them. I
don't know.
You don't have to...
---
## ROBYN:
I'll try some.
(Beat. SHARON gets her a bowl of vegetables.)
(They sit. Eventually)
Have you talked to anyone about this?
---
## SHARON:
"This"?
---
## ROBYN:
This
me
this
---
## SHARON:
No!
Who would I -?
No
---
## ROBYN:
Okay.

## SHARON:
What should I not be telling people?
---
## ROBYN:
Nothing. There's nothing to not-tell.
I came here for some peace and quiet.
---
## SHARON:
Look, I'm not trying to
I don't mean to
I like you
(This surprises them both, greatly.)
(A beat.)
What I mean is
it's nice
to have a friend.
flninnrinrOrnnnnOnnn

---
## ROBYN:
Are we friends?
---
## SHARON:
Aren't we?
---
## ROBYN:
I thought we were roommates.
House, housemates
---
## SHARON:
We are.
But
then you got me high so
now we're friends.
(A beat. Amused despite herselfi)
---
## ROBYN:
Is that how it works?
---
## SHARON:
That's how it seems to work when the kids do it.
---
## ROBYN:
(Laughs, then sobers.) All right
if we're friends
don't go through my shit.
---
## SHARON:
I didn't mean to
---
## ROBYN:
Ye a h I know you wanted a hat
if you want a hat, buy a damn hat
---
## SHARON:
Okay
(Beat.)
Is Amanda your daughter?
---
## ROBYN:
Jesus Christ.
---
## SHARON:
I'm very nosy and I'm very persistent
it's something that has always irritated my son
but inescapable, in our line of work
---
## ROBYN:
(Alarmed.) Line of work!
---
## SHARON:
Being a mother?
(Beat.)
---
## ROBYN:
Yes.
---
## SHARON:
Yes?
---
## ROBYN:
Yes.
You are correct.
Amanda is my daughter.
Yes.
52 
---
## SHARON:
Oh.
(Beat.)
What's your name actually?
---
## ROBYN:
Robyn.
---
## SHARON:
But... Victoria? And Clare? And...?
---
## ROBYN:
Those were also my names, actually, when they
were actually my names.
---
## SHARON:
But what were you born as?
---
## ROBYN:
I was born as a malleable, changeable template.
(Beat.)
---
## SHARON:
Is that a poem?
---
## ROBYN:
No.
(Beat.)
---
## SHARON:
I guess what I'm asking is,
Are you doing something illegal?
---
## ROBYN:
Right now?
---
## SHARON:
Or like. ..recently.
Or...ongoingly.
Or like...were you?
(A beat.)
---
## ROBYN:
Yes.
Yes I was, Sharon.
---
## SHARON:
Oh!
(A beat.)OCC
What was it?
---
## ROBYN:
If you ask me that
and I tell you
it makes you an accomplice
so.
(Beat.)
---
## SHARON:
(Trying the word out.) An accomplice.
(Beat.)
OrnCrOCCOOnOnC)fl
 53
What did you do?
---
## ROBYN:
Sharon.
---
## SHARON:
Yeah?
---
## ROBYN:
I'm going to go outside and have a cigarette.
And you think about whether or not you want me to
answer that.
And when I come back, you can ask it again.
Or
we can finish dinner
and make an online dating profile for you,
and go to bed
and tomorrow will be a whole new day
in which this question does not exist.
(She gets up and starts to leave to the porch.)
---
## SHARON:
Are you really gonna quit smoking, or is that like
part of this whole
multiple personality thing?
---
## ROBYN:
I, as me, as myself, am going to quit
as soon as I have this next, last,
cigarette.
(ROBYN goes outside.)
(A beat.)
(SHARON wants to do so many things!)
(She gets up she sits down she gets up she
opens her mouth she sits down she goes to the
phone checking nervously over her shoulder.)
(ROBYN isn't looking.)
(She calls her son.)
(Voicemail!)
(She has no idea what she's going to say.)
(She sort of listens to herself stumble through
the usual set of communications, while
wondering if she's going to tell him what's
54 
happening:)
---
## SHARON:
Hi
it's me
your mother
um
I just wanted to see how you're doing!
I just
am thinking about you and
I think you should visit.
I think we should visit each other.
When I told you I smoked marijuana?
I was kidding.
•••
I went on a date.
Actually, I wasn't kidding.
I did smoke marijuana.
But I'm not smoking it right now.
•••
I didn't go on a date.
I did go on a date.
•••
My roommate is very
she's very
there's something very
about her
the thing is
•••
she's an interesting person.
(SHARON is so surprised! She didn't expect to
say this! But it's true.)
She knows things.
She does things.
Everybody always told me not to do things.
Your father never [understood me]
nnr1nnOnCMOn
 55
And my mother! She always said Don't.
Is that how you feel about me?
Am I a person who says to you: Don't?
(Beat - maybe she doesn't want that answered.)
Robyn just says: Do. And then she does.
(The voicemail cuts her off)
Are you there?
Are you...?
Oh.
(She calls back, voicemail.)
Your machine cut me off.
I won't keep you too long.
I just wanted to say that
I'm very
happy
and
that's all.
Goodbye.
(She hangs up.)
(ROBYN is standing in the doorway.)
(A beat between them.)
---
## ROBYN:
I finished my cigarette.
---
## SHARON:
(With real resolve.) What do you do, Robyn?
---
## ROBYN:
Did.
---
## SHARON:
What did you do?
(A beat. Okay.)
---
## ROBYN:
I took people's money.
---
## SHARON:
Like. You robbed them?
---
## ROBYN:
Yes.
---
## SHARON:
You mugged them?
---
## ROBYN:
No. I convinced them to give me their money.
---
## SHARON:
That doesn't sound illegal.
56 
---
## ROBYN:
Under false pretenses.
I called them up. Old people. Mostly.
They could donate to save the whales or the orphans or
the ozone layer. Whatever.
And they did.
And it all went to me.
---
## SHARON:
(Horrified...but also impressed.) You did that?
---
## ROBYN:
Yeah.
But that wasn't enough money.
So then I started telling people they'd won things.
People are a lot more willing to risk when there's
tangible reward.
And to collect the prize, they'd have to provide
information.
---
## SHARON:
Are you the Nigerians?
---
## ROBYN:
Sorry?
---
## SHARON:
All those emails from Princess whaesit
trying to store her millions in my whatever -
were those actually from you?
---
## ROBYN:
Oh! No. I'm much more detail-oriented. Precise.
Grammatic.
---
## SHARON:
But that's the general idea.
---
## ROBYN:
That's the general idea, yes.
(A beat as SHARON takes this all in.)
Do you want me to stop telling you?
---
## SHARON:
No,
go on.
---
## ROBYN:
...So that happened for a while.
And it was actually substantially lucrative.
---
## SHARON:
What about your daughter??
Did she know?
---
## ROBYN:
We teach our children whatever skill-sets we have,
Sharon. Didn't you?
---
## SHARON:
You taught your daughter how to scam people?
 57


---
## ROBYN:
She's the one who came up with the driver's license
thing.
We started manufacturing fake IDs, and then she'd sell
them at school.
But that wasn't until college.
---
## SHARON:
Your daughter is a con-artist?
---
## ROBYN:
My daughter is an intelligent and resourceful
young woman.
(A beat.)
---
## SHARON:
I don't know.
---
## ROBYN:
What.
---
## SHARON:
What you said.. .before.
I don't know if I gave my son any kind of...
skill-set.
---
## ROBYN:
He sounds successful.
---
## SHARON:
I think he might have done that on his own.
Or, worse, in spite of me.
We're not close.
Why aren't we close?
---
## ROBYN:
Well. Amanda and I aren't close either.

---
## SHARON:
You scammed people together.
You were con-artists together.
You were like Bonnie and Clyde, but mother and
daughter.
That's so... I don't know! Close!
---
## ROBYN:
We have to give our kids things, and they have to
reject those things.
At some point.
Amanda temps at a law firm now and she wears these
little power-suits
and she tells everybody that her mother lives in another
country
so all of her boyfriends bring her home for the holidays
and their mothers are extra sympathetic because her
own is
58 
so far away.
So.
(A beat.)
---
## SHARON:
I'm sorry.
---
## ROBYN:
It's fine.
---
## SHARON:
It's not fine.
(Beat.)
---
## ROBYN:
She doesn't think I can give it up. The lifestyle.
She doesn't want to talk to me anymore, but if she
talked to me, she'd see that I can give it up. I mean,
I'm in Iowa. Ta l k about giving up.
---
## SHARON:
(Hey.)
---
## ROBYN:
Also, I sold pot. But you probably figured that out
already.
---
## SHARON:
(Wide-eyed.) No, I didn't.
---
## ROBYN:
You didn't?
---
## SHARON:
No! How would I figure that out??
---
## ROBYN:
(Genuinely impressed.) Wow. What planet are you
from?
---
## SHARON:
Iowa?
---
## ROBYN:
Wow. Iowa.
---
## SHARON:
Actually Illinois, though.
---
## ROBYN:
Right. I remember.
---
## SHARON:
Not quite the Land of Giving Up.
---
## ROBYN:
I was
talking about me, not you
maybe also you, but mostly me.
---
## SHARON:
You sold pot?
---
## ROBYN:
Not too often. Just because I don't really have a
grow-house or anything.
And growing pot for real, that's a commitment, it
requires a lot of specifics.
But I have definitely sold it. And that has also,
sporadically, definitely been lucrative.
 59
C.
C.---
## SHARON:
Did Amanda sell pot?
---
## ROBYN:
(With some pride.) She paid her way through
college.
---
## SHARON:
Wow.
---
## ROBYN:
(Really proud.) And she has a green thumb, I mean
I'm not bad with plants but she's got a real talent.
Ye a h .
---
## SHARON:
(Impressed.) That's great.
---
## ROBYN:
It is.
(Beat.)
She refuses to talk about any of that now.
When we talk, which is not often, she wants to keep
things "present-tense
She says her therapist told her to do that.
And I'm like, what kind of a therapist refuses to speak
in the past tense?
Things happened. They accumulated. We became.
Or the future, for that matter. We will become.
But no. Amanda says, "Today I am eating a sandwich. I
am grocery shopping."
She says, "We are avoiding conflict:'
(Half-beat.)

I don't think conflict is a bad thing.
---
## SHARON:
You know my son does that too
the present-tense thing
I don't know if anybody told him to do it
But I'll be like, "Remember when I visited you and we
had fun?"
And he'll be like, "It's sunny today. It's cloudy today."
(A contemplative beat, then:)
What else did you do?
---
## ROBYN:
I mean, I did just a little bit of auto-theft, but
---
## SHARON:
YOU WHAT.
---
## ROBYN:
(With growing pride.) But it's a lot of work
6


high risk
you have to be really really good at it
and that takes time
like a real commitment to craft
---
## SHARON:
Okay yeah I mean yeah I imagine
---
## ROBYN:
And you have to spend real time building the right
networks
and people have to trust you
if you're going to buy stolen property you have to trust
the seller
---
## SHARON:
Sure okay
---
## ROBYN:
And I was good
buyers trusted me
and you might not know this from looking at me but

I'm very very good with cars
both jacking them and stripping them down

some people don't do well under pressure and
I don't want to brag, but I would say that I sort of
thrive
in those contexts
but
finally in the end
auto-theft just ended up not being time-cost effective.
You know?
---
## SHARON:
Right!
..Why not?
---
## ROBYN:
...Well
because we moved a lot, we had to move a lot
so you build a network of buyers and then you abandon
it,
sort of before you've closed the deal.
It becomes wasteful. And ultimately too risky

---
## SHARON:
Are people chasing you?
---
## ROBYN:
Right now?
---
## SHARON:
Yes, right now!!
nn
 61
---
## ROBYN:
I don't think they are right now, no.
---
## SHARON:
You don't think?
---
## ROBYN:
I'm fairly certain that right now nobody is chasing
me.
---
## SHARON:
How certain?
---
## ROBYN:
Fairly.
(A beat.)
---
## SHARON:
Are you doing something right now? Here?
---
## ROBYN:
I just got here.
---
## SHARON:
(A real question.) Are you scamming me?
---
## ROBYN:
You?
---
## SHARON:
Me.
---
## ROBYN:
You haven't given me any money! How am I
scamming you?
---
## SHARON:
I don't know, I don't know if you are
I'm just asking.
---
## ROBYN:
Do you feel like I'm scamming you?
---
## SHARON:
I mean I don't know
Maybe my jewelry is missing or
maybe you've photocopied my credit cards or something
Have you?
I don't know
Have you?
---
## ROBYN:
No.
---
## SHARON:
No?
---
## ROBYN:
No. I have not.
---
## SHARON:
Promise?
---
## ROBYN:
I mean, I promise but
do you believe me?
(Beat. SHARON looks at her. Then:)
---
## SHARON:
Yeah.
---
## ROBYN:
Ye a h ?
---
## SHARON:
I do believe you. Yes.
62 
(Beat between them.)
---
## ROBYN:
So that's me.
(Beat.)
Are you having a nervous breakdown?
(Beat.)
---
## SHARON:
Show me how to do it.
---
## ROBYN:
What?
---
## SHARON:
I want to do it.
What you did.
---
## ROBYN:
No!
---
## SHARON:
Why not?
---
## ROBYN:
Because...!
---
## SHARON:
Because what?
---
## ROBYN:
Because I'm done with all that.
---
## SHARON:
I'm not asking you to do it, just to show me how.
(A real beat.)
(ROBYN takes her in. Then:)
---
## ROBYN:
Show you how what, exactly?
---
## SHARON:
The phone thing.
---
## ROBYN:
I don't do the phone thing anymore.
---
## SHARON:
I bet I'd be good, talking to somebody on the phone.
---
## ROBYN:
I don't do any of this anymore.
---
## SHARON:
Like you don't smoke anymore?

(Beat.)
---
## ROBYN:
That's not fair.
---
## SHARON:
I'm sorry
---
## ROBYN:
Those are entirely different things.
---
## SHARON:
I know.
You ' r e right, I know.
Look. All I'm saying is
how
exactly
rMn'n
63
did you do it -
when you did it
(which you no longer do)?
(Beat.)
---
## ROBYN:
Well.
There's a few ways.
Either you're asking them for something
or you're telling them something.
---
## SHARON:
Okay...
---
## ROBYN:
Like, maybe you're telling them that something
they value is about to expire.
Auto insurance. Home insurance. Their cable. Whatever.
And you have a deal, and it's kind of an amazing one-
time deal, but it's ending in twenty-four hours. You
just caught them at the tail end of this deal.
---
## SHARON:
Right.
---
## ROBYN:
So they better decide fast if they want to save sixty
percent on their phone bill.
Or upgrade to a new twice-as-fast high-speed internet
connection.
---
## SHARON:
That sounds easy. I could do that.
---
## ROBYN:
But you also have to be personable, keep them on
the line until you get their credit card.
It's easy to hang up a phone.
---
## SHARON:
I'm personable.
---
## ROBYN:
It's harder than you think.
---
## SHARON:
It doesn't sound that hard.
---
## ROBYN:
Oh really!
Ring ring. I'm gonna pick up.
(She "picks up.")
Hello?
---
## SHARON:
Wait, are we pretending?
---
## ROBYN:
(We're seeing how good you are)
Hello, who is this?
64 
---
## SHARON:
This is Sharon.
---
## ROBYN:
I don't know any Sharons.
---
## SHARON:
My name is Sharon, and I'm calling about your...
uh
your
life insurance.
Which is about to expire.
---
## ROBYN:
It is?
---
## SHARON:
(Helpfully.) You are about to expire.
---
## ROBYN:
Let's start with something easier.
You ' r e calling me about my cable bill. Isn't it high?
Wouldn't I like it to be lower?
---
## SHARON:
Isn't it high?
---
## ROBYN:
I guess it is a little...
---
## SHARON:
Wouldn't you like it to be lower?
---
## ROBYN:
Are you trying to sell me something?
(They get suspicious.)
Are you trying to sell me something I don't want,
Sharon?
---
## SHARON:
I'm calling because
there's a deal and it's about to end
and you're lucky, you are a lucky person
because first of all, there aren't that many deals in life
life is mostly about being charged the full amount
and second of all, timing is everything.
A bullet is a bullet and your head is your head and
if two seconds separate those things
well
those two seconds saved your life.
So.
How would you like to pay less for your cable?
(A beat. ROBYN is actually impressed.)
---
## ROBYN:
I'd like that a lot.
---
## SHARON:
Okay!

 65


Well that's good.
I'd like that too.
Give me your credit card.
---
## ROBYN:
(Make that sound more official. Anything about
money has to sound official, so they feel safe.)
---
## SHARON:
Please give me your credit card.
---
## ROBYN:
(Breaks the "call.") "The next step requires your
date of birth and your credit card information."
You don't need it, it is required.
---
## SHARON:
You are good at this.

---
## ROBYN:
Yeah, I am, I'm very good at it.
---
## SHARON:
How did I do?
---
## ROBYN:
Generally? You did okay generally
---
## SHARON:
Okay?
---
## ROBYN:
You did pretty okay.
C---
## SHARON:
I was good.
You know I was good.
---
## ROBYN:
You were pretty good.
---
## SHARON:
I was personable. And you liked me.

(Half-beat.)
---
## ROBYN:
Yeah.
Yes. You were.
---
## SHARON:
You did, didn't you.
---
## ROBYN:
Yeah, I liked you.
(A moment between them.)

(The air has shifted suddenly and they both
suddenly feel it, and neither is sure what the
shift is. They're both suddenly uneasy.)
So. That was that.
---
## SHARON:
I want to do it for real.
---
## ROBYN:
Sharon...
C---
## SHARON:
I could do it for real, couldn't I.
(A beat.)

C
C

66 
---
## ROBYN:
I.. .can't.
Not anymore.
---
## SHARON:
You can't? Or you don't want to?
Or you want to, but you think you shouldn't?
(A beat.)
---
## ROBYN:
I'm going to bed.
So.
---
## SHARON:
Look.
To m o r r o w I make one phone call.
Okay? Just one. With you.
And if it doesn't go well, then forget it!
I wasn't cut out for it! We'll forget it!
It'll be like it never happened.
But if it goes well
then
you see how you feel about that.
(A beat.)
---
## ROBYN:
Sharon...
---
## SHARON:
One foot in the grave, who would I even tell.
---
## ROBYN:
Sharon, I told you, you are not old.
---
## SHARON:
I didn't feel old. Just now.
I felt like
I was thriving
and I bet you did too.

(A beat.)
---
## ROBYN:
Good night.
(She leaves.)
nnnn
 67
7.
(Morning. The kitchen.)
(Coffee. Light. French.)
(...French?)
(Yes, SHARON is listening to a French lan-
guage tape as she makes coffee.)
FRENCH TAPE. (Recording.) Repetez s'il vous plait.
Je m'appelle...
---
## SHARON:
Je m'appelle Sharon.
FRENCH TAPE. (Recording.) Comment-allez vous?
---
## SHARON:
Comment-allez vous?
FRENCH TAPE. (Recording.) J'aime Paris.
---
## SHARON:
J'aime Paris.
(ROBYN in the doorway.)
---
## ROBYN:
What are you doing.
---
## SHARON:
Parlez-vous Francais?
---
## ROBYN:
Not to any functional degree, non.
Why are you parlez-ing Francais?
---
## SHARON:
I always wanted to learn.
---
## ROBYN:
You did?
---
## SHARON:
In college I was a member of the French club.
---
## ROBYN:
I didn't know that.
---
## SHARON:
I was going to be a spy. La Femme Sharon.
Or a baker.
...Coffee?
---
## ROBYN:
Yes please.
(SHARON gets her coffee.)
---
## SHARON:
So...
---
## ROBYN:
Yeah?
---
## SHARON:
Have you
you know.
thought about it?
68 
---
## ROBYN:
"It"...
---
## SHARON:
You know...
---
## ROBYN:
Ijust woke up.
---
## SHARON:
I know, I made you coffee.
---
## ROBYN:
So give it a minute, okay?
---
## SHARON:
Okay.
(She sits and watches ROBYN drink her coffee.)
(With baleful focus.)
(Like an iguana.)
---
## ROBYN:
Do you mind.
---
## SHARON:
What.
---
## ROBYN:
You're watching me.
---
## SHARON:
I'm drinking my coffee.
---
## ROBYN:
You are not drinking your coffee
you are watching me.
(SHARON lifts her coffee cup to her mouth.)
(She gives ROBYN an iguana-stare over the lip
of the mug.)
Did you sleep?
---
## SHARON:
Yeah I slept
---
## ROBYN:
Because I heard
French
around five a.m 7
---
## SHARON:
How did you know who to target?
---
## ROBYN:
"Target" I don't use that word "target"
---
## SHARON:
Okay...
---
## ROBYN:
"Identify," I took some time to identify my client base
---
## SHARON:
Okay...
So like...
---
## ROBYN:
Northerners are mean and paranoid
Southerners are nice but suspicious
The west coast is in a state of anarchy
---
## SHARON:
And Iowa?
 69

---
## ROBYN:
The Midwest is always good.
(Beat.)

---
## SHARON:
We could call Tanya.
---
## ROBYN:
Tanya.
---
## SHARON:
She's from Idaho.
---
## ROBYN:
Your friend Tanya?
---
## SHARON:
She's an acquaintance.
---
## ROBYN:
You want to target Tanya.
---
## SHARON:
I am identifying our best client base.
(ROBYN really takes SHARON in. Really in.)

---
## ROBYN:
You ' r e a quick study.
---
## SHARON:
(This compliment means a lot to her.) My mother
Oalways said I was slow.
---
## ROBYN:
(Not meanly.) Your mother was a bitch, I think.
---
## SHARON:
(Startled, not upset.) Excuse me?
---
## ROBYN:
(Still not mean.) I mean it's hard to tell, it was an
earlier time,
sometimes you think: that's just how women were
Otaught to be
but it sounds like your mother was kind of a bitch.
---
## SHARON:
I don't feel comfortable saying that myself but I
really appreciate that you said it.
(A beat.)

---
## ROBYN:
You ' d have to disguise your voice.
An accent of some kind.
---
## SHARON:
I think I could do French.
---
## ROBYN:
Convincingly?
---
## SHARON:
Ta n y a is from Idaho.
---
## ROBYN:
If this goes badly, I never agreed to it.
---
## SHARON:
Understood.

(She goes to the phone. She dials Tanya.)
(ROBYN sits, arms folded, a commanding gen-
eral surveying the troops. SHARON blossoms

under her undivided attention. In the follow-
ing sequence, we see SHARON come fully alive.
In a French accent:)

## SHARON:
Hello?
Ye s , is this Tanya?
Ta n y a , hello, this is
Juliette
DuBois
from The Franco-Global Association for International
Orphans
based in Normandy, France
Ye s
Normandy is a lovely city
there are stone walls and it is right next to the ocean
and long ago people stormed the beaches with great
passion
(ROBYN clears her throat.)
which is all to say
I wonder if you are interested in saving the lives of
starving children
orphans, oui, orphans
in Senegal
in many places, but specifically Senegal
have you been?
It's lovely
the bright colors, the drums, the hats
yes, Senegal is a place of music and motion and hats
and children without parents
- What?
Well
what we do is, we provide orphans with things they
generally lack
like pain au chocolat
and bicycles
and vegetables
nrrnnnOOCM

and small hats
and the right kinds of love.
And love requires money.
All kinds of love, but especially the right kinds.
There can be no love of any kinds
without money.
(Beat - this comes from a personal place.)
(SHARON thinks about her life as she speaks,
and she gets emotional, and it's actually
weirdly honest and raw.)
Think about what it is to be alone.
It is a late night somewhere
wherever you are
and you are alone.
Think about the objects you arrange around you.
But everything is cold under your hand.
And then someone comes into your life.
And you become different.
You find yourself to be...truly...alive.
Think about how one person can change an entire
lifetime
of accumulated coldness and objects and silence.
(Beat - Tanya is affected by this and wants to
help. SHARON makes direct eye contact with

## ROBYN:
speaking with a quiet and inarguable
victory)
Thank you Tanya.
It's people like you who make the difference.
The next step requires your date of birth
and your credit card information.

(The kitchen, two weeks later.)
(The table is cluttered, piled high with French
guidebooks, a stack of new clothes with labels
still on, scattered cash, cigarettes. And...a
record player. It looks like the kitchen ofhigh-
rolling and sophisticated college kids with
money to burn.)
(---
## ROBYN:
at the table, bagging weed.)
(SHARON is on the cordless phone with a
book-club lady. She looks younger, somehow,
more buoyant.)
---
## SHARON:
(To the phone.) Ye s , how much would you like?
Now, was that the herbal mix or the baked goods?
Okay dear, I'll bring it to book club tomorrow.
Bye bye now.
(She hangs up.)
That's another order.
---
## ROBYN:
Boom!
Of the brownies, or...?
---
## SHARON:
The herbal mix.
---
## ROBYN:
(Makes a note in a notebook.) Got it.
They're being discreet?
---
## SHARON:
Like little mice
little Iowan church mice
but I must say, it livens up reading group discussion.
Everybody's got opinions now,
they all interrupt each other.
These days Tanya giggles a lot
we read that book about child soldiers and she just
giggled her way through that.
---
## ROBYN:
(Laughing.) Was that one your pick?
---
## SHARON:
I told you -
nnDOCM
 73
---
## ROBYN:
You ' r e not from here.
---
## SHARON:
/ played the clarinet as a child.
Ta n y a refers to her book club as a -
SHARON & ---
## ROBYN:
- Reading group.
---
## SHARON:
I seem Iowan, but I'm not Iowan, it's my secret
weapon.
---
## ROBYN:
Ye a h I'm learning that about you.
---
## SHARON:
What?
---
## ROBYN:
Your secret weapons.
(A beat between them.)
---
## SHARON:
(Pleased.) You ' r e the one who came home yesterday
with a record player.
---
## ROBYN:
You ' r e the one who never listens to music
It was an act of mercy on my part
---
## SHARON:
I like it.
The record player.
---
## ROBYN:
(Shy.) Ye a h ?
---
## SHARON:
Yeah.
---
## ROBYN:
Cool.
(Beat.)
---
## SHARON:
Robyn?
---
## ROBYN:
Ye a h ?
---
## SHARON:
I was gonna ask you...
---
## ROBYN:
What's up?
---
## SHARON:
Well
I had this idea
this thought
that I wanted to sort of
run by you
---
## ROBYN:
Yes...?
---
## SHARON:
I just have been thinking
that
the book-club ladies have been really really
74 
receptive
to medicinal herbs
---
## ROBYN:
Sure seems like it.
---
## SHARON:
I was talking to Betty -
---
## ROBYN:
The one with the hair-net?
---
## SHARON:
Yes, and she mentioned that her goddaughter
had one of our brownies
---
## ROBYN:
Oh wait a minute
---
## SHARON:
Sort of by accident but
she really enjoyed it
---
## ROBYN:
How old is she?
---
## SHARON:
Twelve?
---
## ROBYN:
OH my god
---
## SHARON:
(It's fine!) and it occurred to me
you know
those kids have a whole demographic available to them
that we don't
and I thought
what if we gave Betty's goddaughter some
supplies
to off-load
---
## ROBYN:
Hold up.
Hold up.
You want Betty's twelve-year-old goddaughter
to sell pot brownies for us
to her friends.
---
## SHARON:
Or regular pot.
---
## ROBYN:
Sharon!
---
## SHARON:
To her classmates.
---
## ROBYN:
Her classmates?
---
## SHARON:
(Helpfully.) She might not have many actual
friends
she's a little strange-looking
(her teeth, and...)
nnr,Qn
 75
but uh, classmates and
you know, kids she knows from places.
---
## ROBYN:
Okay
Sharon?
Okay
listen
---
## SHARON:
And I know you might have concerns
---
## ROBYN:
"Concerns"
yes, yes I do
concerns
---
## SHARON:
But I just think,
let's think about this.
Expansion is progress.
So. Let's consider.
(A beat.)
---
## ROBYN:
"Expansion is progress"
Where did you even...?
---
## SHARON:
I read that.
---
## ROBYN:
Youread it.
---
## SHARON:
I was reading this article in Harvard Business
Review
yesterday
about women entrepreneurs
and they all said Expansion is progress.
Because women settle for things,
we nurture, nurturing requires settlement
to some degree
but
we deserve progress too.
Don't you think?
(A beat.)
---
## ROBYN:
Since when do you read Harvard Business Review?
---
## SHARON:
I want to know what's going on.
---
## ROBYN:
...By reading Harvard Business Review?
76 
---
## SHARON:
What!
(Pause - refocusing:)
---
## ROBYN:
Sharon... I don't think off-loading pot brownies
to Betty's adolescent buck-toothed goddaughter
is going to provide progress, entrepreneurial or
otherwise. And you know, low profile, Sharon
we are keeping a low profile
we are not expanding a business.
Sustaining and expanding are two different activities
and it's great that now you read Harvard Business
Review
but expanding is no longer an interest of mine.
(Beat.)
---
## SHARON:
And then there's this other thing.
---
## ROBYN:
What other thing...
---
## SHARON:
Well.
I got us something.
---
## ROBYN:
What?
---
## SHARON:
And it's sort of just in case.
We don't need it now
so I don't think we should think that we need it now
but I just thought, it's good to be prepared.
---
## ROBYN:
What did you buy.
(SHARON goes to a large shopping bag.)
(She takes out a large gun.)
Sharon.
---
## SHARON:
I went to the Walmart in Cedar Rapids
---
## ROBYN:
WHAT THE FUCK!
---
## SHARON:
And there was a nice young man who [sold me
this]
---
## ROBYN:
Do you even know how to use a gun??
---
## SHARON:
I've been watching videos on YouTube
it doesn't look hard.
nnn
 77
---
## ROBYN:
Sharon!
We cannot own a gun.
---
## SHARON:
This is Iowa, everybody owns a gun.
---
## ROBYN:
Okay
a hunting rifle
if you hunted
okay
but this
sort of phallic
semi-automatic...
what is this?
---
## SHARON:
Do you wanna hold it?
It's got a weight to it
it feels warm
like you're holding a sort of pet or
somebody's limb
or your own extra limb
---
## ROBYN:
Sharon!
---
## SHARON:
What?
---
## ROBYN:
Ta k e it back.
---
## SHARON:
What??
---
## ROBYN:
Do you have the receipt?
Ta k e it back.
---
## SHARON:
(Canny.) Hold it and I'll look for the receipt.
(A beat.)
(ROBYN holds the gun.)
(SHARON knows exactly where her receipt is
and takes her sweet time looking for it.)
What's it feel like?
---
## ROBYN:
Heavy.
---
## SHARON:
Powerful?
---
## ROBYN:
Dangerous.
---
## SHARON:
But doesn't it feel good?
78 
(Pause.)
---
## SHARON:
I walked out of that Walmart
and I knew that everybody who looked at me
was looking through me
but I knew what they weren't seeing.
I knew what I had.
(Beat.)
---
## ROBYN:
Find your receipt?
---
## SHARON:
Still looking.
---
## ROBYN:
We're not gonna shoot anybody.
Who did you wanna shoot?
---
## SHARON:
I don't want to shoot anybody
I just want to be prepared.
---
## ROBYN:
Prepared to shoot?
---
## SHARON:
Just prepared.
---
## ROBYN:
Take it back. Okay? Sharon?
---
## SHARON:
Okay.
---
## ROBYN:
Promise?
---
## SHARON:
I said okay.
I will.
Robyn, I will.
---
## ROBYN:
Okay and just
in general, Sharon,
this is not...
expansion...is not...
Okay?
---
## SHARON:
Okay.
---
## ROBYN:
This is just
as this is.
No bigger.
---
## SHARON:
No smaller?
---
## ROBYN:
Just as we are.
---
## SHARON:
I like how we are.
nnnnOnC

(Beat.)
Found it.
---
## ROBYN:
Ye a h ?
---
## SHARON:
Right here.
---
## ROBYN:
Okay.

## SHARON:
Are we good?
---
## ROBYN:
We're good.

(Evening, one week later.)
(The kitchen.)
(Music on the record player.)
(ROBYN stands with the box of dolls. She has
a large garbage bag. She seems to be about to
throw them out, and then...)
(The sound of SHARON approaching.)
(ROBYN quickly hides the box.)
(SHARON comes into the kitchen from the out-
side.)
(She is Dressed. Up.)
(And a teeny little bit drunk.)
(And it's pretty hot.)
---
## ROBYN:
Oh hey look who's home!
---
## SHARON:
There you are!
---
## ROBYN:
(Taking in the ouffit.) Whoa. Whoa mama.
Look at you.
---
## SHARON:
Right? Whaddayou think?
---
## ROBYN:
Bold. Bold choice.
---
## SHARON:
Right?!
(Beat.)
Bold good or bold bad?
(She grabs a joint off the table, lights it.)
---
## ROBYN:
Bold is.. .bold. It exists above the dictates of good
and evil.
(Beat.)
That's for your book club, you know we don't smoke
that.
---
## SHARON:
It's just a little bit.
Do you want me to put this out?
C.
CI 81
---
## ROBYN:
No, just - next time -
(Beat.)
SO.
---
## SHARON:
(Can't wait to be asked.) Yeeeees?
---
## ROBYN:
How was your date?
---
## SHARON:
WELL.
(This is a good thing!)
He's an ophthalmologist!
---
## ROBYN:
Okay...
---
## SHARON:
Eyes, that's eyes.
He knows about eyes.
---
## ROBYN:
Ye a h okay, eyes.
---
## SHARON:
(This is not a good thing...) He's going bald...
---
## ROBYN:
Bald, okay.
---
## SHARON:
(Not sure how she feels about this.) He was a child
star?
---
## ROBYN:
What kind?
---
## SHARON:
Gerber food commercial.
---
## ROBYN:
Hmm.
---
## SHARON:
His experiences with fame haunted him. To this
day.
---
## ROBYN:
Fame! Okay!
Overall verdict?
(Beat.)
---
## SHARON:
And he kissed me.
---
## ROBYN:
You mean like an end-of-night kiss
or like a Kiss?
---
## SHARON:
Well we kissed on the cheek when I first arrived
at the restaurant
but those don't count
(I mean in Paris everybody kisses each other on the
cheek all the time.)
but after dinner
C.

82 

we made out.
In the car.
And he was very passionate
he kept bumping me into things
like the gear shift because he drives stick.
---
## ROBYN:
Well done!
---
## SHARON:
I don't think I ever really did that as a teenager.
Like, forty years late, I made out in a car.

(Beat.)
And he put his
hand
on my
(Breasts.)
you know

---
## ROBYN:
Oh-kay, I don't think we need to
---
## SHARON:
And he squeezed
---
## ROBYN:
Oh-kay
---
## SHARON:
And I just thought
is this what all the fuss is about?
---
## ROBYN:
...What?
---
## SHARON:
I just. I don't know. I was bored.
---
## ROBYN:
You were making out in a car!
You were banging into the gear shift!
He was squeezing various parts of you!
How were you bored?

---
## SHARON:
It just felt like
I don't know
he was so.. .normal.
He told me I was pretty.
It was very unambiguous.
He had kids, he showed me pictures of them.
They looked like kids.
---
## ROBYN:
Sharon! You went on a nice date



OnnOnr 9
 83
with a man who was NOT a serial killer -
---
## SHARON:
I sort of just started entertaining myself
after a time.
---
## ROBYN:
What does that mean?
(SHARON takes a series of objects out of her
pocket: cigarettes, a fancy lighter.)
---
## SHARON:
I took these out of his pocket while we were
kissing.
---
## ROBYN:
You -!
---
## SHARON:
(With pride.) He didn't even notice.
---
## ROBYN:
Yourobbed him
while he was kissing you.
---
## SHARON:
He won't miss them
It's just cigarettes
---
## ROBYN:
And a nice lighter!
---
## SHARON:
A lighter is a lighter.
---
## ROBYN:
That's not the point and you know it.
---
## SHARON:
When I was a girl I stole a penny candy from the
store
and my mother slapped me across the face.
She said, "Little girls don't take what isn't theirs."
And you know what?
She was right.
It takes a grown lady to do that.
(Despite herself; ROBYN is laughing.)
---
## ROBYN:
Sharon!!
---
## SHARON:
(Takes out a watch, sets it on the table.) Right off
his wrist, and he didn't notice.
Turns out, I'm good. Who knew!
---
## ROBYN:
Sharon!
---
## SHARON:
What!
---
## ROBYN:
Sharon you cannot just
go on dates with people and
84 
mug them
---
## SHARON:
He wasn't complaining.
---
## ROBYN:
I am complaining! (I think I'm complaining.)
The point is -
---
## SHARON:
The point is, if you'd been on a date with me
I wouldn't have mugged you.
(Beat. The air changes just a little.)
---
## ROBYN:
What does that mean.
---
## SHARON:
I just mean
you're more exciting
than the rest of them.
I wouldn't have had to.
(Beat.)
Are you mad at me?
(Beat.)
He's just a guy
you don't even know him.
(Beat. ROBYN is sober now.)
---
## ROBYN:
Careful. With that.
---
## SHARON:
What!
---
## ROBYN:
"Just a guy."
---
## SHARON:
I mean I didn't kill him.
I didn't like, poison him.
You know?
Everything's fine.
---
## ROBYN:
And the next time you go on a date?
And you get bored?
And it's just a guy?
---
## SHARON:
Don't you think you're overreacting?
(Beat.)
---
## ROBYN:
I meant to give this up.
I really did.
 85
Until you, I did.
---
## SHARON:
Oh...
---
## ROBYN:
Until you
and how it was so
fun
and how you
surprised me
(you always surprise me.)
until that
I really
really
did.
---
## SHARON:
...Thank you.
---
## ROBYN:
It's hard to go back to the normal world.
To getting what you want so slowly, over so much time,
or sometimes to never getting it at all.
You start to need this.
---
## SHARON:
I'm doing this for fun.
---
## ROBYN:
Or you want it so bad it feels like you need it.
---
## SHARON:
I don't need it, Robyn.
---
## ROBYN:
Are you sure?
(Beat. SHARON is not sure.)
---
## SHARON:
(Quiet.) I'm not a kid who doesn't know right
from wrong.
You aren't raising me. Somebody already raised me,
and they did a shitty job
and then I raised somebody and I did a shitty job
and you, generally, all you've done is be a really
Creally
great
roommate.

(Beat.)
(ROBYN almost laughs, but also she's too
sad to laugh. She takes SHARON's joint. She
r--
86 
smokes, and SHARON tries to make out her
expression.)
---
## SHARON:
Robyn.
---
## ROBYN:
What.
---
## SHARON:
Don't be sad.
Are you sad?
Don't be sad.
---
## ROBYN:
(Means it.) I'm glad you had a good date.
---
## SHARON:
Fuck that.
I don't care about that.
---
## ROBYN:
Sharon...
---
## SHARON:
I've had a good month. With you.
I've had good coffee
good conversations
and now we're making good money and that's good
but actually, it's not the money, it's the making.
Making something with you.
---
## ROBYN:
Sharon...
---
## SHARON:
I look forward to waking up in the morning.
Everything is a Yes.
I'm smarter and faster and
younger
than I knew I could be.
Don't be sad. I can't remember ever having been this
happy.
(A beat, and then SHARON gets up, decisively.)
We are gonna dance.
---
## ROBYN:
Oh come on.
---
## SHARON:
No
No
We are gonna dance.
You can't go to bed sad.
(She puts on a record. It might be Sydney
Bechet's "Si Tu Vois Ma Mere.")

 87
---
## ROBYN:
What is that.
---
## SHARON:
It's World War Two London.
The whole world has been bombed.
---
## ROBYN:
London?
---
## SHARON:
We're the only two people left, in the ruins of a
building
that has also been bombed but still, oddly, is standing.
You ' r e a pickpocket. And I'm a soldier.
Or maybe I'm a pickpocket and you're a sailor.
I don't know.
---
## ROBYN:
(But laughing.) You're crazy.
---
## SHARON:
We're sheltering. From the cold cold English wind.
And then suddenly
from somewhere far away
a lone apartment somewhere high off the street
we hear music.
It drifts.
It comes to us.
It catches us.
---
## ROBYN:
And then what?
(SHARON takes ROBYN's hand. They dance.)
(Old School World War II Bombed-Out
London Dance. It's playful and funny at
first, and then it's quieter, and then it's tender
and sweet and kind of shy, and then it heats
up. And then SHARON kisses ROBYN.)
(A beat. ROBYN pulls away. Wide-eyed.)
(A moment between them.)
---
## SHARON:
I'm sorry.
(Silence.)
I'm so sorry.
(Silence.)
Should I be sorry?
88 
---
## ROBYN:
I have to go to bed.
---
## SHARON:
Are you mad at me?
---
## ROBYN:
I have to go to bed.
(Beat)
I'm not mad at you.
---
## SHARON:
Robyn...
---
## ROBYN:
Good night.

o (Late morning. Sunlight slants in.)
(The kitchen, as they left it: a mess.)
(SHARON comes downstairs in her bathrobe,
groggy, a little hungover.)

(She puts the coffee on.)
o (Starts to clean up a little.)
o (She's waiting for Robyn.)
o (She goes to the stairs a few times, listens to
o see i f Robyn is awake yet.)
(She starts making a little extra noise to see if
Robyn will wake up.)

(Dropping things "accidentally.")
(And then she sees a note.)
(She picks it up.)
(Reads it.)

(Can't quite wrap her mind around it.)
(She opens the cabinets. Robyn's things are
gone. Out to the porch. Robyn's boxes are
gone. She rushes to look out onto the drive-
way. Robyn's car is gone. She comes back
inside.)
(A beat.)
(She sits down heavily at the kitchen table.)
(A beat.)
(She picks the note back up.)
(Reads it.)

(Crumples it.)
(She makes a phone call. It goes to voicemail.)

## SHARON:
Robyn, hi.
o This is Sharon.

Obviously.
I just woke up and I saw your things are all gone and
did we get robbed in the night? I just got worried
so
call me.
(Beat.)
Actually I got your note, so
(Beat.)
call me anyway.
(Beat.)
You didn't have to... [leave]
(Beat.)
I mean if it was - you know -
I was drunk and I barely remember what I was even
[doing]
and it's not like I'm even [gay]
but even if I was [gay]
it's not like I want to date you
so
you don't have to worry about that!
There's lots of other women I'd date
if I was going to date a woman
so...
(Beat, disentangling herself)
Call me.
Okay?
(She hangs up.)
(Beat.)
(She calls Robyn again. Voicemail.)
Hi Robyn it's me again
clearly
you probably aren't checking your phone

 91


and you're probably going to check it sometime soon
sometime later
but soon
and then you'll see I've been trying to reach you
and I'm sorry if I'm being alarmist
but
it's pretty
empty.
The house.

Is empty.
And I just.
I think you should call me?
So.
(This is raw.)
I miss you.

(Attempting to recover.)
Okay.
Bye.
(She hangs up.)
(She calls Robyn again. Voicemail.)
If you're going to leave because I kissed you?
That's bullshit.
And if you're leaving for some other reason?
That's also bullshit.
I am a grown-ass adult.
Okay.
If you just don't want to be responsible for me,
then don't worry!
You ' r e not responsible!
I absolve you!
And if you don't want to do the things we were doing
the phone calls and the book-club weed-ring and
whatever
92 
that's fine!
Don't do it!
I won't do it!
I don't care, I'm done anyway.
Or if I did it, I'd do it without you!
And where are you going to go, anyway?
Nobody wants you.
Amanda doesn't want you!
So come back!
(She hangs up.)
(She finds a small box under things.)
(Robyn's ceramic dolls.)
(She takes one out.)
(Emotion surges in her.)
(She smashes the doll.)
(That felt good. Another one. Another one.)
(Then freezes.)
(Inside the third doll is a small plastic bag.)
(The ceramic doll was stuffed with coke.)
(Another one of Robyn's businesses.)
(She smashes more dolls. More bags of coke.)
(Coke and doll shards everywhere,)
(Sharon is frozen in this moment of discov-
ery.)

(The kitchen.)
(Morning.)
(A week later.)
(SHARON sleeps in her kitchen. Filth has
accumulated. Dishes are unwashed, maybe
take-out cartons litter the floor, clothes
strewn. The WWII London record has been
playing on loop, but now the record spins
and the needle scratches.)
(The phone rings. SHARON jolts awake. She
looks terrible. Not entirely sober. It goes to the
answering machine. Sharon's recorded voice
on the machine is perky and bright.)
ANSWERING MACHINE. (Recording.) Hili, you've reached
Sharon, I'm so sorry I can't come to the phone right
now but leave me a message at the beep! Have a
great day!
SHARON'S SON. (Recording.) Mom. Hey. It's me.
You home?
(SHARON makes no move to answer it.)
Haven't heard from you in a while.
I mean that's cool, you must be
Doing Things so
that's awesome!
But
Your roommate called me.
(Will she pick up? But.. .no. He can't help her
right now.)
She said she had to leave for business
and she wanted me to check in on you
and I realized, we hadn't talked in a bit
like a little bit
94 
and uh
you left me some messages?
That, frankly, were kind of
crazy messages?
so I thought...
I'd call you
but
I guess I'll try you later.
Bye Mom.
(He hangs up.)
(A beat.)
(And then, the phone rings.)
(This time, she answers it.)
---
## SHARON:
...Hello...?
(And we see ---
## ROBYN:
Perhaps by the side of a
highway. Perhaps somewhere shadowy and
too far to reach. Either way, her voice fills the
entire space, soft and close.)
---
## ROBYN:
Hello. This is Victoria Jones from the Franco-
Global Society of International Orphans. Is this
Sharon?
(A beat.)
---
## SHARON:
This is Sharon.
---
## ROBYN:
Hi Sharon.
I'm calling you because we want to thank you.O
For your hard work.
Your. . .donations. Your.. .support.
---
## SHARON:
My...?
---
## ROBYN:
We recognize that it is hard to...care for strangers.
People who maybe
their lives have taken place on the other side of the
world from you
and their lives will continue to take place on the other
side of the world

 95
and someone with a less...developed...heart
might think: what does that have to do with me?
But you cared. You are a caring person.
And the Franco-Global Society of International
Orphans just wants to thank you for that.
(A beat.)
---
## SHARON:
Are you coming back?
---
## ROBYN:
Orphans, once they have left their homes for new
placements
rarely return.
---
## SHARON:
Victoria Jones.
---
## ROBYN:
Yes?
---
## SHARON:
Why is that.
---
## ROBYN:
Because sometimes their pasts are
contentious
and they recognize that they could cause great harm
to those they have come to care for
by returning.
---
## SHARON:
Or maybe sometimes they forget and move on
and don't care anymore.
---
## ROBYN:
No. That's not it.
I've done this job for a hundred years.
And that's not it.
---
## SHARON:
Are you with Amanda?
(A beat.)
---
## ROBYN:
I have to go now, Sharon, but
on behalf of all of us here at FGSIO
please take care of yourself.
---
## SHARON:
Wait!
---
## ROBYN:
What is it?
---
## SHARON:
Will I ever hear from you again?
(A beat.)
---
## ROBYN:
We might occasionally make a courtesy call,
96 
to check in on some of our most helpful donors.
(A beat.)
---
## SHARON:
Bye Victoria Jones.
---
## ROBYN:
Goodbye.
(She hangs up. A beat.)
(SHARON looks around her kitchen.
(She starts to wake up in a new way.)
(This is a prayer. Or a poem. It is raw and
fragile and new.)
---
## SHARON:
I'm standing in my kitchen.
I am standing in my kitchen and
my roommate told me that
people find words for themselves but
those words are not always right and
I think I don't have the right words, anymore.
Sharon doesn't feel [right].
Wife is no longer [right]
and for some time now, Mother has not been
right.
(Pause.)
"Roommate" was good.
That was a good word.COCC
But now it's no longer
right.
(Beat - a burst of anger.)
I just think
that there is a better way to do things
than the one where we live a certain life
and then we lose it completely!

(Pause.)
I slept in the kitchen for a week.
And now I'm awake.
And this house is very empty
And I don't know where to start.
Except over. Again.
(She gathers up the doll shards and coke bag-
gies. We might think she's going to throw
them out.
(And then...)
(She sets the bags of coke on the table in a
long row.)
All first poems are bad poems...
but there's a great liberty in being bad.
(As she considers her loot, and a glorious
future of illegal activity...)
(Blackout.)
