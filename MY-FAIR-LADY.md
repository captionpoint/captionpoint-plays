## ELIZA:
Aaaooowww!

---

## FREDDY:
I'm frightfully sorry.

---

## ELIZA:
Two bunches of violets trod in the mud. A full day's wages. Why don't you look where you're going?

---

## MRS. EYNSFORD-HILL:
Will you get a taxi, Freddy? Do you want me to catch pneumonia?

---

## FREDDY:
I'm sorry, mother. I'll get a taxi right away.
Sorry.

---

## ELIZA:
Oh, he's your son, is he? Well, if you'd done your duty by him as a mother should,
you wouldn't let him spoil a poor girl's flowers and then run away without paying.

---

## MRS. EYNSFORD-HILL:
Go on about your business, my girl.

---

## ELIZA:
Two bundles of violets trod in the mud.

---

## PICKERING:
Taxi! Taxi!

---

## ELIZA:
I say, Captain, buy a flower off a poor girl.

---

## PICKERING:
I'm sorry. I haven't any change.

---

## ELIZA:
I can change half a crown. Here, take this for tuppence.

---

## PICKERING:
I really haven't any - stop.here's three hapence, if that's any use to you.

---

## ELIZA:
Thank you, sir.

---

## BYSTANDER:
Here, you be careful… Better give him a flower fer it.
There's a bloke there behind the pillar taking down every blessed word you're saying.

---

## ELIZA:
I ain't done nothin' wrong by speakin' to the gentleman. I've a right to sell flowers if I keep off the kerb.
I'm a respectable girl; so help me, I never spoke to him except to ask him to buy a flower off me.

---

## ANOTHER BYSTANDER:
What's the row?

---

## HOXTON MAN:
What's all the bloomin' noise?

---

## SELSEY MAN:
There's a copper takin' her down.

---

## ELIZA:
Oh, sir, don't let him charge me. You dunno what it means to me.
They'll take away my character and drive me on the streets for speakin' to gentlemen.

---

## HIGGINS:
There! There! There! Who's hurting you, you silly girl! What do you take me for?

---

## ELIZA:
On my Bible oath, I never said a word…

---

## HIGGINS:
Oh, shut up, shut up. Do I look like a policeman?

---

## ELIZA:
Then what did you take down my words for? How do I know whether you took me down right?
You just show me what you wrote about me.
What's that? That ain't proper writing. I can't read that.

---

## HIGGINS:
I can. I say, Captain, buy a flower off a poor girl.

---

## ELIZA:
It's because I called him Captain. I meant no harm.
Oh, sir, don't let him lay a charge agen me for a word like that. You…

---

## PICKERING:
Charge! I make no charge.
Really, sir, if you are a detective, you need not begin protecting me against molestation by young women until I ask you.
Anybody could see the girl meant no harm.

---

## SELSEY MAN:
He ain't a copper. He's a gentleman. Look at his boots.

---

## HIGGINS:
And how are all your people down at Selsey?

---

## SELSEY MAN:
Who told you my people come from Selsey?

---

## HIGGINS:
Never mind. They do. How do you come to be up so far east? You were born in Lisson Grove.

---

## ELIZA:
Oooooh, what harm is there in my leaving Lisson Grove?
It wasn't fit for a pig to live in; and I had to pay four-and-six a week. Oh, boo-hoo-oo

---

## HIGGINS:
Live where you like; but stop that noise.

---

## HOXTON WOMAN:
Do you know where I come from?

---

## HIGGINS:
Hoxton.

---

## HOXTON WOMAN:
Well, who said I didn't. Blimey, you know everything, you do.

---

## ANOTHER BYSTANDER:
Tell him where he comes from, if you want to go fortune telling.

---

## HIGGINS:
Cheltenham, Harrow, Cambridge and India.

---

## PICKERING:
Quite right.

---

## BYSTANDER:
Blimey, he ain't a copper; he's a bloomin' busybody, that's what he is.

---

## PICKERING:
May I ask, sir, do you do this sort of thing for a living on the music halls?

---

## HIGGINS:
I have thought of that. Perhaps I will someday.

---

## ELIZA:
He's no gentleman, he ain't, to interfere with a poor girl.

---

## PICKERING:
How do you do it, if I may ask?

---

## HIGGINS:
Simple phonetics. The science of speech. That's my profession.also my hobby.
Anyone can spot an Irishman or a Yorkshireman by his brogue. I can place a man within six miles; I can place him within two miles in London.

---

Sometimes, as is the case with this girl, within two streets.

---

## ELIZA:
Ought to be ashamed of himself… Let him mind his own business and leave a poor girl -

---

## HIGGINS:
Woman! Cease this detestable boohooing instantly; or else seek the shelter of some other place of worship.

---

## ELIZA:
I've a right to be here if I like, same as you.

---

## HIGGINS:
A woman who utters such depressing and disgusting sounds has no right to be anywhere - no right to live.
Remember that you are a human being with a soul and the divine gift of articulate speech;

---

that your native language is the language of Shakespeare and Milton and the Bible; and don't sit there crooning like a bilious pigeon.

---

## ELIZA:
Aooooooooow!

## HIGGINS:
LOOK AT HER, A PRIS’NER OF THE GUTTERS;

CONDEMNED BY EV’RY SYLLABLE SHE UTTERS.

BY RIGHTS SHE SHOULD BE TAKEN OUT AND HUNG.

FOR THE COLD-BLOODED MURDER OF THE ENGLISH TONGUE!

## ELIZA:
A-o-o-o-w!

Aoooow!

## HIGGINS:
IT’S “AOOOW” AND “GARN” THAT KEEP HER IN HER PLACE,

## HIGGINS:
AN ENGLISHMAN’S WAY OF SPEAKING ABSOLUTELY CLASSIFIES HIM.

THE MOMENT HE TALKS HE MAKES SOME OTHER ENGLISHMAN DESPISE HIM.

ONE COMMON LANGUAGE I’M AFRAID WE’LL NEVER GET.

OH, WHY CAN’T THE ENGLISH LEARN TO

SET A GOOD EXAMPLE TO PEOPLE WHOSE ENGLISH IS PAINFUL TO YOUR EARS?

WHY CAN’T THE ENGLISH TEACH THEIR CHILDREN HOW TO SPEAK?

NORWEGIANS LEARN NORWEGIAN; THE GREEKS ARE TAUGHT THEIR GREEK.

IN FRANCE EV’RY FRENCHMAN KNOWS HIS LANGUAGE FROM “A” TO “ZED”

The French never care what they do, actually, as long as they pronounce it properly.

## HIGGINS:
ARABIANS LEARN ARABIAN WITH THE SPEED OF SUMMER LIGHTNING;

THE HEBREWS LEARN IT BACKWARDS, WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY FRIGHT’NING.

BUT USE PROPER ENGLISH, YOU’RE REGARDED AS A FREAK.

WHY CAN’T THE ENGLISH…

class: song
WHY CAN’T THE ENGLISH LEARN TO SPEAK?

---

## HIGGINS:
You see this creature with her curb-stone English; the English that will keep her in the gutter to the end of her days? Well, sir, in six months I could pass her off as a duchess at an Embassy Ball. I could even get her a place as a lady’s maid or shop assistant, which requires better English.

---

## ELIZA:
Here, what’s that you say?

---

## HIGGINS:
Yes, you squashed cabbage leaf, you disgrace to the noble architecture of these columns, you incarnate insult to the English language; I could pass you off as the Queen of Sheba.

---

## ELIZA:
Aooow! You don’t believe that, Captain?

---

## PICKERING:
Oh, well, anything is possible. I myself am a student of Indian dialects.

---

## HIGGINS:
Are you? Do you know Colonel Pickering, the author of “Spoken Sanskrit?”

---

## PICKERING:
I am Colonel Pickering. Who are you.

---

## HIGGINS:
Henry Higgins, author of “Higgins’ Universal Alphabet”.

---

## PICKERING:
I came from India to meet you!

---

## HIGGINS:
I was going to India to meet you!

---

## PICKERING:
Higgins!

---

## HIGGINS:
Pickering!
Where are you staying?

---

## PICKERING:
At the Carleton.

---

## HIGGINS:
No, you’re not. You’re staying at 27-A Wimpole Street. Come with me and we’ll have a jaw over supper.

---

## PICKERING:
Right you are.

---

## ELIZA:
Buy a flower, kind sir. I’m short for me lodging.

---

## HIGGINS:
Liar!
You said you could change half a crown.

---

## ELIZA:
You ought to be stuffed with nails, you ought. Here!
Take the whole bloomin’ basket for sixpence!

---

## HIGGINS:
Ah. The church. A reminder.
Indian dialects have always fascinated me. I have records of over fifty.

---

## PICKERING:
Have you, now. Did you know there are over two hundred?

---

## HIGGINS:
By George, it’s worse than London. Do you know them all?

Aooow! Aoooow! Aooooow!
Aooooooooow!

I ain’t runnin’ no charity bazaar. Drinks is to be paid for or not drunk. Come on, Doolittle. Out you go. Hop it now, Doolittle. On the double. On the double.

## DOOLITTLE:
Thanks for your hospitality, George. Send the bill to Buckingham Palace.

---

## JAMIE:
Well, Alfie, I guess it’s home we go.

---

## DOOLITTLE:
Home? What do you want to go home for? Eliza should be along in a few minutes. She ought to be good for half a crown for her father what loves her.

---

## HARRY:
Loves her? That’s a laugh. You ain’t been near her for months.

---

## DOOLITTLE:
What’s that got to do with it? What’s half a crown after all I’ve give her?

---

## JAMIE:
When did you ever give her anything?

---

## DOOLITTLE:
Anything? I gave her everything. I give her the greatest gift any human being can give to another.Life! I introduced her to this here planet, I did, with all its wonders and marvels. This lovely world with the sun that shines, and the moon that glows; Hyde Park to walk through on a fine Spring night. The whole ruddy city of London to roam about in sellin’ her bloomin’ flowers. I give her all that, and then I disappears and leaves her on her own to enjoy it.

---

Now if that ain’t worth half a crown now and again, I’ll take off my belt and give her what for.

---

## JAMIE:
You got a good heart, Alfie, but if you want that half a crown from Eliza, you better have a good story to go with it.

---

## DOOLITTLE:
Eliza! What a surprise!

---

## ELIZA:
Not a brass farthing.

---

## DOOLITTLE:
Now you look here, Eliza. You wouldn’t have the heart to send me home to your stepmother without a bit of liquid protection, now would you?

---

## ELIZA:
Stepmother. Ha! Stepmother, indeed!

---

## DOOLITTLE:
Well, I’m willing to marry her. It’s me that suffers by it. I’m a slave to that woman, Eliza. Just because I ain’t her lawful husband. Come on, Eliza, slip your old Dad half a crown to go home on.

---

## ELIZA:
Well, I had a bit of luck myself tonight. So here.

## ELIZA:
But don’t keep comin’ around coutin’ on half crowns from me!

Goodnight, Eliza! You’re a noble daughter!

[Voice recording of droning vowel sounds]

---

## PICKERING:
I say, Higgins, it’s a fearful strain listening to all these vowel sounds. I’m quite done up for this afternoon. Couldn’t we turn on the lights?

---

## HIGGINS:
Nonsense, you hear much better in the dark.

---

## MRS. PEARCE:
Mr. Higgins, are you there?

---

## HIGGINS:
What is it, Mrs. Pearce?

---

## MRS. PEARCE:
A young woman wants to see you, sir?

---

## HIGGINS:
A young woman!
What does she want?
Has she an interesting accent?

---

## MRS. PEARCE:
Oh, something dreadful, sir.

---

## HIGGINS:
Let’s have her up. Show her up, Mrs. Pearce.

---

## MRS. PEARCE:
Very well, sir. It’s for you to say.

---

## HIGGINS:
This is rather a bit of luck. I’ll show you how I make records. We’ll set her talking; and I’ll take her down in Bell’s Visible Speech; then in Broad Romic; and then we’ll get her on the phonograph so that you can turn her on as often as you like with the written transcript before you.

---

## MRS. PEARCE:
This is the young woman, sir.

---

## ELIZA:
Aooow.

---

## HIGGINS:
Oh, no!... this is the girl I jotted down last night. She’s no use.I’ve got all the records I want of the Lisson Grove lingo; and I’m not going to waste another cylinder on it. Be off with you; I don’t want you!

---

## ELIZA:
Don’t you be so saucy. You ain’t heard what I come for yet.
Did you tell him I come in a taxi?

---

## MRS. PEARCE:
Nonsense, girl! What do you think a gentleman like Mr. Giggins cares what you came in?

---

## ELIZA:
Oh, we are proud! He ain’t above given’ lessons, not him; I heard him say so. Well, I ain’t come here to ask for any compliment, and if my money’s not good enough I can go elsewhere.

---

## HIGGINS:
Good enough for what?

---

## ELIZA:
Good enough for you. Now you know, don’t ya? I’ve come to have lessons, I have. And to pay for them too, make no mistake.

---

## HIGGINS:
Well!!! What do you expect me to say?

---

## ELIZA:
If you was a gentleman, you might ask me to sit down, I think. Don’t I tell you I’m bringing you business?

---

## HIGGINS:
Pickering.shall we ask this baggage to sit down, or shall we throw her out of the window.

---

## ELIZA:
Aoooow! I won’t be called a baggage when I’ve offered to pay like any lady.

---

## PICKERING:
But what is it you want?

---

## ELIZA:
I want to be a lady in a flower shop instead of sellin’ flowers at the corner of Tottenham Court Road. But then won’t take me unless I can talk more genteel. He said he could teach me. Well, here I am ready to pay - not askin’ any favor - and he treats me as if I was dirt. I know what lessons cost, and I’m ready to pay.

---

## HIGGINS:
How much?

---

## ELIZA:
Now you’re talkin’! I thought you’d come off it when you saw a chance of getting back a bit of what you chucked at me last night. You’d had a drop in, hadn’t ya?

---

## HIGGINS:
Sit down.

---

## ELIZA:
Oh, if you’re going to make a compliment of it…

---

## HIGGINS:
Sit down.

---

## PICKERING:
What is your name?

---

## ELIZA:
Eliza Doolittle.

---

## PICKERING:
Won’t you sit down, Miss Doolittle?

---

## ELIZA:
Oh, I don’t mind if I do.

---

## HIGGINS:
How much do you propose to pay me for the lessons?

---

## ELIZA:
Oh, I know what’s right. A lady friend of mine gets French lessons for heighteenpence an hour from a real French gentleman. Well, you wouldn’t have the face to ask me the same for teaching me my own language as you would for French; so I won’t give more than a shilling. Take it or leave it.

---

## HIGGINS:
You know, Pickering, if you consider a shilling, not as a simple shilling, but as a percentage of this girl’s income, it works out as fully equivalent to sixty or seventy pounds from a millionaire. By George, it’s the biggest offer I ever had.

---

## ELIZA:
Sixty pounds! What are you talkin’ about? I never offered you sixty pounds! Where would I get…

---

## HIGGINS:
Oh, hold your tongue.

---

## ELIZA:
But I ain’t got sixty pounds. Oh…

---

## MRS. PEARCE:
Don’t cry, you silly girl. Sit down. Nobody is going to touch your money.

---

## HIGGINS:
Somebody is going to touch you with a broomstick, if you don’t stop snivelling. Now, sit down.

---

## ELIZA:
Aoooow! One would think you was my father!

---

## HIGGINS:
If I decide to teach you, I’ll be worse than two fathers to you. Here -

---

## ELIZA:
What’s this for?

---

## HIGGINS:
To wipe your eyes. To wipe any part of your face that feels moist. Remember.That’s your handkerchief; and that’s your sleeve. Don’t mistake the one for the other if you wish to become a lady in a shop.

---

## PICKERING:
Higgins, I’m interested. What about your boast that you could pass her off as a duchess at the Embassy Ball? I’ll say you’re the greatest teacher alive if you can make that good. I’ll bet you all the expenses of the experiment you can’t do it. And I’ll even pay for the lessons.

---

## ELIZA:
Oh, you’re real good. Thank you, Captain.

---

## HIGGINS:
It’s almost irresistible. She’s so deliciously low – so horribly dirty!

---

## ELIZA:
Aoooow! I ain’t dirty.I washed my face and hands afore I come, I did.

---

## HIGGINS:
I’ll take it! I’ll make a duchess of this draggle-tailed guttersnipe!

---

## ELIZA:
Aooooow!

---

## HIGGINS:
I’ll start today; now! This moment!
Take her away, and clean her, Mrs. Pearce. Sandpaper if it won’t come off any other way. Is there a good fire in the kitchen?

---

## MRS. PEARCE:
Yes.but –

---

## HIGGINS:
Take all her clothes off and burn them. Ring up and order some new ones. Wrap her up in brown paper ‘till they come.

---

## ELIZA:
You’re no gentleman, you’re not, to talk of such things.

---

## HIGGINS:
We want none of your slum prudery here, young woman. You’ve got to learn to behave like a duchess. Take her away, Mrs. Pearce.
If she gives you any trouble, wallop her.

---

## ELIZA:
I’ll call the police, I will!

---

## MRS. PEARCE:
But I’ve no place to put her.

---

## HIGGINS:
Put her in the dustbin.

---

## ELIZA:
Aoooow!

---

## PICKERING:
Oh come, Higgins! Be reasonable.

---

## MRS. PEARCE:
You must be reasonable, Mr. Higgins, really you must. You can’t walk over everybody like this.

---

## HIGGINS:
I walk over everybody? My dear Mrs. Pearce, my dear Pickering. I never had the slightest intention of walking over anybody. All I propose is that we should be kind to this poor girl. If I did not express myself clearly it was because I did not wish to hurt her delicacy, or yours.

---

## MRS. PEARCE:
But, sir, you can’t take a girl up like that as if you were picking up a pebble on the beach.

---

## HIGGINS:
Why not?

---

## MRS. PEARCE:
Why not? She may be married.

---

## ELIZA:
Garn!

## HIGGINS:
There! As the girl very properly says.Garn!

---

## ELIZA:
Who’d marry me?

---

## HIGGINS:
By George, Eliza, the streets will be strewn with the bodies of men shooting themselves for your sake before I’ve done with you.

---

## ELIZA:
Here! I’m goin’ away! He’s off his chump, he is.
I don’t want no balmies teachin’ me.

---

## HIGGINS:
Oh, indeed! I’m mad, am I? Very well, Mrs. Pearce, you needn’t order the new clothes for her.
Throw her out!

---

## MRS. PEARCE:
Stop, Mr. Higgins! I won’t allow it. Go home to your parents, girl.

---

## ELIZA:
I ain’t got no parents.

---

## HIGGINS:
There you are. “She ain’t got no parents.” What’s all the fuss about? The girl doesn’t belong to anybody, and she’s no use to anybody but me.

---

## PICKERING:
Does it occur to you, Higgins, that the girl has some feelings?

---

## HIGGINS:
Oh, no, I don’t think so. Oh, no! No! Not any feelings that we need bother about. Have you , Eliza?

---

## MRS. PEARCE:
Mr. Higgins. I must know on what terms the girl is to be here. What is to become of her when you’ve finished your teaching? You must look ahead a little, sir.

---

## HIGGINS:
What’s to become of her if I leave her in the gutter? Answer me that, Mrs. Pearce?

---

## MRS. PEARCE:
That’s her own business, not yours, Mr. Higgins.

---

## HIGGINS:
Well, when I’ve done with her, we can throw her back into the gutter, and then it will be her own business again; so that’s all right.

---

## ELIZA:
Oh, you’ve no feelin’ heart in you.you don’t care for nothing but yourself. Here! I’ve had enough of this. I’m going.

---

## HIGGINS:
Eliza!
Have some chocolates.

---

## ELIZA:
How do I know what might be in them? I’ve heard of girls being drugged by the like of you.

---

## HIGGINS:
Pledge of good faith, Eliza. I eat one half… you eat the other.
You shall have boxes of them, barrels of them, every day. You shall live on them, eh?

---

## ELIZA:
I wouldn’t have ate it, only I’m too ladylike to take it out of me mouth.

---

## PICKERING:
Excuse me, Higgins…! But I really must interfere! Mrs. Pearce is quite right. If this girl is to put herself in your hands for six months for an experiment in teaching, she must understand thoroughly what she’s doing!

---

## HIGGINS:
Eliza; you are to stay here for the next six months learning how to speak beautifully, like a lady in a florist’s shop. If you’re good and do whatever you’re told, you shall sleep in a proper bedroom and have lots to eat, and money to buy chocolates and take rides in taxis. If you’re naughty and idle and will sleep in the back kitchen among the black beetles, and be walloped by Mrs. Pearce with a broomstick. At the end of six months you shall go to Buckingham Palace in a carriage, beautifully dressed. If the King finds out you’re not a lady, you will be taken by the Police to the Tower of London where your head will be cut off as a warning to other presumptuous flower girls. If you are not found out, you shall have a present of seven-and-six to start life with as a lady in a shop. If you refuse this offer you will be the most ungrateful, wicked girl,; and the angels will weep for you.

---

Now are you satisfied, Pickering?
Could I pout it more plainly or fairly, Mrs. Pearce?

---

## MRS. PEARCE:
Come with me, Eliza.

---

## HIGGINS:
Thank you, Mrs. Pearce. Bundle her off to the bathroom.

---

## ELIZA:
You’re a great bully, you are. I won’t stay here if I don’t like. And I won’t let nobody wallop me.

---

## MRS. PEARCE:
Don’t answer back, girl.

---

## ELIZA:
If I’d known what I was lettin’ myself in for, I wouldn’t have come up here. I’ve always been a good girl and I won’t be put upon…

---

## HIGGINS:
In six months – in three if she has a good ear and a quick tongue – I’ll take her anywhere and pass her off as anything. I’ll make a Queen of that barbarous wretch.

---

## PICKERING:
Higgins, forgive the bluntness, but if I’m to be in this business, I shall feel responsible for the girl. I hope it’s clearly understood that no advantage is to be taken of her position.

---

## HIGGINS:
What? That thing? Sacred, I assure you.

---

## PICKERING:
Now come, Higgins, you know what I mean! This is not trifling matter! Are you a man of good character where women are concerned?

---

## HIGGINS:
Have you ever met a man of good character where women are concerned?

---

## PICKERING:
Yes. Very frequently.

---

## HIGGINS:
Well, I haven’t. I find that the moment I let a woman make friends with me she becomes jealous, exacting, suspicious and a damned nuisance. I find that the moment I let myself become friends with a woman, I become selfish and tyrannical.

---

So here I am, a confirmed old bachelor, and likely to remain so. After all, Pickering:
I’m an ordinary man,

## MRS. PEARCE:
Mr. Higgins, you simply cannot go on working the girl this way. Making her say her alphabet over and over, from sunup to sundown, even during meals – when will it stop?

---

## HIGGINS:
When she does it properly, of course. Is that all, Mrs. Pearce?

---

## MRS. PEARCE:
No sir. The mail.

---

## HIGGINS:
Well, pay the bills and say no to the invitations. Is that all?

---

## MRS. PEARCE:
No, sir. There’s another letter from that American millionaire, Ezra D. Wallingford. He still wants you to lecture for his Moral Reform League.

---

## HIGGINS:
Throw it in the dustbin.

---

## MRS. PEARCE:
It’s the third letter he’s written you, sir. You should at least answer it.

---

## HIGGINS:
Oh, all right. Leave it on the desk. I’ll get to it.

---

## BUTLER:
If you please, sir, there’s a dustman downstairs. He says you have his daughter here.

---

## PICKERING:
Phew! I say!

## HIGGINS:
Send the blackguard up.

---

## PICKERING:
He may not be a blackguard, Higgins.

---

## HIGGINS:
Nonsense. Of course he’s a blackguard.
But we might get something interesting out of him.

---

## PICKERING:
About the girl.

---

## HIGGINS:
No no, I mean his dialect.

---

## BUTLER:
Doolittle, sir.

---

## DOOLITTLE:
Professor ‘iggins?

---

## HIGGINS:
Good morning.

---

## DOOLITTLE:
Where?!

---

## HIGGINS:
Here.
Morning, Governor.
I come about a very serious matter, Governor.

---

## HIGGINS:
Born in a Houndslow, Mother Welsh!
What do you want, Doolittle?

---

## DOOLITTLE:
I want my daughter. That’s what I want. See?

---

## HIGGINS:
Of course you do. You’re her father, aren’t you? I’m glad to see you have some spark of family feeling left. She’s upstairs, here. Take her away at once.

---

## DOOLITTLE:
What??!!

---

## HIGGINS:
Take her away. Do you suppose I’m going to keep your daughter for you?

---

## DOOLITTLE:
Now, now, look here, Governor. Is this reasonable? Is it fairity to take advantage of a man like this? The girl belongs to me. You got her. Where do I come in?

---

## HIGGINS:
How dare you come here and attempt to blackmail me? You sent her here on purpose.

---

## DOOLITTLE:
Now don’t take a man up like that, Governor.

---

## HIGGINS:
The Police shall take you up. This is a plant – a plot to extort money by threats. I shall telephone the Police.

---

## DOOLITTLE:
Have I asked you for a brass farthing? I leave it to this gentleman here.Have I said a word about money?

---

## HIGGINS:
What else did you come for?

---

## DOOLITTLE:
I’ll tell ya, Governor, if you’ll only let me get a word in. I’m willing to tell ya. I’m wanting to tell ya. I’m waiting to tell ya.

---

## HIGGINS:
Pickering, this chap has a certain natural girl of rhetoric. Observe the rhythm of his native woodnotes wild.“I’m willing to tell you; I’m wanting to tell you I’m waiting to tell you,” That’s the Welsh strain in him.

---

How did you know Eliza was here if you didn’t send her?

---

## DOOLITTLE:
She sent back for her luggage, and I got to hear about it. She said she didn’t want no clothes. What was I to think form that, Governor? I ask you as a parient, what was I to think?

---

## HIGGINS:
So you came to rescue her from worse than death, eh?

---

## DOOLITTLE:
Just so, Governor. That’s right.

---

## HIGGINS:
Mrs. Pearce, Eliza’s father has come to take her away. Give her to him.

---

## DOOLITTLE:
Now wait a minute, Governor, wait a minute. You and me is men of the world ain’t we?

---

## HIGGINS:
Oh! Men of the world, are we?
You’d better go, Mrs. Pearce.

---

## MRS. PEARCE:
I think so indeed, sir!

---

## DOOLITTLE:
Governor, I’ve taken a sort of fancy to you.
And if you want the girl I’m not to set on havin’ her back home again, but what I might be open to is an arrangement.

---

All I ask is my rights as a father; and you’re the last man alive to expect me to let her go for nothing; for I can see you’re the one of the straight sort, Governor.
Well, what’s a five-pound note to you? And what’s Eliza to me?

---

## PICKERING:
I think you ought to know, Doolittle, that Mr. Higgins’ intentions are entirely honorable.

---

## DOOLITTLE:
Of course they are, Governor. If I thought they wasn’t I’d ask fifty.

---

## HIGGINS:
Do you mean to say that you would sell your daughter for fifty pounds?

---

## PICKERING:
Have you no morals, man?

---

## DOOLITTLE:
No! I can’t afford ‘em, Governor. Neither could you if you was as poor as me. Not that I mean any harm, mind ya… but…
If Eliza is going to get a bit out of this, why not me, too?

---

Eh? Look at it my way. What am I? I ask ya, what am I? I’m one of the undeserving poor, that’s what I am. Think what that means to a man.

---

It means he’s up agenst middle-class morality for all the time. If there’s anything going and I put in for a bit of it, it’s always the same story.You’re undeserving, so you can’t have it.

---

But my needs is as great as the most deserving widow’s that ever got money out of six different charities in one week for the death of the same husband.

---

I don’t need less than a deserving man, I need more. I don’t eat less hearty than he does, and I drink a lot more. I’m playing straight with you. I ain’t pretending to be deserving. I’m underserving, and I mean to go on being undeserving. I like it, and that’s the truth. But will you take advantage of a man’s nature to do him out of the price of his own daughter what he’s brought up, fed and clothed by the sweat of his brow, till she's growed big enough to be interesting to you two gentlemen? Is five pounds unreasonable? I put it  to you, and I leave it to you.

---

## HIGGINS:
You know, Pickering, if we were to take this man in hand for six months, he could choose between a seat in the Cabinet and a popular pulpit in Wales. I suppose we ought to give him a fiver?

---

## PICKERING:
He’ll make bad use of it, I’m afraid.

---

## DOOLITTLE:
Not me, so help me, Governor, I won’t. Just one good spree for myself and the missus, givin’ pleasure to ourselves and employment to others, and satisfaction to you to know it ain’t been throwed away. You couldn’t spend it better.

---

## HIGGINS:
This is irresistible.
Oh, damn!
Let’s give him ten.

---

## DOOLITTLE:
No! The missus wouldn’t have the heart to spend ten, Governor; ten pounds is a lot of money.it makes a man feel prudent-like; and then goodbye to happiness. No, you give me what I ask for, Governor.not a penny less, not a penny more.

---

## PICKERING:
I rather draw the line at encouraging this sort of immortality. Doolittle, why don’t you marry that missus of yours? After all, marriage is not so frightening. You married Eliza’s mother?

---

## DOOLITTLE:
Who told you that, Governor?

---

## HIGGINS:
Pickering, if we listen to this man another minute we shall have no convictions left. Five pounds, I think you said?

---

## DOOLITTLE:
Thank you, Governor.

---

## ELIZA:
I won’t! I won’t! I won’t!

---

## DOOLITTLE:
Beg pardon, Miss!

---

## ELIZA:
I won’t say those ruddy vowels one more time!

---

## DOOLITTLE:
Blimey, it’s Eliza! I never thought she’d clean up so good-lookin’. She does me credit, don’t she, Governor?

---

## ELIZA:
Here! What are you doin’ here?

---

## DOOLITTLE:
You hold your tongue and don’t you give these gentlemen none of your lip. If you have any trouble with her, Governor, give her a few licks of the strap. That’s the way to improve her mind.
Good mornin’, gentlemen.
Cheerio, Eliza.

---

## HIGGINS:
By George, there’s a man for you! A philosophical genius of the first water. Mrs. Pearce, write to Mrs. Ezra Wallingford and tell himi if he wants a lecturer to get in touch with Mr. Alfred P. Doolittle, a common dustman – but one of the most original moralists in England.

---

## MRS. PEARCE:
Yes, sir.

---

## ELIZA:
Here. What did he come for?

---

## HIGGINS:
Say your vowels.

---

## ELIZA:
I know my vowels. I knew them before I come.

---

If you know them, say them.

Ahyee, E, Iyee, Ow, You!

## HIGGINS:
Stop! Say.A, E, I, O, U!

I know it’s difficult, Miss Doolittle. But try to understand…

---

## HIGGINS:
No use explaining, Pickering. As a military man you ought to know that. Drilling is what she needs. Much better leave her or she’ll be turning to you for sympathy.

All right, if you insist, but have a little patience with her, Higgins.

Does the same thing hold true in India, Pickering? The peculiar habit of not only dropping a letter like the letter aitch, but using it where it shouldn’t be? Like “hever” instead of “ever”? You’ll notice some of the Slavic peoples when they learn to speak English have a tendency to -

I say, Higgins, perhaps the poem is too difficult for the girl. Why don’t you try a simpler one? Like.“The Owl and the Pussy-cat”? That’s a damned fine poem!

Are you feeling all right, Mr. Higgins?

Quite well, thank you, Mrs. Pearce. And you? Splendid.
Let’s test her in public and see how she fares. I know, let’s take her to the races.

The races!?

## HIGGINS:
Yes! My mother’s box at Ascot.

## PICKERING:
You’ll consult your mother first, of course.

Of course…
No! We’ll surprise her. Let’s go straight to bed. First thing in the morning we’ll go off and buy her a gown.
Eliza, go on with your work.

But Mr. Higgins. It’s early in the morning!

Whiteley’s, of course.

## PICKERING:
Common knowledge.

---

## HIGGINS:
Is it?
Well,  we mustn’t get her anything too flowery. I despise those gowns with a sort of weed here and a weed there. Something simple, modest and elegant is what’s called for. Perhaps with a sash.
Yes, just right.

## MRS. HIGGINS:
Colonel Pickering, I don’t understand – do you mean that my son is coming to Ascot today?

---

## PICKERING:
Yes, he is, Mrs. Higgins. As a matter of fact, he’s here!

---

## MRS. HIGGINS:
What a disagreeable surprise. Ascot is usually the one place I can come to with my friends and not run the risk of seeing my son, Henry. Whenever my friends meet him, I never see them again.

---

## PICKERING:
He had to come, Mrs. Higgins. You see, he’s taking the girl to the annual Embassy Ball, and he wanted to try her out first.

---

## MRS. HIGGINS:
I beg your pardon?

---

## PICKERING:
You know… the annual Embassy Ball…

---

## MRS. HIGGINS:
Yes, I know the Ball… but what girl?

---

## PICKERING:
Oh, didn’t I mention that?

---

## MRS. HIGGINS:
No, you did not.

---

## PICKERING:
Well, it’s quite simple, really. One night I went to the Opera at Covent Garden to hear one of my favorite operas – “Aïda” – and as I was coming out – incidentally, they didn’t do “Aïda” that night – No, they did “Götterdämmerung” instead. I’d never heard “Götterdämmerung”. By George, that’s a rackety one! Now, when this tenor chap…

---

## MRS. HIGGINS:
What about the girl, Colonel?

---

## PICKERING:
Oh, yes. As I was coming out, I met your son, Henry, who, in turn, met Miss Doolittle, who now lives with Henry.

---

## MRS. HIGGINS:
Lives with Henry? Is it a love affair?

---

## PICKERING:
Heavens, no! She’s a flower girl. He picked her up off the curb-stone.

---

## MRS. HIGGINS:
A flower girl?

---

## PICKERING:
Yes. Higgins said to me.“Pickering, you see this girl? In six months I could make a duchess of her.” I said.“Nonsense.” He came back with “Yes, I can.” “All right,” I said, “I’ll make a bet with you you can’t.” And I did. And he is.

---

## MRS. HIGGINS:
But Colonel – am I to understand that Henry is bringing a flower girl to Ascot?

---

## PICKERING:
Yes, Mrs. Higgins. That’s is, that’s it precisely! Jolly good, Mrs. Higgins! Jolly good!

Excuse me, Mrs. Higgins. I must fetch her.

---

## MRS. HIGGINS:
Henry, dear, I’m most provoked. I’ve heard you’ve brought a common flower girl from Covent Garden to my box.

---

## HIGGINS:
Oh, darling, she’ll be all right. I’ve taught her to speak properly, and she has strict orders as to her behavior. She’s to keep to two subjects – the weather and everybody’s health – sort of “fine day” and “how do you do” – and not just let herself go on things in general. Help her along, darling, and you’ll be quite safe.

---

## MRS. HIGGINS:
Safe? To talk about our health in the middle of a race?

---

## HIGGINS:
Well, she’s got to talk about something.

---

## MRS. HIGGINS:
Henry, you’re not even dressed for Ascot.

---

## HIGGINS:
I changed my shirt.

---

## MRS. HIGGINS:
Where is the girl now?

## HIGGINS:
Being pinned. Some of the clothes we bought for her didn’t quite fit. I told Pickering we should have taken her with us.

You’re a pretty pair of babies playing with your live doll.

Oh, damn, are all those people with you?

Mrs. Higgins, is this your celebrated son?

Ah!

Ah, Colonel Pickering, you’re just in time for tea.

Thank you. Mrs. Higgins, may I introduce Miss Eliza Doolittle?

Mrs. Eynsford-Hill. Miss Doolittle.

How do you do?

Miss Doolittle?

Good afternoon, Professor Higgins.

## FREDDY:
The first race was very exciting, Miss Doolittle. I’m so sorry you missed it.

---

## MRS. HIGGINS:
Will it rain do you think?

---

## ELIZA:
The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain.
But in Hartford, Heresford, Hampshire hurricanes hardly ever happen.

---

## FREDDY:
How awfully funny.

---

## ELIZA:
What is wrong with that, young man? I bet I got it right.

---

## FREDDY:
Smashing.

---

## MRS. EYNSFORD-HILL:
I do hope we won’t have any unseasonably cold spells. It brings on so much influenza, and our whole family is susceptible to it.

---

## ELIZA:
My aunt died of influenza, so they said.
But it’s my belief they done the old woman in.

---

## MRS. HIGGINS:
Done her in?

---

## ELIZA:
Yes, Lord love you! Why should she die of influenza when she come through diphtheria right enough the year before? Fairly blue with it she was. They all thought she was dead; but my father, he kept ladling gin down her throat.

---

Then she came to so sudden that she bit the bowl of the spoon.

---

## MRS. EYNSFORD-HILL:
Dear me!

---

## ELIZA:
Now, what call would a woman with that strength in her have to die of influenza, and what become of her new straw hat that should have come to me?
Somebody pinched it;
And what I say is, them as pinched it, done her in.

---

## LORD BOXINGTON:
Done her in? Done her in, did you say?

---

## HIGGINS:
Oh, that’s the new small talk. To do a person in means to kill them.

---

## MRS. EYNSFORD-HILL:
You surely don’t believe your aunt was killed?

---

## ELIZA:
Do I not! Them she lived with would have killed her for a hatpin, let alone a hat.

---

## MRS. EYNSFORD-HILL:
But it can’t have been right for your father to pour spirits down her throat like that. It might have killed her.

---

## ELIZA:
Not her. Gin was mother’s milk to her.
Besides, he’s poured so much down his own throat that he knew the good of it.

---

## LORD BOXINGTON:
Do you mean that he drank?

---

## ELIZA:
Drank! My word! Something chronic.
Here! What are you sniggering at!

---

## FREDDY:
The new small talk. You do it so awfully well.

---

## ELIZA:
If I was doing it proper, what was you laughing at?
Have I said anything I oughtn’t?

Well, that’s a mercy, anyhow.

Come, my dear.

Higgins, if there’s any mishap at the Embassy tonight, if Miss Doolittle suffers any embarrassment whatever, it’s on your head alone. I’ve been begging you to call off this experiment ever since Ascot.

Eliza can do anything.

You could always rejoin your regiment.

Higgins, this is no time for flippancy. The way you’ve driven her these last six weeks has exceeded all the bounds of common… Oh, for God’s sake, Higgins, stop pacing up and down! Can’t you settle someplace?

## HIGGINS:
Have some Port. It will quieten your nerves.

## PICKERING:
I’m not nervous! Where is it?

On the desk.

Thank you, Mrs. Pearce. Are you helping Eliza?

Yes, sir.

## PICKERING:
Help her, indeed! I’ll bet the damned gown doesn’t fit. I warned you about those French designers. You should have gone to a good English store, where you knew everybody was on our side.
Have a little Port.

---

## HIGGINS:
No, thank you.

---

## PICKERING:
It will quieten your nerves.

---

## HIGGINS:
No, thank you.

## PICKERING:
Are you so sure she’ll retain all you’ve hammered into her?

---

## HIGGINS:
We shall see.

---

## PICKERING:
But suppose she doesn’t?

---

## HIGGINS:
Then I lose my bet.

---

## PICKERING:
You know what I can’t stand about you, Higgins? It’s your confounded complacency. In a moment like this, with so much at stake, it’s utterly indecent that you don’t need a little Port. What of the girl? You act as if she doesn’t matter at all.

---

## HIGGINS:
Rubbish, Pickering. Of course she matters. What do you think I’ve been doing all these months? What could possibly matter more than to take a human being and change her into a different human being be creating a new speech for her? Why, it’s filling up the deepest gulf that separates class from class, and soul from soul. She matters immensely.

Miss Doolittle, you look beautiful.

I know. I’ve heard several people asking who she is. Do tell me what happened.

Higgins said.“Madame Ambassador, may I introduce Miss Eliza Doolittle?” and Madame Ambassador said.“How do you do? – and Eliza came right back with.“How do you do?”

---

## MRS. HIGGINS:
Is that all?

---

## PICKERING:
Oh, no! When it was my turn, both the Ambassador and his wife said to me.“Colonel Pickering, who is that captivating creature with Professor Higgins?”

---

## MRS. HIGGINS:
What did you say?

---

## PICKERING:
Well, I was stopped for a moment. Then I collected myself and I said.“Eliza Doolittle.”

---

## MRS. HIGGINS:
That was quick thinking, Colonel.

Thank you.
Mrs. Higgins, do you think Eliza will make it?

I have not your imposing appearance; your figure, your brow. Nobody notice me when I shave.

Decorations for language. The Queen of Transylvania is here this evening. I am indispensable to her at these international parties. I speak thirty-two languages. I know everybody in Europe. No imposter escape my detection. And now, Professor, you must introduce me to this glorious creature you escort this evening. She fascinate everyone.

TONIGHT, OLD MAN, YOU DID IT!

YOU DID IT! YOU DID IT!

YOU SAID THAT YOU WOULD DO IT,

AND INDEED YOU DID.

I THOUGHT THAT YOU WOULD RUE IT;

I DOUBTED YOU’D DO IT.

AND WHEN THE PRINCE OF TRANSYLVANIA

ASKED TO MEET HER,

AND GAVE HIS ARM TO LEAD HER TO THE FLOOR,

I SAID TO HIM.“YOU DID IT! YOU DID IT!

YOU DID IT!” THEY THOUGHT SHE WAS ECSTATIC

AND SO DAMN’D ARISTOCRATIC,

AND THEY NEVER KNEW THAT

YOU DID IT!

## HIGGINS:
Thank Heavens for Zoltan Karpathy. If it weren’t for him I would have died of boredom. He was there, all right. And up to his old tricks.

Karpathy? That dreadful Hungarian? Was he there?

Yes.

NEVER HAVE I EVER KNOWN

A RUDER PEST!

FIN’LLY I DECIDED IT WAS GOOLISH

NOT TO LET HIM HAVE HIS CHANCE WITH HER.

SO I STEPPED ASIDE AND LET HIM DANCE WITH HER.

OOZING CHARM FROM EV’RY PORE,

HE OILED HIS WAY AROUND THE FLOOR.

EV’RY TRICK THAT HE COULD PLAY,

class: song
HE USED TO STRIP HER MASK AWAY.

AND WHEN AT LAST THE DANCE WAS DONE,

HE GLOWED AS IF HE KNEW HE’D WON!

AND WITH A VOICE TOO EAGER,

HE ANNOUNCED TO THE HOSTESS

THAT SHE WAS A FRAUD!

## HIGGINS:
All I can say is, thank God it’s all over. Now I can go to bed at least without dreading tomorrow.

---

## MRS. PEARCE:
Good night.

---

## PICKERING:
I think I shall turn in, too. It’s been a great occasion. Goodnight, Higgins.

---

## HIGGINS:
Goodnight, Pickering. Oh, Mrs. Pearce…
Oh damn, I meant to tell her I wanted coffee in the morning instead of tea.
Leave a little note for her, Eliza, will you?
What the devil have I done with my slippers?

---

## ELIZA:
There are your slippers! And there! Take your slippers, and may you never have a day’s luck with them!

---

## HIGGINS:
What on earth? What’s the matter? Is anything wrong?

---

## ELIZA:
Nothing wrong – with you. I’ve won your bet for you, haven’t I? That’s enough for you. I don’t matter, I suppose?

---

## HIGGINS:
You won my bet! You! Presumptuous insect. I won it! What did you throw those slippers at me for?

---

## ELIZA:
Because I wanted to smash your face. I’d like to kill you, you selfish brute. Why didn’t you leave me where you picked me out of – in the gutter? You thank God it’s all over, and that now you can throw me back again there, do you?

---

## HIGGINS:
So the creature is nervous, after all?
Ah! Claws in, you cat! How dare you show your temper to me.
Sit down and be quiet.

---

## ELIZA:
What’s to become of me? What’s to become of me?

---

## HIGGINS:
How the devil do I know what’s to become of you? What does it matter what becomes of you?

---

## ELIZA:
You don’t care. I know you don’t care. You wouldn’t care if I was dead. I’m nothing to you – not so much as them slippers.

---

## HIGGINS:
“Those” slippers.

---

## ELIZA:
Those slippers. I didn’t think it made any difference now.

---

## HIGGINS:
Why have you suddenly begun going on like this? May I ask whether you complain of your treatment here?

---

## ELIZA:
No.

---

## HIGGINS:
Has anybody behaved badly to you? Colonel Pickering? Mrs. Pearce?

---

## ELIZA:
No.

---

## HIGGINS:
You don’t pretend that I have treated you badly?

---

## ELIZA:
No.

---

## HIGGINS:
Well, I’m glad to hear it.
Perhaps you’re tired after the strain of the day?
Have a chocolate?

---

## ELIZA:
No!... thank you.

---

## HIGGINS:
I suppose it was natural for you to be anxious, but it’s all over now. There’s nothing more to worry about.

---

## ELIZA:
No, nothing more for you to worry about. Oh God, I wish I was dead.

---

## HIGGINS:
Why, in Heaven’s name, why? Listen to me, Eliza. All this irritation is purely subjective.

---

## ELIZA:
I don’t understand. I’m too ignorant.

---

## HIGGINS:
It’s only imagination. Nobody’s hurting you. Nothing’s wrong. You go to bed like a good girl, and sleep it off. Have a little cry and say your prayers; that will make you comfortable.

---

## ELIZA:
I heard your prayers – “Thank God it’s all over!”

---

## HIGGINS:
Well, don’t you thank God it’s all over? Now you are free and can do what you like.

---

## ELIZA:
What am I fit for? What have you left me fit for? Where am I to go? What am I to do? What’s to become of me?

---

## HIGGINS:
Oh, that’s what’s worrying you, is it?

---

Oh, I shouldn’t bother about that if I were you. I should imagine you won’t have much difficulty in settling yourself somewhere or other – though I hadn’t quite realized you were going away. You might marry, you know.

---

You see, Eliza, all men are not confirmed old bachelors like me and the Colonel. Most men are the marrying sort, poor devils. And you’re not bad-looking. It’s quite a pleasure to look at you at times.

---

Not now, of course. You’ve been crying and look like the very devil; but when you’re all right and quite yourself, you’re what I should call attractive. Come, you go to bed and have a good night’s rest; and then get up and look at yourself in the glass; and you won’t feel so cheap.

---

I daresay my mother could find some chap or other who would do very well.

---

## ELIZA:
We were above that in Covent Garden.

---

## HIGGINS:
What do you mean?

---

## ELIZA:
I sold flowers. I didn’t sell myself. Now you’ve made a lady of me, I’m not fit to sell anything else.

---

## HIGGINS:
Oh tosh, Eliza, don’t insult human relations by dragging all that can’t about buying and selling into it. You needn’t marry the fellow if you don’t want to.

---

## ELIZA:
What else am I to do?

---

## HIGGINS:
Oh, lots of things. What about that old idea of a florist’s shop? Pickering could set you up in one. He’s got lots of money.

---

He’ll have to pay for all those togs you’ve been wearing; and that, with the hire of the jewelry, will make a big hole in two hundred pounds. Oh, come! You’ll be all right. I must clear off to bed; I’m devilish sleepy.

---

By the way, I was looking for something. What was it?

---

## ELIZA:
Your slippers.

---

## HIGGINS:
Yes, of course.
You shied them at me.

---

## ELIZA:
Before you go, sir –

---

## HIGGINS:
Eh?

---

## ELIZA:
Do my clothes belong to me or Colonel Pickering?

---

## HIGGINS:
What the devil use would they be to Pickering? Why need you start bothering about that in the middle of the night?

---

## ELIZA:
I want to know what I may take away with me. I don’t want to be accused of stealing.

---

## HIGGINS:
Stealing? You shouldn’t have said that, Eliza. That shows a want of feeling.

---

## ELIZA:
I’m sorry. I’m only a common, ignorant girl; and in my station, I have to be careful. There can’t be any feeling between the like of you and the like of me. Please will you tell me what belongs to me and what doesn’t?

---

## HIGGINS:
You may take the whole damned houseful if you like. Except the jewels. They’re hired. Will that satisfy you?

---

## ELIZA:
Stop, please!
Will you take these to your room and keep them safe? I don’t want to run the risk of their being missing.

---

## HIGGINS:
Oh, hand them over!
If these belonged to me instead of the jeweller, I’d ram them down your ungrateful throat.

---

## ELIZA:
This ring isn’t the jeweller’s; it’s the one you bought me in Brighton. I don’t want it now.
Don’t you hit me.

---

## HIGGINS:
Hit you! You infamous creature, how dare you accuse me of such a thing? It is you who have hit me. You have wounded me to the heart.

---

## ELIZA:
I’m glad. I’ve got a little of my own back, anyhow.

---

## HIGGINS:
You have caused me to lose my temper; a thing that has hardly ever happened to me before. I prefer to say nothing more tonight. I am going to bed.

---

## ELIZA:
You’d better leave your own note for Mrs. Pearce about the coffee, for it won’t be done by me!

---

## HIGGINS:
Damn Mrs. Pearce! And damn the coffee! And damn you!
And damn my own folly in having lavished my hard-earned knowledge and the treasure of my regard and intimacy on a heartless guttersnipe!

Thank you, George. Here, take the missus a trip to Brighton.

Thank you, Mr. Doolittle.

## ELIZA:
Father!

## DOOLITTLE:
You see, Harry, he has no mercy. Sent her down to spy on me in my misery, he did. Me own flesh and blood.
Well, I’m miserable, all right.
You can tell him that straight.

---

## ELIZA:
What are you talking about? What are you dressed up for?

---

## DOOLITTLE:
As if you didn’t know. Go on back to that Wimpole Street devil and tell him what he done to me.

---

## ELIZA:
What has he done to you?

---

## DOOLITTLE:
He’s ruined me, that’s all. Destroyed me happiness. Tied me up and delivered me into the hands of middle-class morality.. And don’t you defend him. Was it him or was it not him that wrote to an old American blighter named Wallingford that was giving five millions to found moral reform societies, and tell him the most original moralist in England was Mr. Alfred P. Doolittle, a common dustman?

---

## ELIZA:
That sounds like one of his jokes.

---

## DOOLITTLE:
You may call it a joke. It put the lid on me, right enough! The bloke died and left me four thousand pounds a year in his bloomin’ will.

---

## JAMIE:
Oh, come on, Alfie. In a couple of hours you have to be at the church.

---

## ELIZA:
Church?

---

## DOOLITTLE:
Yes, church. The deepest cut of all.
Why do you think I’m dressed up like a ruddy pall-bearer?
Your stepmother wants to marry me. Now I’m respectable – she wants to be respectable.

---

## ELIZA:
If that’s the way you feel, why don’t you give the money back?

---

## DOOLITTLE:
That’s the tragedy of it, Eliza. It’s easy to say chuck it, but I haven’t the nerve. We’re all intimidated. Intimidated, Eliza, that’s what we are. And that’s what I am. Bought up. That’s what your precious professor has brought me to.

---

## ELIZA:
Not my precious professor.

---

## DOOLITTLE:
Oh, sent you back, has he? First he shoves me in the middle-class, then he chucks you out for me to support you. All part of his plan.

---

But you double-cross him Eliza. Don’t you come home to me. Don’t you take tuppence from me. You stand on your own two feet.
You’re a lady now and you can do it.

---

## FREDDY:
Eliza, it’s getting awfully cold in that taxi.

---

## DOOLITTLE:
I say, you want to come and see me turned off this mornin’? St. George’s, Hanover Square, ten o’clock.
I wouldn’t advise it, but you’re welcome.

---

## ELIZA:
No, thank you, Dad.

Are you all finished here?

Yes, Freddy. I’m all finished here.
Good luck, Dad.

I don’t know where the girl went at all, Mr. Higgins.

## HIGGINS:
Pickering!
Didn’t she say where to send her clothes?

---

## MRS. PEARCE:
I told you, sir, she took them all with her.

---

## PICKERING:
What? What?

---

## HIGGINS:
Here’s a confounded thing. Eliza’s bolted!

---

## PICKERING:
Bolted?

---

## HIGGINS:
Yes, bolted! And Mrs. Pearce let her go without telling me a word about it.

---

## PICKERING:
Well, I’m dashed!

---

## HIGGINS:
What am I to do? I got tea this morning instead of coffee. I can’t find anything. I don’t know what appointments I’ve got.

---

## MRS. PEARCE:
Eliza would know.

---

## HIGGINS:
Of course she would, but damn it she’s gone.

---

## MRS. PEARCE:
Did any of you gentlemen frighten her last night?

---

## PICKERING:
You were there, Mrs. Pearce. We hardly said a word to her. Higgins, did you bully her after I went to bed?

---

## HIGGINS:
Just the other way around. She threw the slippers at me. I never gave her the slightest provocation.
The slippers came bang at my head before I uttered a word. And she used the most perfectly awful language. I was shocked.

---

## PICKERING:
Well, I’m dashed.

---

## HIGGINS:
I don’t understand it. She was shown every possible consideration. She admitted it herself.

---

## PICKERING:
Well, I’m dashed.

---

## HIGGINS:
For God’s sake, Pickering, stop being dashed and do something.

---

## PICKERING:
What?

---

## HIGGINS:
Call the police! What are they there for, in Heaven’s name?

---

## MRS. PEARCE:
Mr. Higgins, you can’t give Eliza’s name to the police as if she were a thief, or a lost umbrella.

---

## HIGGINS:
Why not? I want to find her! The girl belongs to me! I paid five pounds for her!

---

## PICKERING:
Quite right.
Scotland Yard, please. May I have some coffee, Mrs. Pearce?

---

## MRS. PEARCE:
Yes, sir.

## PICKERING:
Oh, good morning, old chap. Colonel Hugh Pickering here… 27-A Wimpole Street. I want to report a missing person. Anything you can do to assist in her recovery will be frightfully appreciated. I’m not without influence, and I’ll see to it that your superiors… Oh, hmph, yes… Eliza Doolittle… about twenty-eight… I should say about five foot seven… Her eyes?

## HIGGINS:
Brown!

Brown… her hair? Well, it’s a rather neutral, nondescript color, I should say more on the…

---

## HIGGINS:
Brown! Brown! Brown!

## PICKERING:
Well, you heard what he said… brown… Yes, this is her residence… Between three and four in the morning… No… No… No… No relation at all. Let’s just say a good friend.
Hmph?

Now, see here, my good man, I’m not at all pleased with the tenor of that question. What the girl does here is our affair. Your affair is to get her back so she can continue doing it…

Hello, is Brewster Budgin there, please?

Boozy? You’ll never, never, never guess who this is!... Yes, it is. By George, what a memory! How are you, old fellow? It’s so good to hear your voice again… Thirty years? Is it really? Yes… That’s a lot of water under the… uh… thing. Boozy, old chap, I’ll tell you why I called. Something rather unpleasant has happened at this end. Could I come right over and see you?

---

Oh, good. I’ll be right there. Thank you, Boozy.
I’m going over to the Home Office, Mrs… Pearce.

---

## MRS. PEARCE:
I do hope you find her, Colonel Pickering. Mr. Higgins will miss her.

---

## PICKERING:
Mr. Higgins will miss her! Blast Mr. Higgins! I’ll miss her!

---

## HIGGINS:
Pickering! Pickering!
Where’s the Colonel?

---

## MRS. PEARCE:
He’s gone over to the Home Office, sir.

You see that, Mrs. Pearce. I’m disturbed and he runs to help. Now there’s a good fellow. Mrs. Pearce, you’re a woman…

WOULD I START WEEPING LIKE A BATHTUB OVERFLOWING?

AND CARRY ON AS IF MY HOME WERE IN A TREE?

WOULD I RUN OFF AND NEVER TELL ME WHERE I’M GOING?

WHY CAN’T A WOMAN.BE LIKE ME?

---

## MRS. HIGGINS:
And you mean to say that after you did this wonderful thing for them without making a single mistake, they just sat there and never said a word to you? Never petted you, or admired you, or told you how splendid you’d been?

---

## ELIZA:
Not a word.

---

## MRS. HIGGINS:
That’s simply appalling. I should not have thrown the slippers at him… I should have thrown the fire irons.

---

## HIGGINS:
Mother! Mothers!

---

## MRS. HIGGINS:
I thought it wouldn’t be long.
Stay where you are, my dear.

---

## HIGGINS:
Mother, where the devil are you?

---

## MRS. HIGGINS:
Remember, last night you not only danced with a prince, but you behaved like a princess.

---

## HIGGINS:
Mother, the damndest…
You!

---

## ELIZA:
How do you do, Professor Higgins?
Are you quite well?

---

## HIGGINS:
Am I…

---

## ELIZA:
But of course you are. You are never ill. Would you care for some tea?

---

## HIGGINS:
Don’t you dare try that game on me! I taught it to you! Get up and come home and don’t be a fool! You’ve caused me enough trouble for one morning!

---

## MRS. HIGGINS:
Very nicely put, indeed, Henry. No woman could resist such an invitation.

---

## HIGGINS:
How did this baggage get here in the first place?

---

## MRS. HIGGINS:
Eliza came to see me, and I was delighted to have her. And if you don’t promise to behave yourself, I shall have to ask you to leave.

---

## HIGGINS:
You mean I’m to put on my Sunday manners for this thing I created out of the squashed cabbage leaves of Covent Garden?

---

## MRS. HIGGINS:
Yes, dear, that is precisely what I mean.

---

## HIGGINS:
I’ll see her damned first!

---

## MRS. HIGGINS:
How did you ever learn manners with my son around?

---

## ELIZA:
It was very difficult. I should never have known how ladies and gentlemen behave if it hadn’t been for Colonel Pickering.

---

He always showed me that he felt and thought about me as if I were something better than a common flower girl. You see, Mrs. Higgins, apart from the things one can pick up, the difference between a lady and a flower girl is not how she behaves, but how she is treated. I shall always be a flower girl to Professor Higgins because he always treats me as a flower girl and always will. But I know that I shall always be a lady to Colonel Pickering because he always treats me as a lady, and always will.

---

## MRS. HIGGINS:
Henry, please don’t grind your teeth.

---

## BUTLER:
The Vicar is here, ma’am. Shall I show him into the garden?

---

## MRS. HIGGINS:
The Vicar, and the Professor? Good Heavens, no! I’ll see him in the library.
Eliza, if my son begins to break things, I give you full permission to have him evicted.

---

Henry, dar, if I were you, I should stick to two subjects; the weather and your health.

---

## HIGGINS:
Well, Eliza, you’ve had a bit of your own back, as you call it. Have you had enough? And are you going to be reasonable? Or do you want any more?

---

## ELIZA:
You want me back only to pick up your slippers and put up with your tempers and fetch and carry for you.

---

## HIGGINS:
I haven’t said I wanted you back at all.

---

## ELIZA:
Oh, indeed. Then what are we talking about?

---

## HIGGINS:
About you, not about me. If you come back I shall treat you just as I have always treated you. I can’t change my nature; and I don’t intend to change my manners. My manners are exactly the same as Colonel Pickering’s.

---

## ELIZA:
That’s not true. He treats a flower girl as if she was a duchess.

---

## HIGGINS:
And I treat a duchess as if she was a flower girl.

---

## ELIZA:
Oh, I see. The same to everybody.

---

## HIGGINS:
Just so… The great secret, Eliza, is not having bad manners or good manners or any other particular sort of manners, but having the same manner for all human souls. The question is not whether I treat you rudely, but whether you ever heard me treat anyone else better.

---

## ELIZA:
I don’t care how you treat me. I don’t mind your swearing at me. I shouldn’t mind a black eye.I’ve had one before this. But I won’t be passed over.

---

## HIGGINS:
Then get out of my way.for I won’t stop for you. You talk about me as if I were a motor bus.

---

## ELIZA:
So you are a motor bus.all bounce and go, and no consideration for anyone. But I can get along without you. Don’t think I can’t.

---

## HIGGINS:
I know you can. I told you you could. You never wondered, I suppose, whether I could get along without you.

---

## ELIZA:
Don’t you try to get around me. You’ll have to.

---

## HIGGINS:
And so I can. Without you or any soul on earth. But I shall miss you, Eliza. I’ve learned something from your idiotic notions. I confess that humbly and gratefully.

---

## ELIZA:
Well, you have my voice on your gramophone. When you feel lonely without me you can turn it on. It’s got no feelings to hurt.

---

## HIGGINS:
I can’t turn your soul on.

---

## ELIZA:
Oh, you are a devil. You can twist the heart in a girl as easily as some can twist her arms to hurt her. What am I to come back for?

---

## HIGGINS:
For the fun of it. That’s why I took you on.

---

## ELIZA:
And you may throw me out tomorrow if I don’t do everything you want me to?

---

## HIGGINS:
Yes.and you may walk out tomorrow if I don’t do everything you want me to.

---

## ELIZA:
And live with my father?

---

## HIGGINS:
Yes, or sell flowers.
Or would you rather marry Pickering?

---

## ELIZA:
I wouldn’t marry you if you asked me; and you’re nearer my age than what he is.

---

## HIGGINS:
Than he is.

---

## ELIZA:
I’ll talk as I like.
You’re not my teacher now. That’s not what I want and don’t you think it.
I’ve always had chaps enough wanting me that way. Freddy Hill writes to me twice and three times a day, sheets and sheets.

---

## HIGGINS:
Oh, in short, you want me to be as infatuated about you as he is; is that it?

---

## ELIZA:
No, I don’t. That’s not the sort of feeling I want from you. I want a little kindness. I know I’m a common ignorant girl, and you a book-learned gentleman; but I’m not dirt under your feet. What I done –

---

What I did was not for the dresses and the taxis.I did it because we were pleasant together and I come – came to care for you; not to want you to make love to me, and not forgetting between us, but more friendly like.

---

## HIGGINS:
Yes, of course. That’s just how I feel.
And how Pickering feels. Eliza; you’re a fool.

---

## ELIZA:
That’s not a proper answer to give me.

---

## HIGGINS:
It’s the only answer you’ll get until you stop being a plain idiot.
If you’re going to be a lady you’ll have to stop feeling neglected if the men you know don’t spend half their time snivelling over you and the other half giving you black eyes.

---

You find me cold, unfeeling, selfish, don’t you? Very well! Be off with you to the sort of people you like. Marry some sentimental hog or other with lots of money, and a thick pair of lips to kiss you with and a thick pair of boots to kick you with. If you can’t appreciate what you’ve got, you’d better get what you can appreciate.

---

## ELIZA:
Oh, I can’t talk to you.you turn everything against me. I’m always in the wrong. But don’t you be too sure that you have me under your feet to be trampled on and talked down.
I’ll marry Freddy, I will, as soon as I’m able to support him.

---

## HIGGINS:
Freddy!! That poor devil who couldn’t get a job as an errand boy even if he had the guts to try for it! Woman.do you not understand? I have made you a consort for a king?

---

## ELIZA:
Freddy loves me.that makes him king enough for me. I don’t want him to work.he wasn’t brought up to it as I was. I’ll go and be a teacher.

---

## HIGGINS:
What’ll you teach, in heaven’s name?

---

## ELIZA:
What you taught me. I’ll teach phonetics.

---

## HIGGINS:
Ha! Ha! Ha!

---

## ELIZA:
I’ll offer myself as an assistant to that brilliant Hungarian!

---

## HIGGINS:
What! That imposter! That humbug! That toadying ignoramus! Teach him my methods! My discoveries!
You take one step in that direction and I’ll wring your neck.
Do you hear?

---

## ELIZA:
Wring away! What do I care. I knew you’d strike me one day.
Aha, that’s done you, ‘enry ‘iggins, it ‘as. Now I don’t care that – for your bullying and your big talk.

Of course, dear. What did you expect?

What am I to do?

Do without, I suppose.

And so I shall. If the Higgins oxygen burns up her little lungs, let her seek some stuffiness that suits her.

She’s an owl sickened by a few days of my sunshine! Very well! Let her go! I can do without her! I can do without anybody! I have my own soul! My own spark of divine fire!
