## SAM:
Hello, everybody. Good evening.

---

My name is Sam Green.

---

And this is JD Samson here.

---

And Michael O'Neill.

---

♪ [drum machine beat] ♪

---

How are you doing, JD?

---

I'm doing okay, how are you?

---

I'm good! A little nervous.

---

Hoping this all works.

---

♪ [restless beat] ♪

---

Okay, so tonight

---

JD and Michael are going to play<br>
a bunch of music for you.

---

I'm going to cue<br>
32 different sounds

---

from this computer.

---

I'll show some images,<br>
I'll talk some,

---

and together,

---

maybe even with a little help<br>
from you all,

---

we're going to make<br>
a documentary film about sound.

---


---

Before we get started,

---

I just want to mention<br>
that we'll be switching

---

between two kinds<br>
of feelings tonight.

---

First there's the magic<br>
of cinema —

---

That feeling of sitting<br>
in a theater full of strangers

---

seeing a movie and<br>
having a collective experience together. 

---

Well, we'll have that.

---

But then there's also that<br>
intimate feeling

---

when you're listening<br>
to something on headphones 

---

and you're totally alone<br>
in the world.

---

We're going to have that too.

---

This is that first<br>
modality here,

---

the collective<br>
experience of cinema.

---

You can hear the speakers<br>
on the right over here...

---

and you can hear the speakers<br>
over on the left over there...

---

We're all here<br>
in this room,

---

and hopefully we'll go <br>
somewhere together.

---

And now -

---

Let's go into that other<br>
modality, headphones,

---

and get started.

---

On the count of 8,

---

let's all put on our <br>
headphones now.

This is a recording

Aggie Murch.

She was a midwife<br>
for many years,

---

and her husband is Walter Murch

---

the famous film editor.

---

This is our first sound,<br>
sound #1,

---

the sound of the womb.

---

[rhythmic thumping
and gurgling]

---

I read an essay by Walter Murch,

---

in which he claims that

---

in this place where we all<br>
started out,

---

sound is the first sense<br>
we develop.

---

At four months old<br>
you can hear all of this,

---

but you still can't<br>
see or taste.

---

In the womb,

---

we are alone,<br>
but connected to the world

---

through sound.

---

[repeating pattern of thumps]

---

It made me wonder<br>
if this is why sound

---

has such a strange power.

---

As I was making this film,

---

a lot of people asked me,<br>
"Why sound?"

---

And to be honest,

---

I never really had<br>
a clear answer.

---

All I could say is that

---

<i>something</i> was driving me<br>
to make this movie,

---

even if I couldn't say<br>
exactly what.

I'm probably like a lot of you,<br>
in that deep in my closet,

I have a box of old stuff.

You know,
a high school yearbook

In that box there's also<br>
a bunch of cassette tapes,

I saved over the years.

I was sitting at my kitchen<br>
table late one night,

thinking about these tapes,

thinking about how they<br>
hold the voices

of so many people<br>
I've loved who are gone.

I was wondering,<br>
how does that work?

How does a little piece of<br>
eighth of an inch magnetic tape

hold a person?

Make it seem like they are alive<br>

sound is somehow

a way to understand time,

of the present moment...

All the things that I keep<br>

CHERYL:
It's about two minutes long.

SAM: The Moho Braccatus<br>
was a little Hawaiian bird

that was decimated<br>
by development

---

in the last century.

---

By the 1980s, there were only<br>
two of these birds left...

a male and a female.

So there was still hope.

Then,

in 1982,<br>
a hurricane struck

and killed the female.

only one bird left...

the male.

starts to kick in

OLD TIMEY HOST: What is involved<br>

To begin with, let's consider<br>
a very common sound.

[blustery fart]

SAM: Okay, all silliness aside.<br>
[silly farting continues]

Let's just marvel for a minute

at the journey<br>
<i>this</i> sound will take

from JD's whoopee cushion<br>
to your mind.

---

HOST:
...as the eardrum vibrates...

---

SAM:
Step one.

---

When JD squeezes<br>
the whoopee cushion,

---

there's a little valve<br>
that vibrates

---

and sends out ripples of air.

---

Step two.

---

Some of these vibrations<br>
enter your ear canal,

---

bounce off your eardrum,

---

and then vibrate<br>
three tiny bones.

---

These are the smallest bones<br>
in your entire body.

---

Step three.

---

The signal moves on<br>
to your cochlea,

---

which is a tube<br>
filled with fluid.

---

And this is where<br>
it gets really next level.

---

In the cochlea,

---

this sound becomes something<br>
completely new,

---

it transforms from a kind of<br>
mechanical vibration

---

into an electrical signal<br>
that shoots deep into your brain

---

and then becomes<br>
a thought, an idea.

---

You say to yourself,<br>
"Ah! The sound of a fart!"

♪ [contemplative xylophone<br>
and guitar] ♪

---

So back in the 1800s,

---

when people were starting<br>
to figure all this stuff out,

---

Charles Babbage was a<br>
mathematician, scientist,

---

theologian, philosopher,

---

and all around smart guy.

---

In fact, he invented...

---

the computer.

---

But he thought a lot<br>
about sound

---

and he came<br>
to a scientific conclusion

---

that since sound is<br>
fundamentally just vibrations

---

like ripples on the water,

---

then all the sounds<br>
in the world

---

should still be bouncing around<br>
out there somewhere,

---

just super quiet.

---

He thought that with<br>
the right <i>receiving machine</i>,

---

and the right kind<br>
of <i>decoding technology</i>,

---

we should be able<br>
to listen again

---

to every conversation and joke,

---

every declaration of love

---

or angry words ever spoken.

---

It should all be out there.

---

He wrote, quote,

---

"The air itself<br>
is one vast library

---

"on whose pages<br>
are forever written

---

"all that man has ever said

---

or woman whispered."

---


---

Charles Babbage wrote that<br>
in 1837.

---

And I guess<br>
the implication is that,

---

if he ever said <br>
these words aloud,

---

they too should still<br>
be out there somewhere,

---

tiny ripples vibrating

---

along with<br>
all these other moments.

SAM (OFF-CAMERA): So basically,<br>
just what <i>are</i> you doing?

---

ANNEA: [chuckling]<br>
I'm listening to what -

---

to a whole other world<br>
down there.

---

I mean, when I first<br>
put a hydrophone into a river,

---

which was the Danube,

---

I was astonished by how much<br>
was happening there

---

and how much was totally<br>
inaudible at the surface.

---

Or another way of<br>
thinking about it is,

---

how <i>very</i> different<br>
the surface world of a river is

---

from the underwater world<br>
of a river

---

and how <i>rich</i><br>
that underwater world was.

---

It was astounding.<br>
Whether it was...

---

aquatic insects,

---

bugs, fish

---

that I was hearing<br>
or whether it was just

---

the play of the currents<br>
underwater,

---

which are delicious

---

and make the most<br>
beautiful sounds.

---

I always say they have<br>
lovely phrasing, they do!

---

They're musical.

something, if he's able to.

from the reeds to myself,<br>
or the bugs to myself

and undoubtedly back again,<br>
somehow or other.

always came out<br>

could move in space<br>

SAM: I saw a Broadway play<br>
that used binaural sound

---

a few years ago,<br>
and it blew my mind.

---

But nobody's using this<br>
in films yet

---

'cause they can't figure out<br>
how to do it.

---

Speakers don't really work

---

with this new<br>
spatial sound technology.

---

And it's a huge pain in the ass

---

to travel around with<br>
all these headphones,

---

and --<br>
oh, yeah,

---

please do not <i>steal</i><br>
the headphones after the show.

---

They're ours.<br>
We brought 'em here.

---

And they won't work<br>
with your devices anyway!

Alright, okay, so what?

Okay, my name is Edgar,<br>

---

Ah. Okay.<br>
My name is Edgar.

---

And um, I'm a scientist.<br>
I work in sound.

---

This is my faithful assistant.

---

His name is Johann Kristoff.

---

What's special<br>
about Johann Kristoff

---

is his microphones<br>
in his ears.

---

It's designed to capture sound<br>
exactly how you hear it.

---

SAM: What is spatial sound<br>
first of all?

---

For people who don't -

---

[overlapping]

---

Most people have heard<br>
of surround sound.

---

So surround sound<br>
envelops you with sound.

---

[immersive THX audio intro]

note: next slide as sound climaxes

---

[climactic tone]

---

You put loud speakers<br>
around you.

---

And you get sound coming<br>
from everywhere in your -

---

---

which is great<br>
for Hollywood movies.

---

But it's not how it works<br>
in real life.

---

♪ [ethereal vocals] ♪

---

SAM:
In real life,

---

sounds can come<br>
from very far away...

---

[a hawk shrieks]

---

or very close to you.

---

[goofy mouth sounds]

---

And as they bounce off<br>
your head

---

and those weird ridges<br>
in your ears...

---

and as they travel<br>
through your skull,

---

they're muffled<br>
in very particular ways

---

that your brain actually uses

---

to make sense of<br>
where they came from.

---

[warbling echoes]

---

EDGAR:<br>
Spatial sound is technology

---

that allows you to capture sound

---

and produce it exactly<br>
where it was

---

in space, in 3D space,<br>
including

---

very close to you<br>
or very far from you

---

or above you or under,<br>
underneath you.

So this way<br>
you can hear birds in the sky

[chirping]

---

[rippling water]

um, or a wave of the sea.<br>
[a wave breaks]

---

You can also get proximity -

which, which surround sound<br>
cannot give you.

[shaking a matchbox]

the continuum<br>
which has always been there.

They talked on the phone,<br>

And back then,

talking on the phone<br>
was a bigger deal.

treasury of lost sounds.

And that is an interesting<br>
phenomenon

because on the one hand,<br>
it's, it's, it's a lament

---

for a sound that you<br>
will never hear again,

that you can't reproduce.

---

But it's a lament<br>
that only ever manifests itself

---

by way of the experience of<br>
actually hearing

---

this unhearable sound.

---

You know, so there's like<br>
this ghost of a sound.

---

There's these ghosts of sounds<br>
in my mind.

---

I can almost hear<br>
my grandfather,

---

I can almost hear my mom

---

I can almost hear, you know,<br>
my father, my aunts,

---

you know, I can almost hear<br>
my grandmother.

---

Um, and that, that -

---

in a lot of ways,<br>
my most sorta...

---

the most sort of dominant<br>
sonic experiences I have

---

are these ghost sounds,

---

the sounds of people<br>
who are gone.

---

Y'know, I can almost hear Jose,

---

you know, I can't hear him,<br>
but I can alm--

---

You know what I'm talking about!

---

You know, you can,<br>
I can almost hear,

---

you know,

---

so when you lose someone,<br>
you, you -

---

you lose the possibility<br>
of hearing them again.

---

And you are at the same time

---

thrust into this reality of,<br>
in a weird way,

---

almost hearing them<br>
all the time.

---

You know, um...

---

it's a... it's...

---

and that becomes part of<br>
the general sonic texture

---

that you live in, you know?

---

Which then is part of the<br>
general sensual texture,

---

so to speak, that you live in,
so...

translates to:

VOICE: Shin for Japanese<br>
is a word to describe

a type of silence.

An onomatopoeia<br>

Around this time,<br>
my younger brother

had recently died.

---

He'd taken<br>
his own life actually,

---

and I was a mess.

I was thinking about<br>
the fleeting nature of things

all the time.

---

It weighed on me.

[echoing fog horns]

At the same time,

I was going through the motions<br>

which seemed oddly appropriate.

---

[horns continue throughout]

I did a bunch of interviews<br>
for the film

---

and most people said<br>
pretty superficial things.

---

But then there was this one guy,

---

an old San Francisco writer<br>
named Harold Gilliam.

---

Harold was in his 90s

---

and one of those old people<br>
who can't sleep,

---

and he talked a lot<br>
about being awake

---

and alone late at night<br>
and hearing the foghorns.

---

[a short honk]

---

HAROLD: In the army,<br>
I came here after the war

---

in a hospital ship

---

because I had an arm injury<br>
from overseas.

---

I landed at Letterman hospital.

---

The first night I was there<br>
I was scared

---

because...

---

I was still conditioned<br>
to hearing artillery fire

---

and ducking<br>
under the bed someplace.

---

And I heard this great noise,<br>
a great sound,

---

rattle the windows<br>
and rattled me too.

---

[a deep blast]

---

I thought<br>
how am I going to sleep

---

down here every night<br>
with all this going on?

---

[another foghorn bellows...]

---

[then bellows again]

---

But I finally got used to it<br>
after a few days.

---

And after that I...

---

I couldn't sleep<br>
when the foghorn stopped

---

because it was part of<br>
the whole process of sleeping.

---

[interview audio fading out]<br>
Walking around from...

---

SAM: At a certain point<br>
in the interview,

---

all of a sudden Harold<br>
went somewhere

---

completely unexpected and deep.

HAROLD: I hope they never<br>
take off the fog horns.

---

They, uh...

---

provide a sense of people

---

who are asleep or half asleep

---

or somehow staying up at night,<br>
[distant foghorns]

---

giving them a sense of the bay,

---

that there are ships<br>
out there on the bay,

---

that the ocean is rolling<br>
out there.

---

And that the earth is turning.

---

This whole process of being<br>
part of this total

---

community of life<br>
and non-life on Earth

---

is a very,<br>
can be a very intense,

---

uh...feeling.

---

A, a depth of,<br>
of sensation

that it's hard to describe.

SAM: I'll think of this when<br>

because I do really feel<br>
like they're a strange,

---

---

of very late night...

HAROLD: Well I admire your<br>

some of these factors...

what's called room tone.

It's just sitting still<br>

I was talking to my friend

---

who's a huge Hollywood<br>
sound designer

---

about how much better headphones<br>
are than speakers,

---

and he said,

---

"But headphones<br>
don't do under 80 cycles."

---

I said, "What's 80 cycles?"

---

And he said, "All that<br>
super low end stuff,

---

"the kind of sound<br>
that hits you in the gut."

---

[low frequency buzz]<br>
And I thought, Oh yeah!

---

If we are thinking of sound<br>
in an expansive sense,

---

if we're using sound<br>
to understand something

---

about the odd experience<br>
of being alive,

---

then considering how sound<br>
not only goes in your ears

---

but hits your whole body<br>
if it's low enough

---

seems important.

---

So I figured<br>
now we could do something

---

with these big subwoofers<br>
over there.

---

And I was thinking of things

---

that involve a lot of<br>
really low end sound,

---

and then I realized:

---

big sounds that move your body?

---

That's what DJs do.

---

That's what being in a club

---

and losing yourself in sound<br>
is all about.

---

And we have a world famous DJ<br>
right here.

---

So this is a 5 minute<br>
dance interlude.

Feel free to get up,<br>
move around.

Remember Babbage's idea<br>
that sounds never die,

that every sound<br>
is still out there

And that if we just<br>
had the right kind of decoder

we could replay anything?

They're logical,

a great comfort in the idea

that nothing is lost,

that it's all still out there.

But he was working<br>
with Newtonian physics

and in that world,<br>
things were stable and knowable.

I used the machine to record<br>

At some point,

"You know where all this<br>

And I said,<br>
"No, I really don't."

And she said,

"It's clearly all heading<br>

"playing some of those<br>
old tapes you have.

"All those old ghosts.

I'm sure your brother Dave's<br>

I said, "No way.

"I <i>can't</i> do that.

---

"First of all,<br>
hearing all those voices

"would be too much.<br>
It would be like -

---

"those people were here<br>
in the room with us.

---

"And then what's even worse<br>
is I would play the tapes

---

"over and over at each show,<br>
and I would get used to it.

---

"That magic thing where a tape<br>
actually holds a person

---

"would wear off.

---

I wouldn't feel it anymore."

- I asked you

---

if you were listening to music<br>
and you said "No."

---

- Yeah. T--<br>
- Because it was too intense.

---

- Yeah.<br>
- But you said you are

---

going out on your deck<br>
and listening to the world.

---

- Yeah.<br>
- I just, I love that image.

---

I thought that was very moving,<br>
and so...

---

That's why I wanted to film you.<br>
- Thank you. Thank you.

---

Yeah, it's been,<br>
it's taken a while

---

for me to come back<br>
to listening to music

---

because it moves me<br>
far too much, you know,

---

because it's so,<br>
so intrinsically associated

---

with our life together.

---

And Ruth died<br>
in November of last year.

---

So it's been a process of...<br>
learning what that means.

---

And, and music<br>
just gets to me so fast.

---

But little by little.

---

SAM: But the sound of the...

---

world -<br>
- Ah. Yeah...

---

- is soothing?

---


---

- Ah...

---

The easiest thing to say is,<br>
it's where I live.

---

So it's home.

---


---

So yes,<br>
I suppose it is soothing.
