---
## SPEAKER:
When I think of country X,
the thinking starts from darkness.
---
By that, I mean the same darkness
as the blank space
---
in your mind before thought forms.
---
Does that make sense?
---
Do you know what I'm talking about?
---
Because all thoughts and hence
all universes really start
---
because they have to, right?
---
From nothing in the beginning, right?
---
[chuckles]
That's all I'm saying.
---
When I think of country X,
it starts because it has to,
---
with my eyes closed.
---
Then here's what I do.
---
Because I haven't been to country
X before,
---
I think back to a country
that I have been to, country W,
---
which borders country X,
and hence they have a similar feel.
---
At least I think they have a similar feel
because they look the same in photographs.
---
Anyway, borders are man-made
so they might as well be the same country
---
as far as the earth cares.
---
This makes sense, right?
---
You've done this before too
when imagining places you haven't been to.
---
I stopped here for about a week,
this country similar to country X,
---
and I stayed at a small hotel
on a dirt road.
---
The ocean wasn't far off.
---
There were palm trees, warm rain,
a gentle tropical breeze.
---
There were jungles
and mountains in the distance.
---
You could smell the wet soil.
---
Can you picture what I'm describing?
---
Can you fill in the rest
of the picture yourself?
---
This is how I picture country X
in my mind.
---
Yes, I know it's reductive,
and I know I'm romanticizing it,
---
and it's infinitely more complex
than jungles and mountains,
---
but I'm just trying to be honest about
how my mind makes it's first sketches.
---
I don't have any expectations.
---
I'm ready for whatever
the country gives me.
---
I'm joining my fiancé there.
---
I'm going to country X to live.
---
[music]
---
## SPEAKER:
I've enjoyed our talk.
---
## SPEAKER:
So have I.
---
## SPEAKER:
It's refreshing talking to you.
---
## SPEAKER:
How so?
---
## SPEAKER:
Everyone going to Country X
these days just seems
---
to talk about opportunity.
---
[whispers] Opportunity.
---
## SPEAKER:
That kind of describes my fiancé
doing business over there and all.
---
You don't fault me for that?
---
## SPEAKER:
You're not your fiancé.
---
## SPEAKER:
I'll be living off
of his opportunity.
---
## SPEAKER:
We all have to live somehow.
---
## SPEAKER:
R, my fiancé,
---
says I don't have to work
if I don't want to.
---
I plan to, but first I want to take
some time to really get to know
---
Country X in a deeper way.
[chuckles]
---
## SPEAKER:
What is it?
---
## SPEAKER:
No, I just know
that sounds naïve.
---
## SPEAKER:
How come?
---
## SPEAKER:
Oh, "Know the country
in a deep way." [chuckles]
---
## SPEAKER:
Well, that is what you should do,
right?
---
## SPEAKER:
Yes, I guess.
---
## SPEAKER:
Though of course,
there are limits to what you can know,
---
especially with Country X.
---
## SPEAKER:
Why especially?
---
## SPEAKER:
Well,
it's in a different position
---
because it's under our control.
---
## SPEAKER:
Of course, yes.
---
Why are you more Country X?
---
Did I even ask you?
---
We were talking
about me the whole time.
---
## SPEAKER:
I was asking you.
---
I'm taking a teaching position
there at the national school.
---
## SPEAKER:
Have you been
to Country X before?
---
## SPEAKER:
Briefly, while traveling.
---
Hey, when we disembark,
---
why don't we do some
of our exploring together?
---
## SPEAKER:
I would like that very much.
---
## SPEAKER:
It looks so good.
---
## SPEAKER:
B, come join us.
---
## SPEAKER:
We have tea.
## SPEAKER:
We're serving tea.
---
## SPEAKER:
Tea, yes. Thanks.
---
Professor, oh, so good to see you.
---
## SPEAKER:
It's good to see you.
---
You're famous now.
---
A full file in the nation, you've arrived.
---
## SPEAKER:
It's not a big deal.
---
## SPEAKER:
Of course, it is.
Best doctor in Country X, that's--
---
## SPEAKER:
The best Country X doctor
in Country X.
---
## SPEAKER:
Oh, no. Don't start.
## SPEAKER:
Did I say Country X doctor?
---
## SPEAKER:
You're diminishing the moment.
## SPEAKER:
They're diminishing it,
---
like it's some big surprise that Country X
does good in medical school.
---
## SPEAKER:
I know, I know.
---
## SPEAKER:
We deserve more than scraps.
---
Sorry, not scraps.
---
Hey, congratulations.
---
Truly, best doctor in the country.
---
We have known this all along.
[toasts] To B.
---
All: To B.
---
## SPEAKER:
B, I'm so glad I caught you,
---
but I'm afraid
I was just on my way out.
---
My temple duties call.
---
## SPEAKER:
Be well, professor.
---
## SPEAKER:
Thanks for the tea.
---
Bye.
## SPEAKER:
Bye.
---
## SPEAKER:
Well, ta-ta, so--
---
[laughter]
## SPEAKER:
Now that the holy one is out.
---
No, but seriously,
maybe B can settle our debate.
---
## SPEAKER:
Ah, yes.
---
## SPEAKER:
What debate?
---
## SPEAKER:
Our esteemed holy man,
our religious studies professor,
---
was uncomfortable taking sides
and condemning his fellow human beings,
---
but you'll have no problem with that,
will you, B?
---
## SPEAKER:
Oh, no. Not at all,
so what's this debate you're having?
---
Let me hear it.
---
## SPEAKER:
The question on the table is,
---
is it possible to be friends
with a Country Y citizen?
---
## SPEAKER:
Is it possible to be friends
with a Country Y citizen?
---
## SPEAKER:
That's the question
of the evening.
---
## SPEAKER:
Was this your idea?
---
## SPEAKER:
I don't remember
how it came up.
---
## SPEAKER:
Oh, he just said,
out of the blue,
---
question of the evening.
---
Do you think it's possible
---
to be friends with a Country Y citizen?
[laughter]
---
## SPEAKER:
Indeed, yes.
## SPEAKER:
Well, then that's how it came up.
---
## SPEAKER:
What do you mean by friend?
---
## SPEAKER:
Defining terms, a true scientist.
---
## SPEAKER:
We've settled
on more than a casual acquaintance,
---
someone you trust dearly
and enjoy spending time with.
---
## SPEAKER:
Actually enjoy spending time.
---
## SPEAKER:
Actually, okay.
## SPEAKER:
Trust, that's the most important.
---
## SPEAKER:
Okay, I get it.
## SPEAKER:
Respect,
---
you have to respect your friends.
## SPEAKER:
Okay, so friends, friends.
---
You know, friends,
there's your definition.
---
## SPEAKER:
Like us.
---
## SPEAKER:
Where did the sides stand?
---
## SPEAKER:
Well,
---
knowing full well H's softbox agenda
for raising the question,
---
I did a contrarian view,
but one I actually believe.
---
I said yes, of course it's possible.
---
We're human beings, right?
---
Then I'd say the burden of empathy
---
would in fact lie
with a Country Y citizen.
---
They have to make the bigger effort.
---
## SPEAKER:
Burden of empathy, that is good.
---
Empathy is a burden to them.
---
## SPEAKER:
If H isn't being empathetic
right now
---
by not taking my argument seriously.
## SPEAKER:
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
---
## SPEAKER:
Yes, once the position
of power is acknowledged,
---
that's the first step. A big step
towards a hypothetical friendship,
---
and it's possible.
---
## SPEAKER:
Because you have Y friends,
that's how you know it's possible.
---
## SPEAKER:
Sure, okay.
## SPEAKER:
Like your new friend,
---
a new teacher at the national school.
---
## SPEAKER:
Exactly, yes.
He's very nice.
---
## SPEAKER:
I'm sure he is.
## SPEAKER:
You'd like him.
---
## SPEAKER:
I'd like to meet him.
---
Okay, point, counterpoint.
---
## SPEAKER:
I think it is impossible
to be true friends
---
with a Country Y citizen
because true friendship does,
---
it just does,
---
require a certain baseline
of equalness between them.
---
The oppression and crimes that Country X
has endured and continues to endure
---
at the hands of Country Y
are just too great
---
and haven't been drained
from the bloodstream.
---
The disparities the two potential friends
would start with in this current time,
---
here and now,
are just too great to overcome.
---
## SPEAKER:
To be equals?
## SPEAKER:
Yes,
---
even if you meet
the most humble, caring, giving,
---
Country Y citizen.
---
## SPEAKER:
Like this new teacher
that you're talking about?
---
## SPEAKER:
I'm sure he's a lovely person,
but he's still,
---
and he can't help it, I know this,
---
but he still has embedded
within him an inherited power
---
which he can't give away or dismiss.
---
By design, you can't be equals.
---
## SPEAKER:
Okay, so then my response
was what H says is absolutely true,
---
but when we think about us
and them,
---
we can activate a different kind
of headspace if we choose instead
---
of focusing solely
on how much power they have.
---
Are you going to let me finish?
---
I was saying that focusing
on how much power
---
they have ends up reinforcing their power
and gives us
---
this perpetual victim identity--
---
## SPEAKER:
I wasn't saying our identity is--
---
## SPEAKER:
To focus on that instead
of cultivating the power we have
---
inside ourselves, as opposed to--
---
## SPEAKER:
No, no, no,
---
it's not an either/or thing--
## SPEAKER:
As opposed to only defining
---
ourselves in relation to them,
and yes it's not either/or.
---
That's what I'm saying.
---
## SPEAKER:
Huh?
---
What?
## SPEAKER:
Wait. [laughs]
---
## SPEAKER:
You can't downplay
what they did.
---
## SPEAKER:
I'm not.
---
## SPEAKER:
That's sticking your head
in the sands.
---
## SPEAKER:
I'm saying let's not start
the argument with everything's hopeless.
---
That we don't have the capacity
to make friends
---
with an entire race
of people because that,
---
that's sticking your head in the sand.
## SPEAKER:
That's precise.
---
Even if you meet the most enlightened
Country Y citizen,
---
if they don't abuse this power
they've been given,
---
that just means the power
will work in other ways.
---
They'll overcompensate or patronize,
---
even if they don't know
they're patronizing.
---
They will act on the fact
that we are Country X.
---
That's just the truth.
---
## SPEAKER:
We're all going to die,
that's another truth.
---
It's defeatist.
## SPEAKER:
As long as they remain here
---
in our country, it is our country.
---
Okay, B, where do you stand?
---
What is the good doctor's opinion?
---
## SPEAKER:
Oh, I don't know
if I want to get involved now.
---
## SPEAKER:
Oh, come on.
It's all in good fun.
---
## SPEAKER:
Fun. Oh, okay.
## SPEAKER:
Fun, yes, this is fun.
---
Come on B, what side are you on?
---
Are you all friendly with Country Y now
because of the article?
---
## SPEAKER:
Hey, look.
Don't you bring that up.
---
## SPEAKER:
I'm kidding.
B knows I'm kidding.
---
## SPEAKER:
You were--
## SPEAKER:
Over the line.
---
## SPEAKER:
You were at the line.
## SPEAKER:
Ah, okay. I'm sorry.
---
I'm stepping back from the line.
---
## SPEAKER:
Back up, yes.
---
[laughs]
---
Well, okay.
---
To be honest, the other day,
---
I had a little moment where I was waiting
for a pedicab outside the hospital.
---
One slows down,
driven by a Country X-er,
---
but then he sees a Country Y doctor
a few paces down
---
who definitely came after me.
He quickly speeds up,
---
goes right past me to get to her.
---
As he's passing, he gives me
this look like a shark,
---
like, "Sorry, got to do what I got to do."
---
I'm like, "Oh, okay.
Did that just happen?"
---
As much as I want
to agree with M's optimism,
---
if the question is can I be friends
with a citizen of Y?
---
That's not my mood today.
---
## SPEAKER:
Well now.
---
## SPEAKER:
In your scenario,
that's the fault of the driver, right?
---
If he had picked you up,
there wouldn't be a problem.
---
Let's make sure we know
who's really to blame here.
---
## SPEAKER:
Are you kidding me?
---
The driver is a gutless
shit brain infected by Country Y.
---
## SPEAKER:
Yes, okay.
That's the problem I was speaking to.
---
If he had dignity and inner strength,
he wouldn't have done that.
---
## SPEAKER:
No, this speaks to my point.
---
It's the young doctor
who should have seen B waiting.
---
Was it obvious you were there first
and waiting?
---
## SPEAKER:
It was, yes.
## SPEAKER:
Yes, so the young Y doctor
---
abused her position of power.
---
## SPEAKER:
I'm just saying,
why can we always be
---
on the Country Y doctor, yes,
but also the Country X driver.
---
He's not just some helpless child blowing
in the wind.
---
## SPEAKER:
See, that right there,
that is the problem.
---
## SPEAKER:
What?
---
## SPEAKER:
Both sides
share equal responsibility?
---
No, no, no.
## SPEAKER:
I'm not saying we're equal.
---
I'm trying to talk about mindset.
---
How we see ourselves, as victims?
---
## SPEAKER:
Well, yes.
I think anyone who gives Country Y a pass
---
needs to see what kind of a mindset
they have.
---
## SPEAKER:
What's that supposed to mean?
---
## SPEAKER:
Okay, look, can we just--
---
## SPEAKER:
Finish the thought.
## SPEAKER:
Can we step back for a--
---
## SPEAKER:
No, tell me
what you meant by that.
---
## SPEAKER:
I'm just being rational.
## SPEAKER:
No, you're being personal.
---
## SPEAKER:
No, rational,
---
because there's a rationality
to how people's world views are formed.
---
## SPEAKER:
Go on, continue.
---
## SPEAKER:
It's rational to start
identifying with the people who pay you.
---
## SPEAKER:
Wow.
You seriously just said that?
---
## SPEAKER:
You were doing fine on your own.
---
Your own boss, your own business.
---
You didn't need to merge
with countrywide corporations.
---
You didn't need to take their money,
but you did.
---
You gave them control.
---
## SPEAKER:
How long were you waiting
to say this?
---
## SPEAKER:
It's how I feel, but it's fine.
---
I understand. It's okay.
---
I'm just saying there are reasons why
I can say you've changed
---
your views on Country Y.
## SPEAKER:
How dare you?
---
How dare you call me a sell out?
---
## SPEAKER:
I didn't call you a sell out.
---
## SPEAKER:
I didn't grow up like you did.
---
You got that?
---
I had to go out and work and take care
of myself because no one else did.
---
Not even my fellow X-ers, okay?
---
I had to find my own strength
by myself.
---
This is why I talk about inner strength.
---
## SPEAKER:
Okay, I get it.
---
## SPEAKER:
To get here to this place
where I am proud of who I am,
---
yes, I took advantage
of opportunities with Country Y-ers
---
who have been accepting of me, okay?
---
They have.
## SPEAKER:
I accept you.
---
## SPEAKER:
No, you don't.
---
Not when you sit here
and judge me like this for the way
---
I've lived my life when you've always
just sat here in your fucking mansion,
---
free to take any uncompromising position
you want
---
which not all of us can afford to do.
---
## SPEAKER:
Well, this isn't a mansion.
---
## SPEAKER:
Are you taking this seriously?
---
## SPEAKER:
Yes. Yes, I am.
## SPEAKER:
Are you taking me seriously?
---
## SPEAKER:
Yes. Can I respond?
## SPEAKER:
Arm chair activism.
---
## SPEAKER:
Can I respond?
---
I understand and respect
self-empowerment.
---
I do, but now
that you're in a better position,
---
it is time for group empowerment.
---
## SPEAKER:
How dare you suggest
I don't support our group.
---
## SPEAKER:
Now, I'm talking
about mindset because this is a war.
---
Okay?
That's what this is.
---
In times of war, everything,
---
anything and everything depends on us
all being on the same side,
---
being comrades in this war.
---
If you can't say that Country Y is evil,
---
and I'm not talking about the people
and the nature of their souls
---
in some hypothetical cultureless realm.
---
I'm not talking about the little acts
of kindness
---
they may dole out from time to time.
---
I'm talking about
what they are actually doing as a whole.
---
What they are doing,
and you know this to be true,
---
what they are doing is not seeing us
as human beings.
---
As actual human beings.
---
They're inflicting violence on us
from this line of sight
---
and the ones who are literally
perpetrating the violence
---
are tacitly accepting the violence
from the same,
---
this very same line of sight.
---
Yes, tacit acceptance is the reason why
that little boy was violently thrown
---
into a jail cell over batteries.
---
Okay? Batteries.
---
What kind of a country
am I bringing my boy
---
into where he can be thrown like
a rag doll onto a cold cement floor
---
just because some officer felt like it.
---
That's why this is a war.
---
That's why they are responsible, not us.
---
All of them living here are complicit
because they allow it.
---
If you can't take a stand
and say that Country Y is evil--
---
[scoffs]
---
## SPEAKER:
Then?
---
## SPEAKER:
M, I don't know.
---
Frankly, I don't see how we can go on.
---
## SPEAKER:
Well, I'm glad to hear you feel
so strongly about our friendship.
---
## SPEAKER:
Wait, wait.
What was that?
---
## SPEAKER:
It's been brewing
for a long time.
---
## SPEAKER:
What has?
---
## SPEAKER:
You can't really be friends
with someone who doesn't respect you.
---
## SPEAKER:
M respects you
and you disagree, but it's not--
---
## SPEAKER:
But we are too far gone.
---
Matter of fact, for a long time now.
---
## SPEAKER:
What?
---
You're not friends anymore?
---
## SPEAKER:
What can I say?
---
No respect, no friendship.
---
## SPEAKER:
She respects you.
You don't respect her as a person.
---
## SPEAKER:
You can't respect
a fundamentally different worldview.
---
M is the whole person.
That's what a worldview is.
---
That's who you are as a whole.
---
You don't agree, huh?
---
It's just a string?
---
## SPEAKER:
Sorry to interrupt,
but there's a message for B.
---
## SPEAKER:
I've been summoned
to the hospital.
---
## SPEAKER:
It's your day off, right?
## SPEAKER:
Emergency. I got to run.
---
## SPEAKER:
I should tell you,
the roads are closed now.
---
## SPEAKER:
What?
## SPEAKER:
All of them?
---
## SPEAKER:
The protests have come this way.
---
No vehicles.
---
## SPEAKER:
I guess I'm lucky.
---
This isn't over.
---
## SPEAKER:
Goodbye, friend.
---
## SPEAKER:
Hello. Excuse me.
## SPEAKER:
Yes. What is it, B?
---
## SPEAKER:
You called for me.
## SPEAKER:
I called for you?
---
## SPEAKER:
I was at a friend's house
having tea.
---
I got a message saying I was summoned
for an emergency.
---
## SPEAKER:
All right.
That was ages ago.
---
## SPEAKER:
The roads were blocked up
so I had to walk.
---
## SPEAKER:
Well, turns out
we didn't need you anyway.
---
An attendant said the patient
had a heart problem,
---
but turns out that was a mistake.
---
Not the heart after all.
---
There you are.
---
You're free to go.
---
Is there a problem?
---
I'm sorry about the mistake.
---
## SPEAKER:
Oh, it was just my day off.
---
## SPEAKER:
I just said I was sorry.
---
## SPEAKER:
You're right.
---
Thank you.
---
## SPEAKER:
For?
---
## SPEAKER:
The apology.
---
## SPEAKER:
Oh,
---
you're welcome.
---
## SPEAKER:
Well, I guess I should just—
## SPEAKER:
Oh, wait a minute.
---
You're not upset, are you?
## SPEAKER:
No, of course not.
---
## SPEAKER:
Well, the thing
is what if we did need you?
---
## SPEAKER:
I don't understand.
---
## SPEAKER:
It's been an hour
since I first called for you.
---
You're supposed to be here for emergencies
even on your days off.
---
## SPEAKER:
I had to walk
for an hour to get here.
---
The roads were closed
because of the protests.
---
## SPEAKER:
Look,
---
it's your responsibility to be here
within 20 minutes if we need you.
---
No excuses.
---
Is this going to be an issue with you?
---
## SPEAKER:
No, no issue.
---
## SPEAKER:
I guess that's it, right?
---
## SPEAKER:
This place, this is the place
I'm standing in it right now.
---
It is a holy place for citizens of X.
---
No one quite remembers why this place
was marked as sacred but it was,
---
and so it remains.
---
It is a place marked for peace.
---
How would you talk about this temple?
---
## SPEAKER:
Well, when we come here,
we agree that the rest of the world,
---
all of its problems,
poisons, complications,
---
unite into a singular insignificance.
---
We agree they are insignificant
in the face of--
---
## SPEAKER:
The great cosmos?
## SPEAKER:
Sure,
---
the great cosmos,
the cosmos beyond and also the one within.
---
This is the place where we return
inside ourselves to a place
---
that's ours and ours alone,
a place that is marked by childhood.
---
Do you know what I mean when I talk
about an interior place like this?
---
If I say valley, if I say green valley.
---
Okay, close your eyes.
---
Please try this with me.
---
Seriously, close your eyes.
---
If I say green valley, misty green valley,
---
bordering a forest and a cabin on the edge
of the forest with a warm light inside.
---
You can picture these, right?
---
Make them your own and does this--
Keep your eyes closed.
---
Does this take you back to childhood?
---
What I'm really asking is does
this process of picturing these things,
---
valley, forest, cabin, of arranging them
and making a continuous landscape,
---
that forest cabin,
---
does this remind you of how you once
imagined things when you were a child?
---
Okay, you can open your eyes.
---
Does this process then of creating
and exploring your universe feel sacred
---
in the same way the innocence
of childhood feels sacred?
---
Our imagination was more accessible
back then, wasn't it?
---
Weren't we more in touch
with our inner selves back then
---
before we grew older
and became aware of more people,
---
and saw how many other universes
there really are?
---
Yet,
---
wasn't there always a tiny kernel
of hope back in the day in thinking
---
your interior universe
was the one true universe?
---
Does this ring true?
---
Did you feel that as a child?
---
## SPEAKER:
How did I end here?
[laughter]
---
## SPEAKER:
The temple then is a vessel
in which you can return
---
to that private universe deep
inside yourself and explore it
---
and call it sacred,
but here you feel it is not
---
and it never was a lonely place
because others come here too
---
and remember childhood
in the same way you do.
---
You feel communion with them,
even if you can't see them.
---
It is communion between what is inside
and what is beyond yourself.
---
This is what is called God.
---
## SPEAKER:
Hey, you there.
## SPEAKER:
Yes.
---
## SPEAKER:
Take off your shoes
when you enter this place.
---
## SPEAKER:
I have.
---
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to disturb you.
I can leave.
---
## SPEAKER:
No, it's okay.
---
I didn't see your feet.
---
I apologize.
---
## SPEAKER:
If I'm not supposed to be here--
## SPEAKER:
Everyone's allowed in the temple.
---
## SPEAKER:
But you don't want me here--
## SPEAKER:
You don't need to patronize me.
---
## SPEAKER:
Oh, I didn't mean to.
---
## SPEAKER:
To be overly concerned
about my wishes?
---
I said you're allowed in the temple,
so do what you want.
---
## SPEAKER:
I'm just entering a space
I don't know much about,
---
so I'm treading with care.
---
## SPEAKER:
Please, come in.
---
## SPEAKER:
Do you feel it?
---
## SPEAKER:
Feel what?
---
## SPEAKER:
The night around us encroaching.
---
You're supposed to agree
with everything I say.
---
## SPEAKER:
Oh, I--
## SPEAKER:
That was a joke.
---
## SPEAKER:
[laughs]
---
## SPEAKER:
Well, I feel
something encroaching.
---
I didn't call it night in my mind.
## SPEAKER:
What is it?
---
## SPEAKER:
Okay. Whatever it is,
it's not encroaching exactly.
---
I'm realizing it's just there.
Does that make sense?
---
## SPEAKER:
It does.
---
## SPEAKER:
I can hear the sounds
of the jungle,
---
but this thing is also,
---
it's people and houses
and cars and animals.
---
## SPEAKER:
How it extends
beyond these walls.
---
## SPEAKER:
The walls feel thin now.
---
Yes, I can feel the night air.
---
## SPEAKER:
Like we're not in the room
at all.
---
You're not a normal, are you?
---
## SPEAKER:
What's normal?
---
I know this sounds forward,
but are you Dr. B?
---
## SPEAKER:
Yes, I am.
---
## SPEAKER:
I recognize your photo
from the magazine.
---
## SPEAKER:
Ah, yes, the
article. ## SPEAKER:
My name is F.
---
I'm a teacher at the National School.
---
I'm new here.
---
## SPEAKER:
You came up in conversation.
## SPEAKER:
What?
---
## SPEAKER:
My friend M said she met
a new Country Y teacher.
---
## SPEAKER:
Oh, M.
Yes, I met her at the clubhouse.
---
I like her.
## SPEAKER:
She likes you.
---
## SPEAKER:
Wow.
Small world.
---
[silence]
---
## SPEAKER:
You, you work
at King's Hospital, right?
---
## SPEAKER:
Yes. How did you--
## SPEAKER:
Oh, from the article.
---
## SPEAKER:
Of course.
---
## SPEAKER:
I recently met someone
who worked there too.
---
## SPEAKER:
Oh, who?
## SPEAKER:
Dr. D.
---
Is that--
## SPEAKER:
She is my boss.
---
## SPEAKER:
Ah, small world.
---
## SPEAKER:
Yes.
---
## SPEAKER:
The Country Y clubhouse
is every expat at once.
---
Do you like working for her,
Dr. D?
---
## SPEAKER:
Do I like working for her?
---
## SPEAKER:
Say no more.
You just said it all.
---
## SPEAKER:
Did you enjoy her company?
---
## SPEAKER:
I'm going to take a risk here
and tell you what I really think.
---
## SPEAKER:
The truth can be risky.
---
## SPEAKER:
I'm feeling bold,
but on first impression,
---
I generally got the sense
that some small animal
---
must have crawled into her ass
and died there.
---
[laughter]
---
## SPEAKER:
I went too far.
---
## SPEAKER:
Oh, no.
[laughs]
---
You're very perceptive,
but actually it did happen.
---
## SPEAKER:
Oh, yes?
## SPEAKER:
Yes, it was a marmot.
---
## SPEAKER:
A marmot?
Oh no, poor marmot.
---
## SPEAKER:
Poor little guy.
---
[laughter]
---
## SPEAKER:
No, I do not like her.
---
[laughs]
---
## SPEAKER:
Sorry, we're in a temple.
## SPEAKER:
Oh, this is holy talk.
---
So interesting.
---
I actually had an unpleasant experience
with her right before I came here.
---
## SPEAKER:
Ah.
---
## SPEAKER:
Before that I had another
unpleasant experience with a Citizen of Y.
---
I think that's why snapped
at you about the shoes.
---
## SPEAKER:
I see. Yes, we suck.
---
## SPEAKER:
You're one of the good ones,
right?
---
## SPEAKER:
I try.
---
## SPEAKER:
How do you like Country X so far?
---
## SPEAKER:
Well, I just got here
so still feeling my way.
---
I've been here before.
---
Briefly, I visited the caves.
---
## SPEAKER:
The caves.
## SPEAKER:
Yes.
---
## SPEAKER:
Did you like them?
## SPEAKER:
It was quite an experience.
---
## SPEAKER:
They can be overwhelming
to some people.
---
Sorry, I didn't mean to say
that you were overwhelmed.
---
## SPEAKER:
No, I was actually.
---
## SPEAKER:
Really?
## SPEAKER:
Yes.
---
At the risk of sounding like a Country Y
seeker or something,
---
they changed my life.
---
## SPEAKER:
The experience of being
in the caves changes many people,
---
even Country X-ers.
---
Some people experience truth in ways
they can't describe.
---
Some people even see
and hear things down up there.
---
## SPEAKER:
I want to go back.
## SPEAKER:
Really?
---
## SPEAKER:
Yes.
---
## SPEAKER:
How about I take you?
---
## SPEAKER:
Would you?
---
## SPEAKER:
How about Sunday?
---
It's my day off.
---
[music]
---
## SPEAKER:
In truth,
---
one of the reasons I chose to come back
to Country X
---
was my experience in the caves.
---
From a distance, they're hard to see.
---
It's this chaotic network of nooks
and crannies spread across the hillside.
---
They look just like a shadow
between two blocks,
---
but step closer and go inside.
---
That is when you see
there's a whole universe within.
---
I venture inside one.
---
Other visitors are close behind.
---
We keep walking until we come to a place
with no more light and then we just stop.
---
We're standing there together,
complete strangers in total darkness.
---
We've gone silent.
---
We can hear each other's breath.
---
We can hear each other's heart beating.
---
You'll have to trust me when I say this,
we can hear each other's thoughts.
---
The darkness lets us do this.
---
We have become one mind
and we're thinking with our one mind,
---
"Isn't this something?" [laughs]
---
Don't be scared.
---
We're still in my living room.
---
Believe it or not, I know this looks
like a human like H's assistant,
---
but this is actually a mosquito.
---
[laughter]
---
## SPEAKER:
This is going to sound strange,
---
but I've been seeing things
differently here.
---
Upon my return to Country X,
---
things take on different forms and--
---
Mosquito: I can talk too.
## SPEAKER:
You can.
---
Mosquito: Yes.
---
## SPEAKER:
Why talk to me?
---
Mosquito: Why talk to me?
---
## SPEAKER:
Why not?
---
Mosquito: People normally want to kill me.
---
You didn't.
---
You saw me resting my weary wings
on a coat hook
---
and said, "Pretty thing."
---
## SPEAKER:
I thought you mistook coat hook
for a tree branch.
---
Mosquito: I mistook nothing.
---
I found a place to rest and so I did.
---
I'm I only allowed to rest
on what you call a tree?
---
## SPEAKER:
Of course not.
---
Mosquito: This is not your house.
---
The jungle doesn't understand the law.
---
## SPEAKER:
Mosquito?
Mosquito: Yes?
---
## SPEAKER:
I feel bad.
---
In the temple the other day, I made
mean comments about another person.
---
Mosquito: Oh, the head doctor.
---
## SPEAKER:
Yes.
Mosquito: What if she is mean to others?
---
## SPEAKER:
I don't want to be a person
who speaks ill of others.
---
Mosquito: But it opened
a door of friendship.
---
## SPEAKER:
There's got to be another way.
Mosquito: Or is kindness a luxury.
---
## SPEAKER:
Are you just being contrarian?
Mosquito: No.
---
## SPEAKER:
Mosquito.
Mosquito: Yes?
---
## SPEAKER:
Have I come to the right place
for this last leg of my journey?
---
Mosquito: Shall I give a cryptic answer
or let the question sit?
---
[music]
---
## SPEAKER:
Tomorrow night do expect
my friend J.
---
## SPEAKER:
J?
---
## SPEAKER:
I told you about her.
Security liaison?
---
## SPEAKER:
Right, security liaison.
---
What does that mean?
---
## SPEAKER:
Glorified security guard.
---
## SPEAKER:
Executive in charge
of teenage maintenance at the mall.
---
## SPEAKER:
Chief executive.
---
Actually to be honest, she probably
has more power than the title suggests.
---
## SPEAKER:
Is she like police?
## SPEAKER:
I guess so.
---
Country X still has a police force,
but we, Country Y, has a presence.
---
## SPEAKER:
Sounds insidious.
---
## SPEAKER:
It's complicated.
---
So glad you're finally here.
---
## SPEAKER:
Yes, I'm loving it.
---
It feels, I don't know,
alive here or something.
---
## SPEAKER:
The energy, right?
## SPEAKER:
Yes.
---
## SPEAKER:
I felt the same way
when I first got here.
---
## SPEAKER:
It's weird. It's like everyone
here seems to be living,
---
actually living.
Does that make sense?
---
Country Y comparison,
---
it's just so clear
how much they were not living.
---
They were just sleepwalking consumed
by these meaningless distractions,
---
but then here it's like--
---
## SPEAKER:
It's all about survival here,
right?
---
Well, not surviving. Living, living.
## SPEAKER:
Living.
---
## SPEAKER:
Got it.
---
I'm so glad you're finally living
with me in this living place.
---
## SPEAKER:
Yes.
---
Hey, I met this man on the boat ride
over here
---
and he had this really adventurous spirit.
---
We agreed to explore Country X together.
---
## SPEAKER:
I was going to do
that stuff with you too.
---
## SPEAKER:
During the days while
you're at work.
---
Do you have any friends
who are local or native?
---
## SPEAKER:
Native?
---
Like some native specimens
you can observe?
---
## SPEAKER:
You know what I mean.
Country X born.
---
## SPEAKER:
Most of the locals
are native born I think.
---
## SPEAKER:
Why were you being mean just now?
---
## SPEAKER:
That was mean?
## SPEAKER:
Observe the native specimens?
---
## SPEAKER:
I was kidding.
---
I'm sorry.
## SPEAKER:
Yes, you better watch yourself.
---
## SPEAKER:
You want to go
where the locals go, is that it?
---
## SPEAKER:
If it's not too much to ask.
## SPEAKER:
Like food places and clubs?
---
## SPEAKER:
Sure.
---
## SPEAKER:
Yes.
I'll take you to those places.
---
## SPEAKER:
Great.
Thank you.
---
## SPEAKER:
Although to be honest,
they're not all that different
---
from the more mainstream places
that's been there for a while.
---
## SPEAKER:
Mainstream places?
---
## SPEAKER:
Like last night. Café X,
it's pretty good Country X food, right?
---
## SPEAKER:
Sure, of course.
## SPEAKER:
The place is Country Y owned.
---
The food is authentic, the-- [crosstalk]
---
## SPEAKER:
But we will go to the down
and dirty local places
---
and get that authentic feel.
---
## SPEAKER:
Then come crawling back
to more mainstream places.
---
## SPEAKER:
Yes, that's right.
---
## SPEAKER:
That's weird to say.
---
Mainstream?
---
## SPEAKER:
You're getting all PC on me?
---
I think you'll find the longer
you're here,
---
the more that stuff
will just seem meaningless.
---
## SPEAKER:
No, I don't know.
---
## SPEAKER:
Well, like what we were saying
before about how it feels
---
so real here, right?
---
After a while all this PC stuff, it starts
to sound like a bunch of word games.
---
In Country Y, we would talk
and talk and talk about it.
---
Here, we're actually living it.
---
Does that make sense?
---
## SPEAKER:
Yes, but I guess maybe
that's why it would be good
---
to be even more vigilant, right?
---
If you're inside of it.
## SPEAKER:
No. What I'm saying is--
---
Mainstream, more mainstream.
## SPEAKER:
Mainstream
---
for who is all I am saying.
## SPEAKER:
Yes. Mainstream for us
---
is all I'm saying.
## SPEAKER:
We aren't even in Country Y,
---
which is what I was saying.
## SPEAKER:
We are Country Y citizens,
---
so it would be mainstream to us
is all I was-- [chuckles]
---
I'm not going to have to walk
on eggshells all the time, am I?
---
## SPEAKER:
Not if you say the right things.
---
[laughter]
---
## SPEAKER:
Okay.
---
I feel you've been a little--
## SPEAKER:
Go on.
---
## SPEAKER:
I just feel like
there's this judgment in your voice
---
sometimes since you got here.
---
## SPEAKER:
I'm judgmental.
---
Please say more.
---
## SPEAKER:
Maybe you have
these expectations or something
---
about how life in Country X should be.
---
When I don't make that happen,
you get a little--
---
## SPEAKER:
A little judgy?
---
I don't have expectations, but okay,
---
maybe this past week
because it's just been staying home,
---
going on Country Y clubhouse,
going to a bar.
---
[crosstalk] ## SPEAKER:
You just got here.
## SPEAKER:
I know, so I'm explaining.
---
Maybe I've been a little restless.
---
## SPEAKER:
I think maybe we're just finding
our language together.
---
## SPEAKER:
I think so too.
---
## SPEAKER:
Are we cool?
---
Can we be cool?
## SPEAKER:
Yes, we can be.
---
We can be cool.
---
Hey, one of the thing my new friend
wants is to just go to the caves.
---
## SPEAKER:
The caves?
## SPEAKER:
Yes, have you been?
---
## SPEAKER:
No, not yet,
but I've heard they're a little--
---
## SPEAKER:
What?
---
## SPEAKER:
Never mind.
## SPEAKER:
What?
---
## SPEAKER:
[laughs]
I've heard they're a little overhyped,
---
but I'm sure they're great.
---
## SPEAKER:
Okay,
so you think I'm judgmental,
---
but I think you've become weird
and jaded.
---
## SPEAKER:
Oh, really?
## SPEAKER:
Yes, about Country X.
---
It's not like you.
---
## SPEAKER:
Well, I guess you do get more
in tune with your home country out here.
---
Start to put up some boundaries,
but I will try to act less jaded.
---
Hey, I want you to be careful out there.
Caves?
---
## SPEAKER:
Why?
---
## SPEAKER:
It's the wilderness out there,
the actual wilderness of wild animals.
---
## SPEAKER:
Oh, yes?
## SPEAKER:
Yes.
---
People have been killed
so you need protection.
---
## SPEAKER:
I'll be careful.
## SPEAKER:
Thank you.
---
## SPEAKER:
You've changed a little bit.
---
## SPEAKER:
Welcome to Country X.
---
[music]
---
## SPEAKER:
J knows all the places.
She's been here a while.
---
## SPEAKER:
I know, yes.
---
Actually, it's our official suggestion
right now
---
that Country Y citizens
avoid local Country X establishments
---
at least for the next few weeks.
---
## SPEAKER:
How come?
## SPEAKER:
Tensions, tensions lately.
---
## SPEAKER:
Were you going to tell me
about that?
---
## SPEAKER:
It's normal.
That's how it goes here.
---
Things lights up then they'll settle down.
---
It comes in waves.
## SPEAKER:
What happened?
---
## SPEAKER:
A local boy imprisoned
for a theft.
---
He stole.
## SPEAKER:
What did he steal?
---
## SPEAKER:
The law is clear,
you steal you go to jail.
---
## SPEAKER:
Yes, but what did he steal?
## SPEAKER:
It doesn't matter, right?
---
That's what you're saying.
The law is the law.
---
## SPEAKER:
Hey, I'm just asking.
---
## SPEAKER:
Batteries.
---
He stole batteries.
---
Harsh, right?
---
Going to jail for batteries.
---
What are they doing over there locking up
locals over batteries?
---
## SPEAKER:
Yes. What are you doing?
---
## SPEAKER:
What are we doing in Country X?
---
Oh, that's a good question,
---
but no, it is.
---
I've read the articles.
---
I know what some people
are saying back home,
---
but guess what?
That question, not my problem.
---
The only question I'm responsible for
is are we going to enforce the law
---
or not? Guess what?
---
It's their law.
You steal, you go to jail.
---
That's on their books.
---
## SPEAKER:
Yes, but it's how you choose
to enforce the law, right?
---
## SPEAKER:
We enforce the law equally
or strictly by the books.
---
## SPEAKER:
It's their law and their books.
## SPEAKER:
Their laws. Yes,
---
their laws, their governments,
---
their courts.
## SPEAKER:
Courts.
---
## SPEAKER:
We're playing by their rules.
---
## SPEAKER:
Playing by the rules
so you can take advantage of them, right?
---
## SPEAKER:
[laughs] What is that?
## SPEAKER:
Take advantage?
---
My God, we're taking advantage.
## SPEAKER:
I don't mean you personally
---
take advantage or you.
## SPEAKER:
That's just saying, right?
---
## SPEAKER:
What?
## SPEAKER:
That it's us personally.
---
## SPEAKER:
No, I didn't.
## SPEAKER:
We are Country Y.
---
## SPEAKER:
Yes, I know.
## SPEAKER:
Look, it's a globalized world.
---
If you engage with another country
through legitimate means,
---
that's legitimate.
## SPEAKER:
Yes,
---
but that's using the guise of legitimacy
to pretty much usurp the country.
---
## SPEAKER:
Guise of legitimacy?
It's legitimate or illegitimate.
---
Well, their president is in power.
## SPEAKER:
Well--
---
## SPEAKER:
Well what?
---
## SPEAKER:
President K?
---
Come on.
---
## SPEAKER:
What's wrong with President K?
## SPEAKER:
Are you serious?
---
## SPEAKER:
Yes, what's wrong with him?
## SPEAKER:
He's a puppet, right?
---
Of ours.
---
## SPEAKER:
Look, you don't know
what you're talking about.
---
## SPEAKER:
Excuse me?
## SPEAKER:
Well, you don't.
---
You don't. I mean, we all used
to read about all the terrible things
---
that Country Y is doing to Country X.
---
When you're here, it's just not true.
---
You can't pass judgment.
---
## SPEAKER:
That's not passing judgment.
## SPEAKER:
You're passing judgment
---
on her job on her livelihood-
## SPEAKER:
It's okay.
---
## SPEAKER:
Mine too. No, it's not okay.
Look, I apologize to you on her behalf.
---
## SPEAKER:
Don't apologize for me.
---
## SPEAKER:
What you're saying is not valid.
---
It's just embarrassing.
---
## SPEAKER:
How dare you?
---
## SPEAKER:
It's like you two are going to be
married or something.
---
[background noise]
---
## SPEAKER:
Hey.
## SPEAKER:
I'm sorry.
---
## SPEAKER:
No.
## SPEAKER:
I'm sorry.
---
[crosstalk]
## SPEAKER:
No.
---
## SPEAKER:
What do you want me to say?
---
## SPEAKER:
You're-- You are--
## SPEAKER:
What?
---
## SPEAKER:
You're a completely
different person.
---
## SPEAKER:
I'm not a completely
different person.
---
## SPEAKER:
No, you are.
You are.
---
You would've never said
those things to me back at home.
---
You're a completely different person.
## SPEAKER:
I'm the same person I always was.
---
Hate to break it to you.
---
## SPEAKER:
Well then I guess
I'm very confused.
---
[foot steps]
---
[background noise]
---
## SPEAKER:
I actually lived in Country T
for a few years when I was young.
---
## SPEAKER:
No kidding.
## SPEAKER:
From Five to eight.
---
## SPEAKER:
Why so short?
## SPEAKER:
I was a military brat.
---
Moved a lot within Country Y too.
---
## SPEAKER:
Military brat.
---
Why do they call it brat?
---
## SPEAKER:
Maybe we tend to be brats,
---
never staying in one place for long,
so we act out.
---
## SPEAKER:
[laughs] You were a bratty kid?
---
## SPEAKER:
No, the opposite.
Very timid, sickly, too.
---
Timid and sickly.
We were always moving.
---
## SPEAKER:
Right from the [?]
---
## SPEAKER:
You were born in Country X?
---
## SPEAKER:
Born, raised, residing.
---
## SPEAKER:
Ah.
## SPEAKER:
Yes.
---
## SPEAKER:
My home-
## SPEAKER:
Being overrun with carpetbaggers,
---
like me must be very hard.
---
## SPEAKER:
That's what you say.
---
[laughs]
## SPEAKER:
Huh?
---
Who? Who said?
## SPEAKER:
No.
---
No never mind.
It's a childish Country X [crosstalk]
---
## SPEAKER:
Yes, I think I get it too.
---
[laughter]
---
## SPEAKER:
I took a risk to push
the familiarity to the next level.
---
## SPEAKER:
Okay.
We're officially at the next level.
---
## SPEAKER:
No turning back now.
---
## SPEAKER:
Are they talking in there?
## SPEAKER:
Uh, professor,
---
I didn't hear you come in.
---
## SPEAKER:
Why are you here?
Is H coming too?
---
## SPEAKER:
No, he is not.
I'm on my own.
---
Driving unto to the caves?
---
You're going too?
## SPEAKER:
I was invited, but I'll stay.
---
## SPEAKER:
Do you want to go in there?
## SPEAKER:
Oh, let them talk for a bit.
---
Is the rest of the party here?
## SPEAKER:
Not yet.
---
## SPEAKER:
What are they talking about?
---
## SPEAKER:
Oh, I wasn't eavesdropping.
## SPEAKER:
Of course not.
---
## SPEAKER:
They were joking
about something women say.
---
Didn't get the reference.
---
## SPEAKER:
Sometimes you can get things
without getting every reference.
---
[laughter]
---
## SPEAKER:
They're getting along
great. ## SPEAKER:
You're right about that.
---
## SPEAKER:
What?
---
## SPEAKER:
Do you see what B's doing?
---
She opens her arms and then keeps
holding them back together.
---
## SPEAKER:
Yes.
## SPEAKER:
There's a struggle there.
---
## SPEAKER:
What do you mean?
---
## SPEAKER:
B wants to share everything
with F,
---
but still doesn't know
how much she can reveal.
---
## SPEAKER:
Huh?
---
## SPEAKER:
You just blew my mind.
---
## SPEAKER:
Glad to hear it.
---
## SPEAKER:
That's a totally
different perspective.
---
## SPEAKER:
He's flattering her.
Over flattering.
---
## SPEAKER:
He sees that. He's backtracking.
---
## SPEAKER:
I mean, did your research
take a long time?
---
## SPEAKER:
Perspective was the problem.
---
## SPEAKER:
Possibly condescending
so he's been enforcing the science.
---
## SPEAKER:
You're good.
## SPEAKER:
I got classes.
---
## SPEAKER:
Tell me, are you married?
---
## SPEAKER:
Whoa.
Hello.
---
## SPEAKER:
Okay,
it's from platonic intimacy,
---
I think.
## SPEAKER:
Oh, no. No.
---
## SPEAKER:
You're such a catch.
## SPEAKER:
I think.
---
## SPEAKER:
Well, there are a lot
of attractive Country Y citizens here.
---
## SPEAKER:
To be honest, I don't really fit
in with them.
---
## SPEAKER:
You don't fit in
with your own people?
---
## SPEAKER:
Yes.
---
## SPEAKER:
You seem likable enough.
---
## SPEAKER:
Oh, [laughs] thank you.
---
I don't know. I think I get
along better with Country Xs.
---
## SPEAKER:
B looked down.
She bristled.
---
## SPEAKER:
Yes, so.
---
## SPEAKER:
Maybe she thinks F
has a Country X finish.
---
## SPEAKER:
What I mean is there's something
really unfinished
---
about Country Y citizens in this country.
---
You should be comfortable and complete
before you give yourself to another.
---
## SPEAKER:
You're a Country Y citizen in X.
---
Are you an unfinished person?
---
## SPEAKER:
Huh?
## SPEAKER:
Got him there.
---
## SPEAKER:
You're right,
so I'm not catchy either.
---
## SPEAKER:
Oh, you'd bring something
to the table.
---
You'd feel a deficit
of your own country's making.
---
## SPEAKER:
What do you mean?
---
## SPEAKER:
Being under the control
of Country Y makes us feel incomplete.
---
Being suddenly consider this offshoot
of something greater.
---
## SPEAKER:
Ah.
---
## SPEAKER:
You do a great service
to a Country X by marrying them,
---
filling a Country Y shape.
---
## SPEAKER:
How's he going
to get out of this one?
---
## SPEAKER:
Was it a trap?
---
## SPEAKER:
F's confused.
---
He doesn't know if it's irony or not.
---
If it's irony, tinged with truth.
---
How far down does the hostility go?
---
Is there an intention to relate
this hostility to him?
---
Then how conscious is this intention?
How far down does that go?
---
## SPEAKER:
Yes, that's what I was thinking.
---
I was married once, but they don't.
---
## SPEAKER:
Sorry to hear that.
---
## SPEAKER:
This is V.
---
## SPEAKER:
V is beautiful.
---
## SPEAKER:
V died two years ago.
---
They were my life.
---
Since then I found it difficult
to connect to people.
---
I have friends.
---
Yes, but there's a spirit we had
and this kind of language
---
we shared on some level,
we all speak the same language,
---
but in practice-
## SPEAKER:
Hard to Find.
---
## SPEAKER:
Yes, but then you--
You seem to really listen.
---
You seem to care.
---
## SPEAKER:
I do care.
---
## SPEAKER:
What do you think G?
---
Does he really care about B
or he's a wishful thinker?
---
## SPEAKER:
Do you know B
to be a good judge of people?
---
## SPEAKER:
She is sometimes blinded
by people's [?]
---
## SPEAKER:
Sometimes it's good to give
passion the benefit of the doubt.
---
What about F?
---
## SPEAKER:
I think he's a little lost.
---
He doesn't fit in with his own people.
---
Not a Country X either.
## SPEAKER:
Where is he to go?
---
What if he just wants to disappear?
---
## SPEAKER:
He can disappear.
---
No sorry.
We'll see you.
---
## SPEAKER:
You have feelings about F.
---
## SPEAKER:
I shouldn't be so forthcoming
with my opinions
---
## SPEAKER:
Forth come where?
---
## SPEAKER:
Okay.
---
Well,
---
He has no right to be here.
---
All of them.
---
This is our country.
---
Even if he just drifted here
in search of adventure or work.
---
If you come here in search of work,
guess what?
---
You're taking one of our jobs.
---
You can't be a mutual entity.
---
He has no right to be here.
---
## SPEAKER:
His responsibility is to leave?
---
## SPEAKER:
Yes.
---
## SPEAKER:
What if I said he has no to go
home to or everywhere to go home to?
---
What if the world is his home?
---
## SPEAKER:
That's fluffy.
[laughs] Fluffy.
---
[knocks]
---
## SPEAKER:
Oh, there's Q.
That's the group.
---
Should I announce you?
---
G?
---
## SPEAKER:
Q.
## SPEAKER:
Hey.
---
## SPEAKER:
This is B.
B, Q.
---
Oh, BBQ.
---
## SPEAKER:
You look familiar.
---
## SPEAKER:
Do I look?
---
## SPEAKER:
You look kind of familiar too.
---
Thanks so much for coordinating this trip.
---
## SPEAKER:
Oh, it's my pleasure.
---
## SPEAKER:
I can see them
in my mind's eye from above.
---
They move like tiny insects along
an imperceptible trail,
---
across imperceptible elevations.
---
They move almost blind
towards imperceptible holes
---
in the earth whereupon entering
there will be made even blinder.
---
[bird chirps]
## SPEAKER:
They seek [?] a sound.
---
As if they do not like the way
things look.
---
They want to see it new?
---
## SPEAKER:
No, I'm sorry.
I'm just suddenly not feeling so good.
---
## SPEAKER:
What's wrong?
## SPEAKER:
What are you feeling?
---
## SPEAKER:
Migraine, I think. I'll be fine.
I just need to sit down.
---
## SPEAKER:
Should we go around?
## SPEAKER:
Let's go back.
---
## SPEAKER:
No, I'll be fine.
You two go ahead.
---
## SPEAKER:
We can come back another day.
---
We need to get you back home.
## SPEAKER:
This is what I want.
---
Please.
---
I'll wait for you right here.
---
[background noise]
---
## SPEAKER:
The air so lovely.
---
## SPEAKER:
Yes it is.
---
[?]
---
I heard there're wild animals here.
---
## SPEAKER:
Near the caves?
## SPEAKER:
Like what kinds?
---
## SPEAKER:
You don't have anything to ask?
---
Everywhere is wild animals,
trails [?] not lions and bears,
---
but you never actually encounter them.
---
## SPEAKER:
I think there's supposed
to be wild boars here.
---
## SPEAKER:
Wild boars?
## SPEAKER:
Yes.
---
## SPEAKER:
That's it?
## SPEAKER:
From what I've heard.
---
How are you?
[crosstalk] ## SPEAKER:
Send me a doctor.
---
Oh, please.
## SPEAKER:
No, please.
---
## SPEAKER:
No, please, I insist.
---
## SPEAKER:
I was just going to ask
how you were enjoying country x so far.
---
## SPEAKER:
Oh, yes, I'm loving it.
---
Yes, it's very new
and different for me here.
---
What I find really interesting
is that it's not automatically
---
welcoming here, which is a good thing.
## SPEAKER:
Okay.
---
## SPEAKER:
Just there's a sense
of this place is yours,
---
like really yours
and there's a pride in that.
---
You're not trying to please anyone.
Does that make sense?
---
## SPEAKER:
I like to think
we're naturally friendly.
---
## SPEAKER:
Oh, no, you are. You are.
Oh, God. I'm not saying this right.
---
## SPEAKER:
I understand.
---
## SPEAKER:
It's just different
from the stereotypes,
---
which is a good thing.
---
## SPEAKER:
What are the stereotypes?
---
## SPEAKER:
Oh, you know
that there's an accommodating nature
---
maybe, which isn't true.
---
It is true.
You're accommodating,
---
but not overly accommodating
is what I meant.
---
## SPEAKER:
How long have you known [?]?
---
## SPEAKER:
Oh, not that long.
Just the boat ride over.
---
You?
## SPEAKER:
Just met him.
---
## SPEAKER:
He's very friendly.
## SPEAKER:
Yes, he is.
---
## SPEAKER:
Hey, I'm sorry if--
---
I didn't mean anything or anything bad
about being welcoming
---
or not welcoming? [crosstalk]
## SPEAKER:
Don't worry about it.
---
## SPEAKER:
I know I sound like a fool.
---
I'm just going through
some things right now, I think.
---
I had a fight with my fiancé, so.
---
He's really changed up.
Here's the thing, so I feel a bit lonely,
---
I guess, to be perfectly honest with you.
---
I think that's why
I wasn't saying things right.
---
My social skills are a bit
and I'm rambling now.
---
I'm going on and I'm not making any sense.
---
## SPEAKER:
Don't worry about it.
---
I'm not judging you.
---
## SPEAKER:
This isn't who I am.
---
I'm just going through some things.
---
## SPEAKER:
We're here.
---
Oh, this is it. This is it.
---
I want you to go in first.
---
## SPEAKER:
Oh, no,
I don't want to leave you behind.
---
## SPEAKER:
You said you were going
through some things.
---
Well, the caves are a place
to confront things,
---
find answers,
but you'll have to go in alone.
---
I'll wait out here for a bit.
---
Smoke a cigarette and then join you.
---
## SPEAKER:
Okay, then.
---
Thank you.
---
## SPEAKER:
Hello.
---
Hello.
---
Who's there?
---
Who, who's there?
---
Oh, it's you.
---
[music]
---
## SPEAKER:
We're going to just take
a breath here.
---
We'll pause for one minute.
---
How are you doing?
---
How's it going so far?
Good.
---
Each of you is seeing this story
in slightly different ways depending
---
on your experience, even the experience
of what books you might have read.
---
Like this story tonight,
some of you will recognize
---
as a kind of remix of E.M.
Forster's A Passage to India.
---
If you haven't read it, that's fine.
---
If you have read it,
you should let that go too.
---
I think the author himself would say
that this isn't his story but our story.
---
By ours, I mean everyone here
in this room right now.
---
I'm trying to bring us
all to the same page,
---
even though that's impossible, right?
---
[music]
---
## SPEAKER:
There's no physical evidence--
## SPEAKER:
No.
---
## SPEAKER:
-- that she should be released.
If there's no evidence,
---
they can't hold her.
---
Simple as that, so unbelievable.
---
## SPEAKER:
It's not unbelievable.
## SPEAKER:
Right, you're always right,
---
but the real travesty is B
is innocent until proven guilty.
---
In the eyes of the law,
she still didn't do anything, right?
---
Look what was done.
What is provable,
---
this country-wide psychopath who brings
a gun on a hike and actually shoots it.
---
## SPEAKER:
I know.
---
## SPEAKER:
So there is evidence
for that crime.
---
It wouldn't be actually accused of a vague
assault charge, no specifics.
---
Yet she's still locked up on this country
wire who actually attempted murder.
---
That actually happened.
## SPEAKER:
Yes, she walks free.
---
## SPEAKER:
Walks free?
---
How can they be so blatant?
---
That's my question.
---
## SPEAKER:
Of course, I know.
Who are you talking to here?
---
## SPEAKER:
Do they think we won't take
action against this?
---
## SPEAKER:
It's already happening.
---
The battery protesters
have taken out these claws.
---
It's escalating fast.
## SPEAKER:
Good. That's good.
---
I'm just so mad right now.
I'm so mad.
---
## SPEAKER:
What if she did it?
## SPEAKER:
Excuse me?
---
## SPEAKER:
What if B actually did something
in the shooting in self-defense?
---
## SPEAKER:
What?
This is B we're talking about,
---
one of the most gentle souls
on the planet.
---
## SPEAKER:
What if she wasn't gentle?
## SPEAKER:
What are you doing?
---
## SPEAKER:
This is how it's going
to look when it's brought to trial.
---
First, they'll show that B
isn't a gentle soul because she's not.
---
She's a human being
with flaws just like the next person.
---
The burden on an accused country
ex-citizen is to be a spotless angel,
---
an impossible standard.
---
Once that's undermined,
then they win the case.
---
This is how it works
so we need to be prepared.
---
## SPEAKER:
Do you think she did something?
---
## SPEAKER:
Of course, not.
This is B we're talking about.
---
## SPEAKER:
We need to secure
a calendar charged on her behalf
---
for attempted murder.
Let's come to this full force.
---
That's it.
---
I'm getting out of business with them.
---
## SPEAKER:
The country wire.
---
It's good to have you back.
---
## SPEAKER:
Start making calls.
---
[crowd chanting]
---
## SPEAKER:
Where's Kim?
## SPEAKER:
At our place.
---
## SPEAKER:
Good.
---
## SPEAKER:
She hasn't left the house
once since.
---
## SPEAKER:
She's needs to stay there.
---
It's not safe in the streets
for her with this protest.
---
Riots are getting out of hand.
---
It's vandalism and barbarism now,
---
and people at home wonder
why we're so severe.
---
## SPEAKER:
What about these attempted murder
charges against Kim?
---
Are they serious?
## SPEAKER:
No they're not.
---
## SPEAKER:
Are you sure?
---
## SPEAKER:
It's posturing a desperate
attempt to change the story.
---
Let me worry about it.
I'll make sure it doesn't go anywhere.
---
I know people.
## SPEAKER:
Thanks.
---
## SPEAKER:
She's brave.
[?] defended herself like that.
---
How's she doing?
---
## SPEAKER:
She's just a little--
## SPEAKER:
Scared?
---
## SPEAKER:
More than that really down
like despondent or something.
---
## SPEAKER:
Well, after everything
she's been through.
---
## SPEAKER:
She won't talk about it.
## SPEAKER:
Well, yes, the drama.
---
## SPEAKER:
She's never really told me
what happened, the story.
---
## SPEAKER:
But the police
before you read that.
---
## SPEAKER:
Yes.
---
## SPEAKER:
She told the story once.
She didn't want to do it again.
---
What's the problem?
## SPEAKER:
I don't know.
---
Something feels weird.
---
## SPEAKER:
Weird.
---
How?
---
Is she talking at all?
## SPEAKER:
No.
---
## SPEAKER:
Don't let her talk
to anyone else.
---
## SPEAKER:
Why not?
## SPEAKER:
We're building a case for her.
---
She's acting weird and despondent
and she's unreliable in any way.
---
## SPEAKER:
Thanks again
for everything that you're doing.
---
## SPEAKER:
We're all behind her.
---
We stick together.
---
[music]
---
## SPEAKER:
I insist we go ahead,
so I do on his wish.
---
Kim and I walk together,
and all the way there,
---
she keeps on this mindless bubble
just on and on and on until she says--
---
she actually says, get this,
---
she says she's surprised
how unfriendly country x is.
---
## SPEAKER:
What?
## SPEAKER:
She said,
---
"I expected you to be more accommodating."
## SPEAKER:
I'd insult her too.
---
## SPEAKER:
[?], what do you mean by that?
---
## SPEAKER:
Who knows?
We're not tourist-friendly?
---
## SPEAKER:
So what happens next?
---
## SPEAKER:
I tell her to go
into the caves alone,
---
that it'd be more mystical
for her that way.
---
She seems scared at first
but then goes in.
---
I smoke a cigarette, enjoy the air,
and then I hear a scream,
---
her scream so I rush in.
I'm fumbling for my lighter.
---
I can't see anything and I'm calling out
her name the whole time,
---
asking if she's okay
and then I reach out and touch her.
---
When I touch her,
she grabs me and pushes me back
---
really hard and I fall to the ground
and I'm like, "What the fuck?"
---
Then she shoots at me.
---
She shoots at me and it's the loudest
explosion I've ever heard.
---
I feel a bullet.
---
The wind from the fucking bully going
right past my head at point-blank range
---
and it's confusion.
I'm like,
---
"Is there someone else here
because she can't be shooting at me?
---
Where did she even get the gun?"
Then I hear her scrambling
---
and she's rushing past me out the cave.
---
When I get outside, she's gone.
---
I have no idea where she is
and I'm like, "What just happened?"
---
Then I make my way back to F,
we decide to head back
---
and S was there with the car but no,
---
there's a police car waiting
and then I should have never gone.
---
How stupid of me.
---
Has she been arrested yet?
---
## SPEAKER:
No.
## SPEAKER:
Why the fuck not?
---
## SPEAKER:
We're working on it.
## SPEAKER:
It's not fair.
---
## SPEAKER:
We know.
[alarm]
---
## SPEAKER:
I am fully on your side
now about countrywide.
---
## SPEAKER:
We all are.
## SPEAKER:
We all stand beside you.
---
[music]
[crowd chants]
---
## SPEAKER:
Hello.
## SPEAKER:
Hello.
---
## SPEAKER:
You look like a man but I know
you're really a gecko
---
crawling along my wall.
---
## SPEAKER:
Gecko, along your wall.
---
## SPEAKER:
Can you see me?
---
## SPEAKER:
I see you.
---
## SPEAKER:
There was something else
that happened in those caves,
---
long ago standing with those strangers.
## SPEAKER:
Strangers.
---
## SPEAKER:
Something I try to forget.
---
After standing there together
and feeling communion,
---
someone decides to call out, hear echo.
---
## SPEAKER:
Echo.
---
## SPEAKER:
It's a little girl.
---
She calls out, "Hello."
---
Everyone expects to hear her voice
echo back but instead,
---
all we hear is this muscle boom sound.
---
[boom]
---
## SPEAKER:
She tries again, same thing.
---
"Hello." [boom]
---
## SPEAKER:
Others try.
I try too.
---
"Hello." [boom]
---
## SPEAKER:
Suddenly everyone is doing it.
---
It becomes this mass panic, trying
to hear echoes that don't come back.
---
[boom]
---
## SPEAKER:
What's happening?
---
What's going on?
[boom]
---
## SPEAKER:
No matter what we say,
---
how we say it, no matter who says what,
it all comes back the same-
---
[boom]
---
## SPEAKER:
-And I was afraid.
---
I did not want to lose my voice.
---
That is who I am.
---
I'll be honest, little gecko.
---
The other day I was actually afraid
to run to the caves.
---
It wasn't a migraine.
---
When we were almost there, fear,
---
a panic gripped me
and I couldn't go on and now.
---
## SPEAKER:
And now, and now.
---
## SPEAKER:
How do we move forward?
---
What are we to do?
---
## SPEAKER:
What are we?
What are we?
---
Indeed.
---
[Music]
---
## SPEAKER:
You don't believe me.
---
## SPEAKER:
I don't know.
## SPEAKER:
You can say it if you don't.
---
Why not be honest?
## SPEAKER:
Okay, I don't.
---
## SPEAKER:
Good.
---
It's better.
---
That's why you waited so long to see me,
right?
---
I'm sorry.
---
I haven't seen anyone in a while.
---
Please don't go.
## SPEAKER:
I'm not going.
---
## SPEAKER:
I need someone on my side.
## SPEAKER:
I'm not on your side.
---
## SPEAKER:
Why don't you believe me?
## SPEAKER:
I know B.
---
She wouldn't hurt anyone.
## SPEAKER:
Well, I'm sorry.
---
You can't feel what I went through.
It doesn't mean that it didn't happen.
---
## SPEAKER:
So what happened?
## SPEAKER:
So you can put my story apart?
---
## SPEAKER:
Why would I do that?
---
## SPEAKER:
That's what R's been doing,
needling me,
---
saying my story needs to be airtight.
---
He was the one who forced me
to bring the gun.
---
I didn't want to but we've just been
fighting all the time so I said,
---
"Okay, I won't fight you on this one.
I'll take it. Fine."
---
## SPEAKER:
What do you mean
your story needs to be airtight?
---
## SPEAKER:
I didn't want to leave you
when you were feeling sick.
---
## SPEAKER:
I know you didn't.
## SPEAKER:
But you seemed like you actually
---
preferred if we went
on so that's why I begged.
---
## SPEAKER:
I know.
I know that's what happened.
---
What happened next?
What really happened in those caves?
---
I should tell you.
---
The real reason I stayed behind
was that I was afraid.
---
## SPEAKER:
What were you afraid of?
---
## SPEAKER:
You experience things
in those caves.
---
I know you did
because I did too so I know.
---
Just tell me what happened.
---
## SPEAKER:
I'm walking down the trail
without you and during the walk,
---
B's very silent.
---
She seems distracted so I try to talk
to fill the space
---
because she seems uncomfortable
and I want to make her comfortable.
---
I start talking and the more I talk,
the more I feel we're drifting,
---
drifting apart.
Do you know that feeling?
---
## SPEAKER:
Yes, I do.
## SPEAKER:
Suddenly, a panic sets in
---
because it's clear now.
---
It's so clear that she doesn't want
to be here with me.
---
She'd rather be back with you.
---
She's not even hiding it
and before I know it,
---
I'm alone in the cave.
---
She's abandoned me like she's wanted to do
from the beginning.
---
She's made up some excuse.
---
I don't expect you'll ever join me
but then I realized I'm mistaken
---
because out of nowhere there she is.
---
## SPEAKER:
B?
---
## SPEAKER:
Yes, B.
## SPEAKER:
Are you sure?
---
## SPEAKER:
Yes.
## SPEAKER:
Are you sure that's what you saw?
---
## SPEAKER:
Yes, who else could it have been,
huh?
---
What other explanation could there be?
---
You hate me.
## SPEAKER:
No.
---
## SPEAKER:
I don't want you to hate me.
---
## SPEAKER:
Look at me.
Does it look like I hate you?
---
## SPEAKER:
It wasn't B that I saw.
---
I thought I was going crazy.
---
A person comes in and it's R, my fiancee.
---
That's who I think I see, R,
but how did he get here
---
and what's happening to me?
---
As I look at him, suddenly
my future, past,
---
and self start crumbling away
because it's clear now that this man,
---
this man that I staked my life
on isn't who I thought he was
---
and it's clear now that I'm really alone.
---
I've always been alone my whole life
---
and I call out to him
but he doesn't respond.
---
Something's not right.
His image wavers.
---
I call to him again
but he just stands there,
---
staring at me.
---
His eyes, they're different.
They're not his.
---
They're the eyes of an animal.
---
This isn't my fiance.
---
Even though it looks like him,
he's changing
---
before my eyes
and it's angry this creature,
---
and it moves towards me, and I scream,
I scream but it keeps up coming.
---
I think it's going to kill me.
---
This creature that I thought I knew.
---
I cried out for help and I made a mistake.
---
I made a terrible mistake.
---
[music]
---
## SPEAKER:
Cheers.
## SPEAKER:
Cheers.
---
## SPEAKER:
To justice, a kind of justice.
---
## SPEAKER:
A kind of justice, yes.
---
## SPEAKER:
How are you feeling?
---
## SPEAKER:
I am feeling a lot of things.
## SPEAKER:
I'm sure.
---
## SPEAKER:
I haven't been reinstated
at the hospital yet.
---
## SPEAKER:
Really?
How come? I didn't even know you were--
---
## SPEAKER:
I was put
on indefinite suspension.
---
Once the charges [?].
## SPEAKER:
But the charges were dropped.
---
## SPEAKER:
They said they need to do
some paperwork for the reinstatement
---
but it's been a while
and they won't return my calls.
---
## SPEAKER:
That's terrible.
---
You can't just go in there,
make a stand, say, "I belong here?"
---
## SPEAKER:
So I'm forced to make some
righteous stand in order
---
to return to my job on top
---
of everything else I've been through?
## SPEAKER:
No, you're right, you're right.
---
## SPEAKER:
Sorry, I didn't mean to sound--
## SPEAKER:
No, it's okay. It's okay.
---
## SPEAKER:
It's just irritating,
very irritating.
---
I really appreciate you visiting me
when I--
---
## SPEAKER:
That's what friends are for.
## SPEAKER:
Oh, you didn't have to.
---
## SPEAKER:
Yes, I did.
## SPEAKER:
To us.
---
[chuckles]
---
## SPEAKER:
I should tell you
I've been in touch with Q.
---
## SPEAKER:
Oh, yes.
---
What did she say?
## SPEAKER:
She's devastated but obviously,
---
it's not what you've been through
and I know,
---
I'm sure you're not in a position to--
## SPEAKER:
Forgive her?
---
## SPEAKER:
No, no.
---
Maybe I'm not sure what I'm trying to--
## SPEAKER:
It's no light switch,
---
not forgive, and forgive, you know?
---
## SPEAKER:
Yes, of course. Of course.
---
I don't even know why I brought her up.
I'm sorry.
---
## SPEAKER:
How is she though?
---
## SPEAKER:
You don't have to tell her.
## SPEAKER:
No, I'm curious.
---
It's fine.
---
## SPEAKER:
I think she's feeling really,
really isolated.
---
She said she's being shunned
by the country's [?] community
---
because of her backtracking.
---
I think they really wanted the conviction
to go through and her marriage is off now.
---
Her fiance left her.
## SPEAKER:
I would too if I were him.
---
You feel sympathy for her?
## SPEAKER:
Yes, I'm a softy.
---
It did take us to rehearsal stuff,
I'll give her that much, but.
---
## SPEAKER:
This woman dragged [?]
through the mud.
---
For me, to having suspect that such an act
casts a permanent shadow on her character.
---
## SPEAKER:
Of course, no.
---
You're right. You're still right.
I'm sorry.
---
I need to see the bigger picture.
---
Let's not talk about it anymore.
---
I'm really sorry if--
## SPEAKER:
You.
---
## SPEAKER:
What?
## SPEAKER:
You forget that she tried
---
to kill, right, did you?
---
## SPEAKER:
No, I didn't forget.
---
## SPEAKER:
But everything
we're talking about,
---
the conviction, my job and I'm her son.
She's going through and all that.
---
You forget.
---
## SPEAKER:
It wasn't on the top of my mind,
I'm sorry.
---
## SPEAKER:
Don't keep saying sorry.
## SPEAKER:
Okay.
---
## SPEAKER:
When that gun went up,
I thought my life was over.
---
## SPEAKER:
That should have
been at the top of my mind.
---
I am so sorry.
---
I shouldn't have forgotten
that your safety
---
is the most important thing.
---
I shouldn't forget, I can't forget that.
---
I can't forget that because--
## SPEAKER:
Because you're my friend.
---
That's what you shouldn't have forgotten.
---
## SPEAKER:
Right.
Exactly.
---
I feel like I'm not-- Should I go?
---
Do you want me to leave?
---
## SPEAKER:
I'm not sure.
---
Maybe.
---
## SPEAKER:
I just want to say that I'm,
okay, not sorry, but as a friend,
---
I feel awful that I didn't acknowledge
the true weight of the shooting,
---
we were talking just now
and I want to be here for you
---
in any way that I can if
and when you need me.
---
## SPEAKER:
I was a little triggered
when you brought her [?] and everything
---
that's happening to her.
---
I think maybe I just got this feeling
that you wanted me to drop the charges
---
against her and that that was maybe
why you came here.
---
## SPEAKER:
That couldn't be further
from the truth.
---
## SPEAKER:
I'm still going through
with the charges
---
even though she dropped her [?] charges.
## SPEAKER:
I know.
---
## SPEAKER:
Do you think I should?
---
## SPEAKER:
Drop your charges?
---
I don't think I can answer that.
---
## SPEAKER:
Why?
## SPEAKER:
Because I'm not in your shoes.
---
## SPEAKER:
Do you think
I should drop the charges?
---
You do, right?
---
You come here to try and see
if you could get me to drop
---
the charges against you?
## SPEAKER:
No.
---
You don't believe me?
---
## SPEAKER:
I know what you did.
---
I know you're the one who got her
to change her story.
---
I know I'm free now because of you.
---
You're my friend
and you're her friend too.
---
## SPEAKER:
No.
## SPEAKER:
It's okay.
---
You can have your own friends.
---
I guess I was just hurt because I thought
you came here to celebrate with me.
---
Be with me and that was all
and then suddenly I got this feeling
---
when we brought up Kulick
that you were actually here on a mission
---
to solve the other half
of some problem.
---
## SPEAKER:
You really don't think much
of me, do you?
---
## SPEAKER:
Am I wrong?
---
## SPEAKER:
Okay.
---
Do you want to the truth?
---
Fine.
---
If it felt right, I might have mentioned
the possibility of dropping your charges
---
but it didn't feel right so I didn't.
---
When I visited her,
I felt sympathy for her.
---
I did.
---
I saw that she was a very lost
and lonely soul and I saw
---
that if she was thrown in jail,
it would destroy her.
---
## SPEAKER:
What if she had killed me,
would you be so forgiving then?
---
## SPEAKER:
No, of course not.
---
## SPEAKER:
If the bullet
went 5 inches to the left, I'd be dead
---
so there's no difference in her action
just because she got lucky.
---
She cannot be allowed
to draw a gun on a country, that's that.
---
That's why she needs to go to jail.
---
[silence]
---
I think I realize
now that from the beginning,
---
I may have been under
some misconceptions.
---
## SPEAKER:
About?
---
## SPEAKER:
Expectations a bit.
---
## SPEAKER:
Can you elaborate?
---
## SPEAKER:
When I was arrested,
---
when we walked down the hill
and the cops were waiting for us, for me,
---
when they grabbed my arm
and twisted me around by force,
---
me, one of the most prominent doctors
in this country who uses these arms
---
to perform open-heart surgery
for people of all countries,
---
so the humiliation, the indignity of that.
---
When they lowered
my head into the police car,
---
like an animal being shoved into the car,
---
and they close the door and I saw you
on the other side of the window.
---
In the aloneness of my humiliation,
it hit me, like a sledgehammer,
---
it hit me that you didn't want
to share this with me.
---
## SPEAKER:
Share what?
## SPEAKER:
My humiliation.
---
## SPEAKER:
I tried to stop it.
---
Did you not hear me yell at the man
[crosstalk]?
---
I was trying to help.
## SPEAKER:
Yes, you were. I know.
---
That's all good.
---
I didn't expect you to do this
but it occurred to me afterwards
---
that [?] the policemen grabbed me,
---
you could have grabbed my other arm
and try to pull me away.
---
## SPEAKER:
You wanted me to play tug
of war with you?
---
## SPEAKER:
Or, you could have held on to me
and refused to let me go.
---
You could have said, "If she goes, I go,"
---
and you would have been pushed
and shoved into the car just like me.
---
## SPEAKER:
It never crossed my mind
to do that.
---
That is not in my nature.
---
When we were separated, the wheels
immediately started turning in my mind.
---
I started plotting about how to free you,
---
thinking of people [?] I could call.
I was even thinking,
---
"Did we have lunch?
---
Should I bring her food?"
How was I going to find you?
---
I was looking for an officer
who could tell me what your first stop was
---
so I could be at your side
as soon as humanly possible.
---
You're upset that I didn't force my way
into the car with you?
---
I'm sorry, but that's--
---
it doesn't seem like a fair expectation,
don't you think?
---
## SPEAKER:
Yes.
---
I agree.
---
That's why I said
I didn't expect you to do it.
---
## SPEAKER:
Then what are you saying?
What did I do wrong?
---
## SPEAKER:
To chain yourself
to another person,
---
to be manhandled, made a spectacle,
to put yourself in danger for them,
---
that's what I expect from my friends,
energy to do that.
---
That's okay but from behind the window,
---
I suddenly felt a different side
of you come out.
---
I realized you didn't have the capacity
to do those things.
---
I sense your hesitation.
---
[music]
---
## SPEAKER:
Who are you?
---
Who are you playing now?
---
## SPEAKER:
[?].
---
How I've been seen.
---
## SPEAKER:
Where are we?
---
## SPEAKER:
It looks like the temple, yes?
---
## SPEAKER:
It seems like it
but let's call this a cave and set.
---
Can you picture the place?
---
The smell of wet earth,
the uncertain terrain underfoot.
---
All the possible distances stretching
into the dark,
---
it can be a little scary, huh.
---
Yet, there's something about being
in the dark with you that's comforting.
---
It makes me feel I know you more.
---
How much can I know you?
---
This is something I struggled
with so much,
---
the struggle of being together
and being separate, right?
---
Think back to a person
---
with whom you've had differences
and reached an impasse.
---
The immovable wall that comes up gives
the feeling that even
---
if you practice empathy,
you can never truly understand
---
another person's experience, right?
---
This failure to connect is where the seeds
of anger and violence begin.
---
Before I cross your mind,
what if this person just disappeared,
---
wouldn't that be better?
---
It's crossed my mind
before I'm not going to lie.
---
Yet I think to [?],
a scholar from Country Z,
---
which suffered unspeakable oppression
at the hands of an outside force yet
---
still he said, "Oppressor
and oppressed are one,
---
like an overpowering tree
and its small leaf.
---
The leaf refines the tree's cell,
nourishing the tree,
---
so it is the mother of the tree,
which is its mother in turn,
---
so they are the same.
---
We cannot separate."
---
What if I said,
"Apply that to your enemy"?
---
Easier said than done, right?
---
It's still this feeling of isolation,
even if I tell you we are all linked.
---
Let's go deeper into the cave.
---
What I'm saying,
how I'm phrasing all of this,
---
is going to hit people in different ways.
---
This will hit you differently based
on the amount of, if I may,
---
privilege or non-privilege you have.
---
If you've experienced violence
or if you've experienced other hardships
---
that were life and death
to your soul but seem too small,
---
so you don't voice them.
---
They wound you from within.
---
Keep wounding,
---
adding to the deep ocean of wounds
of everyone else over lifetimes
---
and generations passed down.
---
These private wounds,
---
These differences of experience.
---
Let's go deeper into the cave.
---
You're receiving me in different ways.
---
Some may be moved, others not depending
on where you are in your lives.
---
Can I reach you just the same?
---
How about closure to our story?
---
Q returned to country Y
under unknown circumstances.
---
F?
---
Well, he had a terminal illness.
---
He passed on.
---
B's career recovered
and flourished once again.
---
The two met a few more times
before F passed,
---
but something had dimmed
since their first encounters.
---
So many of us
are just hanging on by a thread.
---
We are one loved one's death away
from the edge.
---
You feel that too?
---
I'm trying to reach you,
but what if I'm unable
---
to hold your interest much longer?
---
What if our connection right here
is a spell,
---
and what if it's starting to break?
---
Hang in there, please.
Stay with me.
---
Even if I run out of words,
stay with me.
---
I can't offer any tricks.
---
I'm really a simple man.
---
Will you stay with me still?
---
This may not fit in your expectations
of how things should be.
---
I acknowledge that.
But, still, stay with me just the same.
---
This is the test.
---
I don't want to lose you,
---
even if I have no more stories to tell.
---
This is the story right here.
---
It's coming.
Stay with me.
---
Hang in there.
---
Stay with me.
---
Stay with me.
---
Stay with me through this.
---
[background noise]
---
[silence]
---
## SPEAKER:
I can see you still.
---
