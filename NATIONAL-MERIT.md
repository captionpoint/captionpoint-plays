## CAMILA:
I WANT TO DIE
I want lightning to strike me so hard my body is split into a million pieces

---

and all the little pieces go flying everywhere until they’re spread across the world 
---
and smushed like little bugs over and over 

---

until all the pieces of me are pressed so hard into the earth that I just melt through all the cracks down down down 

---

until I’m sinking into the literal CORE and I’m dead.

---

 
Dead dead dead dead

---

## CISCO:
Bitch get off the floor.

---

## CAMILA:
They’re disgusting, Cisco.

---

## CISCO:
No way they’re that bad.

---

## JAX:
FIVE!

---

## JAX:
SIX!  

---

## JAX:
Can we do seven?!

---

## YASH: 
Uh uh   

---

## CISCO:
….
shit.

---

## JAX:
Looking good, Camila.

---

## CAMILA:
Dean Gordon’s literally never had a problem with my shorts being hemmed before.

---

I confront him one time and suddenly I’m directly impacting the school’s “image”

---

## CISCO:
Asshole

---

## CAMILA:
He was looking at my ass&nbsp;—

---

## JAX:
He was probably just inspecting your shorts.

---

That’s his job&nbsp;—

---

## CISCO:
No he was definitely looking at her ass

---

## CAMILA:
He was looking at my ass.

---

 
So I was like

---

## CISCO:
You went OFF

---

## CAMILA:
Do you get paid to ride around in a little golf cart and check out literal minors?

---

## JAX:
You’re seventeen, not ten

---

## YASH:
Dude–

---

## CAMILA:
And you’re an asshole, not a dick?

---

## JENNY:
WOO!! Welcome everyone!!


---

## CAMILA: 
FUCK JUNIOR YEAR

---

## CISCO:
Jenny?

---

You’re our senior mentor?

---

## JENNY:
Yep! 

---

## CISCO:
Slay

---

## JAX:
Is that Miss Princeton?

---

## JENNY: 
Hi, Jax

---

## JAX: 
Yo, congratulations.

---

That’s huge.

---

## JENNY:
It’s no big deal, I mean
Likely letters from Princeton are extremely rare

---

## CAMILA:
You got a likely letter?!

---

## MELISSA:
Jenny?

---

## JENNY:
Melissa.

---

## MELISSA:
What are you doing here?

---

## CISCO:
Jenny’s our senior mentor

---

## MELISSA:
Of course…

---

## YASH:
What’s a likely letter?

---

## JENNY:
Um basically it’s when the school knows they want to accept you, 

---
so they let you know before decisions are officially released.

---

## CAMILA:          
Wow.

---

## YASH:
Schools do that??

---

## JAX:
So you’re, like, their ideal student basically?

---

## JENNY:
I guess you could say that, yeah

---

## JENNY:
I still have to keep it up this year if I want the acceptance confirmed…

---

But yeah! I’m so excited to be here, guys!! Alex is amazing.

---


He gives this crazy speech on the first day of class that&nbsp;—

---

## MELISSA:
It’s three thirty-seven. Where’s Mr. Alvarez?

---

## JENNY:
I’m sure he’ll be here soon, he’s usually not…
I mean, he’s like.

---

A legend basically.

---

He was also a National Merit Scholar, I’m pretty sure he went to Dartmouth 

---
and he’s had all his students get National Merit Semifinalist or Commended for three years in a row&nbsp;—

---

## MELISSA:
He went to Cornell, not Dartmouth.

---

## JAX:
Famously the easiest Ivy to get into.

---

## JENNY:
Whatever. Same thing.

---

## JAX: 
11%  acceptance rate?
C’mon….

---

## JENNY:
Basically, he, like, Super knows what he’s doing.

---

All of us got Merit last year, and more than half as Semifinalists.

---

## MELISSA:
Mr. Alvarez means everything for our success.

---

## JENNY:
You can just call him Alex

---

## MELISSA:
There are over two hundred National Merit Scholars every year at 

---

EVERYONE
Yale.

---

## MELISSA:
I advocated for my place in this class.

---
Unlike most people who would settle for whatever random tutor they’re assigned to…

---

## CISCO:
I thought they placed us using our scores?

---

## JAX:
You’re not special, Melissa.
Everyone wanted him.

---

## MELISSA:
I thought you didn’t care.

---

## JAX:
I don’t.

---

My mom does.

---

I’m pretty sure she called anyone with a title to get me in here in true Janet fashion.

---

## YASH:
Janeeeet.

---

Zucchini bread queen.

---

## CISCO: 
Jenny do you know if they use our scores?

---

## JENNY:
Um...
I can ask and see–

---

## MELISSA:
I doubt it.

---

This is the most random collection of students I could possibly imagine.

---

## MELISSA:
I thought she didn’t go here anymore.

---

## JAX: 
Maybe Principal Hughes felt bad?

---

About the Ian thing&nbsp;—

---

## CAMILA:
Jax SSHHHH

---

## JAX:
What?

---

I can’t say his name?

---

## CAMILA:
I thought she’d never come back to Westbrook.

---

## JENNY:
I’m pretty sure Principal Hughes made an exception?

---

## JAX:
Someone should wake her up, right?

---

Yash, tap her shoulder.

---

## YASH:
Why do I have to?

---

## JAX:
You’re closer.

---

## YASH:
Cisco’s closer! Why can’t he?

---

## CISCO:
Nuh-uh.

---

## JENNY:
Maybe we shouldn’t&nbsp;—

---

## ARIANA:
Ow! What the&nbsp;—

---

## YASH: 
Sorry
Hi.

---

## MELISSA:
Where do you go to school now?

---

## ARIANA:
…
Sawgrass.

---

## CAMILA:
It’s better getting to wear what you want, isn’t it?

---

You get to, like, express yourself.

---

 
I fucking hate these khakis.

---

## MELISSA:
I like the uniforms. They’re like an equalizer.

---

## CAMILA:
I wish I went to public school.

---

People seem so much more fun there, like they’re just…more crazy, you know?

---

I wish Westbrook was more CRAZY.

---

Isn’t there always crazy shit going down there?

---

[A roar of thunder.]

---

## ALEX:
Apologies.

---

As you can see, I did not expect the heavy rain today.

---

## ALEX:
How was everyone’s weekend?

---

## ALEX:
Boring?

---

## ALEX:
Alright.

Let’s talk about your preliminary practice test.

---

## JAX:
My weekend was pretty great honestly.

---

## ALEX:
Excuse me?

---

## JAX:
My weekend.
It was pretty great.
Had a good time.

---

## CAMILA:
Jax…

---

## JAX:
What?

He asked how our weekend was so I answered.

---

## ALEX:
That’s great you had a good weekend, uh&nbsp;—

---

## JAX:
Jax.

---

## MELISSA:
Just ignore him, Mr. Alvarez.

---

## ALEX:
Please, call me Alex.

---

## CAMILA:
He does this to every teacher.

---

## JAX:
That’s right.

---

I’m extremely polite and attentive to every teacher’s questions.

---

## ALEX:
Why did you have a great weekend?

---

## JAX:
Uhhh…I got to relax.

---

Hang out with friends.

---

## ALEX:
And what did you and your friends talk about?

---

## JAX:
Uhh…

---

## ALEX:
Anything about integers?

---

## JAX:
…no.

---

## ALEX:
Quadratic formulas?

---

## JAX:
No

---

## ALEX:
Numerical representations?

---

## JAX:
No

---

## ALEX:
Manipulating polynomials?

---

## JAX:
I said I had a great weekend&nbsp;—

---

## ALEX:
If you’re in this course you know 
---
the time for hanging out with friends all weekend has passed.

---

You shouldn’t be going a day without the PSAT on your mind.

---

## ALEX:
Can anyone tell me what this number is?

---

## CAMILA:
…
number of students in the program?

---

## ALEX:
Nope.

---

## YASH:
One in five hundred chance we get National Merit?

---

## ALEX:
Luckily your chances are a bit better than that.

---

## MELISSA:
It’s a score.

---

## ALEX:
Correct.

---

## MELISSA:
But that’s way too low for Merit.

---

## ALEX:
This number is this class’s average score for the math section of the preliminary practice test you all took last week.

---

## MELISSA:
Are we getting our individual scores too?

---

Clearly someone in the class is weighing us down.

---

## ALEX:
We take into account everyone’s strengths and weaknesses.

---

We’re preparing as a class.

---

## MELISSA:
But we’re not taking this test as a class.

---

It doesn’t matter if two people here suck at math to me.

---

It doesn’t help me raise my score.

---

## ALEX:
These are group sessions&nbsp;—

---

## MELISSA:
Is no one else interested in knowing your score?

---

## YASH:
…I’d be down to know my score.

---

## CAMILA:
Same.

---

## JAX:
Same.

---

## CISCO:
Same.

---

## JAX:
You should say them out loud.

---

## ALEX:
Jenny.

---

What do you think?

---

Should they get their scores?

---

## JENNY: 
Yes.

---

## ALEX:
Yes?

---

## JENNY:
Yes.

---

## ALEX:
Alright.

---

Give them their scores.

---

## JENNY:
Okay um.

---

I can call you guys up uh.

---

Jax.

---

## ALEX:
None of you performed at a National Merit level, as expected.

---

That’s why we’re here.

---

## ALEX:
Thirty days.

That’s how many days are left until the test.

---

## JENNY:
Camila.

---

## ALEX:
And Mars Prep is giving you the opportunity to use those thirty days to Turn Things Around.

---

## ALEX:
To help you Change Your Life.

---

But 
You need to want it
Work
Study

---

## JENNY:
Cisco.

---

## ALEX:
Every.

Day.

---

Dinner?
Study.

---

Bus stop?

---

Study.

---

Can’t sleep?

---

Study.

---

## JENNY:
Yash.

---

## ALEX:
Everything else can wait because you have thirty days.

---

And in those thirty days you are not the president of the mock trial team 

---

## JENNY:
Ariana.

---

## ALEX:
or first chair in orchestra or a model UN champion.

---

## JENNY:
Melissa.

---

## ALEX:
For the next thirty days, you are a National Merit Scholar in training.

---

  
Last year half my students in your position were Semifinalists.

---

Can we beat that?

---

[Clock ticks. Thunder.]

---

## JENNY:
YAAAY!! Cisco’s here!!

---

## CAMILA:
Where were you?

---

## CAMILA:
You’re running for class president?

---

## CAMILA:
Since when?

---

## JENNY: 
Uh oh! That’s where the Mr. Mars poster goes!

---

## CAMILA:
Jenny, we’re in test prep, not fucking day care.

---

## MELISSA:
You know Megan’s been our class president two yours in a row already

---

## CISCO:
I was thinking about it yesterday and it just clicked.

---

This is what I’m meant to do.

---

## MELISSA:
Megan’s gonna hate this…

---

## CAMILA:
Cisco.

---

Maybe you should think about this.

---

## JENNY:
Maybe the poster can go on this wall instead?

---

## CAMILA:
I know PSAT stuff has been stressful.

---

And stuff with your dad&nbsp;—

---

## CISCO:
I’m serious about this.

---

## JENNY:
This is a suuuper hot wall if you think about it.

---

## CAMILA:
Maybe this is more of a next year thing?

---

Like a fun senior year prank?

---

## CISCO:
Junior year counts the most with colleges.

---

## CAMILA:
Cisco, you hate politicians.

---

## CISCO:
Everyone has their thing! Jax has debate.

---

Yash has Spanish Honor Society.

---

## YASH:
Corecto.

---

## CISCO:
Ariana plays piano.

---

Melissa has National Honor Society.

---

## MELISSA:
And Mock Trial.

---

## CISCO:
And Mock Trial.
You have&nbsp;—

---

## MELISSA:
And Community Service Club and Art Club.

---

## CAMILA:
You have things too, Cisco.

---

## CISCO:
Name one of my things.

---

## CAMILA:
…
You’re so funny, and everyone loves to be around you&nbsp;—

---

## CISCO:
Nice, I’ll be sure to put “so funny” right at the top of my college resume&nbsp;—

---

## CAMILA:
Cisco&nbsp;—

---

## CISCO:
Camila, I’m doing this with or without your support.

---

## ALEX:
What is this?

---

## JENNY:
I tried to get them to take it down, but&nbsp;—

---

## CISCO:
I’m running for class president.

---

## ALEX:
Take it down, Cisco.

---

## CISCO:
Can I at least leave it up for one week?

---

## ALEX:
Take it down.

---

## CISCO:
I spent all night designing that poster&nbsp;—

---

## ALEX:
Maybe if you spent that time on PSAT you wouldn’t need private sessions.

---

## ALEX:
Are you going to take it down or should I?

---

## ALEX:
Everyone take out your reading assignment from yesterday please.

---

## ALEX:
Alright. When we--

---

## JENNY:
Um Alex can I&nbsp;—?

---

## ALEX:
Oh.

---

Right.

---

Jenny has an announcement to make.

---

## JENNY:
Hi everyone! Um.

---

As a way to personalize the program more, I’ll be having one-on-ones with each of you.

---

Like a check in to see how you’re doing, what your goals are.

---

You can ask me questions, I’ll ask you questions.

---

It’ll just be me and you, super caj (shortened from "casual").

---

Just twenty minutes&nbsp;—

---

## ALEX:
Ten minutes

---

## JENNY:
Ten minutes of your time.

---

I’ll send an email with the sign up link, and on whatever day you sign up, 
---
I’ll pull you out of class and we’ll have our check-in outside&nbsp;—

---

## JENNY:
Yes, Melissa?

---

## MELISSA:
What if we don’t want to miss any of the class?

---

## JENNY:
You’ll absolutely be kept you up to date&nbsp;—

---

## MELISSA: 
I’m sorry but I don’t know how we’re expected to prioritize a nice little chat over actually working&nbsp;—

---

## JENNY:
It’s not just a chat, it’s a way to reflect on your progress and maximize your time in this course.

---

## MELISSA:
How is it maximizing my time if I’m missing part of the lesson?

---

## JENNY:
If you could just have an open mind you’d realize there’s more to test taking then just lessons&nbsp;—

---

## ALEX:
I’m sure you two can coordinate a time outside of class.

---

## JENNY:
I just don’t get why we should be giving special treatment&nbsp;—

---

## MELISSA:
Special treatment?

---

## ALEX:
Enough.

---

Jenny, find a time, make it work.

---

We’re wasting precious minutes.

---

## JENNY:
…okay.

---

## MELISSA: (to Alex)
Thank you.

---

## ALEX:
So.

---


When we go into the reading section what do we do first?

---

## STUDENTS:
Read the questions

---

## ALEX:
Then?

---

## STUDENTS:
Look for the answers

---

## ALEX:
Because?

---

## STUDENTS:
You don’t need to read the whole thing.

---

## ALEX:
That’s right.

---

Waste of time.

---

## ALEX:
Yes, Ariana?

---

## ARIANA:
I actually thought it worked better to read the whole thing.

---

Specifically for question five?

---


The whole read-the-questions-first method was pretty confusing for that one.

---

## ALEX:
Did you look thoroughly for the answer?

---

## ARIANA:
I guess I just have a problem with the question, really.

---

Like I get that she explicitly states she doesn’t think there’s enough awareness about endangered sea turtles, 

---
so that fits with answer B,

---

but if you read the whole thing, her tone suggests she is placing the blame on humanity so that would be C.

---

## ALEX:
Does she ever explicitly say that?

---

## ARIANA:
Not in the same way&nbsp;—
---

## ALEX:
Exactly.

---

## ARIANA:
But the thing about awareness is just in one paragraph.

---

She implies that we are to blame throughout the entire essay.

---

## ALEX:
This isn’t about what’s implied.

---

## ARIANA:
Then how is that critical reading?

---

## ALEX:
I’ll take a look at that later.

---

Um.

---

Any other questions?

---

[Ariana plays a piano concerto] 

---

## ALEX:
Our first perfect score of the class.

---

Congratulations, Ariana.

---

## ARIANA:
Those are my Cheetos.

---

## YASH:
Oh my god.

---

I’m.

I’m sorry.

---

I don’t know why I did that.

---

Not that it’s like inherently evil to take someone’s food, at the end of the day it’s a pretty harmless act

---

unless, like, you’re dealing with someone who has a small amount of food available to them, 

---

which maybe you are and I just took away the last snack you hoped to enjoy

---

## ARIANA:
You did not take away my last snack.

---

## YASH:
That’s what I thought, which is why…which is why I did that.

---

Because no one got hurt.

---

But maybe you did get hurt, like, in a more emotional way?

---

Because even though no one got hurt hurt, it’s still wrong.

---

It’s Wrong To Take People’s Snacks Without Asking.

---

Sorry

---

## ARIANA:
It’s fine.

---

You can take more if you want.

---

## YASH:
Oh.

---

Cool.

---

## ARIANA:
Where’s your boss?

---

## YASH:
Huh?

---

## ARIANA:
Jax

---

## YASH:
Oh.

---

Well.

---

He’s not really, like, my boss.

---

It’s more of an equal footing thing.

---

I’m pretty sure.

---


But yeah, he’s coming later.

---

He has debate Tuesdays and Thursdays.

---

## YASH:
You’d think after starting this class I’d look at this problem and know where to start, but I have no idea…

---

## ARIANA:
It’s just steps.

---

## YASH: 
It’s just steps.

---

## ARIANA:
And you just follow them.

---

Look.

---

## YASH:
That notebook’s awesome.

---

## ARIANA:
Thanks, it was my brother’s.

---

## YASH:
oh.

---

Yeah, that’s&nbsp;—
I’m.

---

Wow, I mean.

---

Not wow, just.

---

That’s&nbsp;—
I’m sorry.

---

That must be really hard.

---

## ARIANA:
It’s fine.

---

## YASH:
...
The headphones were his too, right?

---


Last year I would always walk past him after fifth period,

---

Laying on the bench in front of the English building,
Just staring up at the sky…

---

He had those headphones in, every time
I never really talked to him but

---

It was cool to see someone just, laying down and taking a second
I kind of miss it, seeing him there every day…

---

## JENNY:
Oh. Wow.

---

We’ve got early birds today!

---

## YASH:
How are you Jenny?

---

## JENNY: 
I am.

---

Um.

---

Making it Through!

---

## JENNY:
Shit!

---

## JENNY:
Hi, Melissa.

---

## MELISSA:
Hm.

---

## CAMILA:
I can’t miss study group.

---

## CISCO:
This debate could win me the election.

---

## CAMILA:
If I don’t go to study group, I don’t get shared on the study guide for the quiz this week

---

## CISCO:
Then make your own study guide this week.

---

## CAMILA:
You don’t get it.

---

## CISCO:
Avogadro’s Number is not that complicated&nbsp;—

---

## CAMILA:
You’re not in AP Chem.

---

You didn’t even take Honors.

---

## CISCO:
Excuse me?

---

## CAMILA:
I’m just saying you don't get the kind of stress&nbsp;—

---

## CISCO:
So I can’t comprehend the same concepts as you?

---

## CAMILA:
It’s a fact that I’m in a harder class.

---

That’s all.

---

## ALEX:
Alright.

---

## ALEX:    
Thank you everyone for your timeliness, we have a lot to go over today.

---

 
Jenny, were you able to print out the exercise?

---

## JENNY:
Yep! Reading exercise seven&nbsp;—

---

## ALEX:
Seven?

---

We discussed eight yesterday.

---

## JENNY:
I thought, in your last email it&nbsp;—

---

## ALEX:
I’ll be right back.

---

## JENNY:
Um...

---

Okay! Why don’t we all take out the homework! 

---

## JENNY:
Answer keys.

---

Why don’t we check our answers while Alex is printing?

---

## ARIANA:
I have a question on page&nbsp;—

---

## JENNY:
This is the right exercise oh my god uh
I’m gonna go find Alex and 
I’ll be 
Right back

---

## JENNY:
Please just.

---

Focus on your answers sheets.

---


---

## JAX:
Quick quick: mustache or dick?

---

## YASH:
Mustache

---

## CISCO:
Dick

---

## JAX:
Dick it is

---

## MELISSA:
We shouldn’t be touching the Mr. Mars poster…

---

## JAX:
Relax, it’s only pencil 

---

## CAMILA: 
Melissa’s right.

---

Mr. Mars poster is off limits even for you, Jax

---

## YASH:
Jax, maybe you should erase it.

---

If Alex comes back&nbsp;—

---

## JAX:
I’m not scared of Alex

---

## MELISSA:
Ha!

---

## CAMILA: 
Cap.

---

## JAX:
What’s the worst he can say?

---


Oh, it’s Mr. Mars, Mr. Mars means we treat the classroom like the testing room
Study.

---

Work.

---

Practice.

---


Thirty DAYS!!!!   

---

## ALEX:
Alright, we’ve got exercise eight.

---

## ARIANA:
I have a question&nbsp;—

---

## ALEX:
Jax.

Where’s Jenny?

---

## JAX:
Uhh printing something I think

---

## CAMILA:
Told you it was cap.

---

## JAX: 
I was planning on erasing it anyways 

---

## MELISSA: 
Wasn’t even a good drawing 

---

## JAX:
We get it, you’re in AP Art

---

## CISCO:
Camila, do you get this?

---

## CAMILA:
I don’t know I’m working on chem right now.

---

## MELISSA:
Luckily I already covered exponential equations at home a couple days ago or I’d be pretty confused too.

---

## CISCO:
You practice at home?

---

## MELISSA:
I dedicate at least an hour before bed to review the most challenging concepts.

---

I’ve gone through basically every PSAT and SAT prep book out there: Princeton Review, Barrons, Kaplan&nbsp;—

---

## MELISSA:
Whatever.

I don’t know why I even bother offering my study tips.

---

## JAX:
Yeah I don’t take study tips from someone with approximately one point five friends

---

## JENNY: 
What?

---

## MELISSA:
You don’t know me.

---

## ARIANA:
I have a question&nbsp;—

---

## JAX:
Oh sorry, three point five.

---

Forgot to count Barron and Kaplan

---

## YASH:  
Jax&nbsp;—

---

## JENNY:
Have you guys even checked your answers?

---

## MELISSA:
Why are you here?

---

You love to act like you don’t care, but still you’re here, every day&nbsp;—

---

## JAX:
Why is anyone here?

---

## JENNY:
I asked you guys specifically to&nbsp;—

---

## JAX:
Why is Cisco here?

---

Testing is clearly not his thing&nbsp;—

---

## CISCO:
Excuse me?

---

## JAX:
And Ariana?

---

She famously hates Westbrook.

---

 
It’s ‘cause that’s what you do junior year.

---

It’s just like taking APUSH or applying for summer internships.

---

It’s part of the whole thing&nbsp;—

---

## JENNY:
Jax&nbsp;—

---

## MELISSA:
And this “thing” takes work that clearly only some of us like to put in&nbsp;—

---

## JAX:
Some of us have this other thing, I don’t know if you’ve heard of it, it’s called a social life?

---

## JENNY:
Jax.

---

## ARIANA:
Can I please ask my question?

---

## YASH:
Jax, why don’t we just check our answers&nbsp;—

---

## JENNY:
I think Yash has the right idea!

---

## JAX:
No need to get all embarrassed about it.

---

Everyone knows you have lunch in Mrs. Patterson’s classroom&nbsp;—

---

## MELISSA:
Have you ever considered that maybe, possibly, I don’t sit at lunch with Mrs. Patterson because I don’t have friends, 
---
but because I actually have the capacity to talk to an actual adult?

---

## MELISSA:
Or that I go to her for lunch because she’s the only Black teacher I’ve ever had here 

---

and I have an important connection with her that I value because people who actually think about their futures have mentors, 

---

Jax, can you name a single person over the age of eighteen that would genuinely enjoy speaking with you?

---

## MELISSA:
Yeah that’s what I thought.

---

## JAX:
...

I didn’t know the Mrs. Patterson thing was like…like a serious, like&nbsp;—

---

## CAMILA:
You didn’t think it was a race thing?

---

## JAX:
That’s, I mean, I&nbsp;—

---

## CAMILA:
Can’t even hear the word race without getting all nervous 

---

## JENNY:
Okay wow.

---

I see we’ve reached a…point of tension.

---

Why don’t we all take a deep breath&nbsp;—

---

## JAX:
I obviously didn’t think of it in that way, I was just stating an objective fact, it’s literally true that Melissa&nbsp;—

---

## CAMILA:
Why haven’t we cancelled Jax yet?

---

## MELISSA:
Trust me, I’ve tried…

---

## JAX:
Cancel culture is the poison of our generation

---

## CAMILA:
You’re the poison of our generation

---

## JAX:
Wow, you really got me there, huh?

---

Really hit me where it&nbsp;—

---

## ARIANA:
Can you just shut up and check your answers!
I don’t know what your mommy tells you, 

---

but everyone actually isn’t that interested in hearing everything you have to say.

---

And I’m here because my mom wouldn’t let me leave Westbrook unless I could take this class.

---

Not because it’s "part of the whole thing."

---

## JAX:
…
I don’t call my mom mommy.

---

 
And I already checked my answers.

---

I got everything right so, didn’t take long.

---

## MELISSA:
You did not get a perfect score on that.

---

## JAX:
Here.

---

## JENNY:
No don’t&nbsp;—

---

## JAX:
Check.

---

## JENNY:
We shouldn’t be swapping worksheets.

---

Alex is very&nbsp;—

---

## ALEX:
Jenny

---

## JENNY:
I’m SO sorry&nbsp;—

---

## ALEX:
Just pass these papers out now.

---

Quickly, please.

---

## ALEX:
Apologies for the frantic energy today.

---

Hopefully this exercise will be worth it.

---

Exercise eight is all about&nbsp;—

---

## ARIANA:
I have a question.

---

## ALEX:
Yes, Ariana?

---

## ARIANA:
I’m still confused about how we’re approaching these reading passages?

---

## MELISSA:
Five! Five wrong! Suck it, Jax Wilson!

---

## ALEX: 
We should be keeping our worksheets to ourselves…

---

## JAX: 
Thanks for doing that for me, was reeeeaaally not in the mood to do it myself

---

## ALEX:
The test is less than three weeks away!
Let me say that again.

---


The test is less than three weeks away.

---


If there was ever a time to take this lightly, it’s completely passed by now.

---

## ALEX:
Alright, everyone flip to page 67.

---

Math drill.

---

Fifteen minutes.

---

## ARIANA:
What about my question?

---

## ALEX:
We’ll address it later.

---

Everyone get to work, time’s already started.

---

[Ticks. Rain.]

---

## ALEX:
Every class goes at its own pace.

---

We’ll just push the schedule, put them both on the agenda for tomorrow.

---

Thanks, Jenny. You're good to go.

---

## JENNY:
Great!
Oh and,
I actually had some ideas?

---

For the next couple weeks, since we’re running behind&nbsp;—

---

## ALEX:
Running behind happens every year.

---

## JENNY:
Right, I was just thinking maybe&nbsp;—

---

## ALEX:
We always catch up.

---

And if we don’t, I’ve purposely left parabolas for the end.

---

They only make up about one to two percent of the test, sometimes zero.

---

## JENNY:
Totally I just
And so so fine if this is like So Stupid, this is just a suggestion and you know what you’re doing,

---

I mean that’s why Mr. Mars regards you so highly but

---

We might save time if we didn’t have them correct the homework during class?

---

I feel like we could use that extra time for other things, like useful ways to cope during this&nbsp;—

---

## ALEX:
Correcting in class ensures that they remember to ask all their questions, and learn from their mistakes&nbsp;—

---

## JENNY:
Yes right, Sorry I&nbsp;—

---

## ALEX:
I’ve been doing this for seven years.

---

With outstanding results&nbsp;—

---

## JENNY:
Amazing results, yes&nbsp;—

---

## ALEX:
I’m very good at my job

---

## JENNY:
Yes! I agree, I guess I’m thinking more about, like, my job?

---

As senior mentor?

---


I feel like as a student too I have a lot I can offer
Like, just, from experience
Ways to improve productivity and increase morale?

---

## ALEX:
Your job isn’t to increase morale&nbsp;—

---

## JENNY:
I know, I just mean&nbsp;—

---

## ALEX:
Your job is to make sure everything’s running smoothly, which clearly you are still struggling with&nbsp;—

---

## JENNY:
Again, I am so sorry about yesterday&nbsp;—

---

## ALEX:
Jenny I appreciate your enthusiasm.

---


Your energy and your little quotes on the board and your… initiative with organizing the check-ins, it’s all very sweet, 

---

but at the end of the day we’re preparing them for a test.

---

That’s where their focus needs to be.

---

## JENNY:
Even just the homework thing could make a huge difference&nbsp;—

---

## ALEX:
Okay fine.

---

You can grade the homework outside of class from now on.

---

## JENNY:
Oh.

---

Uh.

---

Me?

Um.

---

I don’t know if&nbsp;—

---

## ALEX:
Would that be problem?

---

Because if you can’t then I’d&nbsp;—

---

## JENNY:
No no no
It’s fine I’m just

---

I’m just thinking about how I have this every afternoon and also cheer practice, 
---
plus all my school work and clubs and, so, it may be…

---

I mean if I need to make time for it, I’ll make time for it, I

---

I do want to do a good job but

---

Yeah
Yes.

---


Yes! I can do it, I’ll 
I can grade the homeworks.

---

[Reggaeton music]

---

## JENNY:
Do you need me to repeat the question?

---

## MELISSA:
No I heard you

---

## JENNY:
Reflecting on your strengths and weaknesses is an excellent way to&nbsp;—

---

## MELISSA:
I’ve already reflected on them 

---

## JENNY:
No. You haven’t.

---

## MELISSA:
I could be reflecting on them right now and you wouldn’t even know

---

## JENNY:
You know what I mean&nbsp;— 

---

## MELISSA:
What are my strengths and weaknesses, Jenny?

---

## JENNY:
I asked you first&nbsp;—

---

## MELISSA:
I thought we could both ask questions

---

## JENNY:
If you think my thoughts would be useful to your process, then, yes, maybe I can&nbsp;—

---

## MELISSA:
I would love your thoughts.

---

## JENNY:
…

okay.

---

I think you’re very driven.

---

It's impressive.

---

Nothing gets in your way.

---

I think you show the most promise in our group for National Merit 

---

But promise doesn’t mean you’ll actually get it, 
---
because even though you work really hard, 
---
for some reason you love to do it all alone.

---

That’s your weakness.

---

Your drive isolates you.

---

## JENNY:
Any reactions to that?

---

## JENNY:
I know you’re still upset about the feminist club presidency&nbsp;—

---

## MELISSA:
You only won because it was a popularity contest&nbsp;—

---

## JENNY:
Which, if you think about it, you being cold to me for winning is actually super anti-feminist&nbsp;—

---

## MELISSA:
I made a thirty-slide powerpoint and you pulled up a slideshow of protest pictures 
---
with We Can’t Stop by Miley Cyrus playing in the background&nbsp;—

---

## JENNY:
If you actually listen to the chorus it literally WORKS&nbsp;—

---

## MELISSA:
I’m not cold.

---


I just don’t worship the ground you walk on like everyone else at this school

---

I could just not want to be your friend and that’s okay

---

It doesn’t make me a bad person.

---

## JENNY:
We’re wasting time&nbsp;—

---

## MELISSA:
Wasting time for you to tell me to “reflect” and take deep breaths?

---

## JENNY:
Deep breaths would certainly help with the stress&nbsp;—

---

## MELISSA:
If we were meant to feel fine, we wouldn’t have to do any of this.

---

Sure, I could take some deep breaths
But as soon as I take that last exhale 

---

I’m back where I started, and it hits me all at once: There Is So Much To Do.

---

And I have to get used to it all over again.

---

Why would I do that?

---

## JENNY:
What are the areas you are most looking to improve?

---

## JENNY:
You know, you’re not the only one that’s overwhelmed.

---

I get it, you’re stressed, it's a high pressure time, 
---
but half the school is functioning on college dreams and caffeine.

---

I set aside time outside of class for you.

---

So if you could just meet me here for a second, so we can get this over with quickly and peacefully 
---
I would really appreciate that because fun fact?

---

I also don't really want to be here and I also don’t particularly enjoy your company.

---

## MELISSA:
Not many areas to improve.

---

I’ve been killing the practice tests, so 
Maybe parabolas.

---

## ARIANA:
I have a question about number sixteen.

---

## MELISSA:
Of course…

---

## ARIANA:
I can’t really find the evidence for why the answer is B.

---

I looked in every paragraph and there may be some argument&nbsp;—

---

## ALEX:
If you take a look at line 23&nbsp;—

---

## ARIANA:
Line 23, yeah, I see that, but line 23 isn’t even a factual statement?

---

And I thought that’s what we’re looking for.

---

## ALEX:
Again, we’re looking for explicit evidence&nbsp;—

---

## ARIANA:
It’s not explicit.

---

It’s a theory.

---

It’s literally an assumption&nbsp;—

---

## ALEX:
It’s important to treat every reading passage as it’s own&nbsp;—

---

## ARIANA:
As its own thing.

---

Yes, I know&nbsp;—

---

## ALEX:
Then what is the problem, Ariana?

---

This is the material&nbsp;—

---

## ARIANA:
We should learn to look at these with an actual nuanced perspective&nbsp;—

---

## ALEX:
There is a method if you would give a chance&nbsp;—

---

## ARIANA:
What method?!

---

If I look at the method one way it’s C, if I look at it another way it could be A&nbsp;—

---

## ALEX:
I’m staring at the answer sheet and the answer sheet says B.

---

B.

---

That’s the answer.

---

That’s it.

---

 
You can hate it all you want but fact is, if this question shows up on the test two weeks from now 
---
and you don’t choose B, you will just be Wrong.

---

Boom.

A quarter point gone.

---

A quarter point farther from being a Semifinalist.

---

 
That’s what you’re here for, right?

---

Because you want National Merit?

---

 
If that’s not what you want, if what you want is to float around your big idea, 
---
then by all means leave this class and start a blog or something.

---

Join a book club.

---

Take a philosophy class.

---

 
But right now, You Are Here.

---

## YASH:
Wait um.

---

## JAX:
What are you doing?

---

## YASH:
I don’t know I just…do not feel okay at all with what just happened.

---

I…I like Ariana’s questions and&nbsp;—

---

## JAX:
Dude&nbsp;—

---

## ARIANA:
It’s fine, Yash.

---

Thank you.

But I’m fine.

---

You know as of this year almost 2,000 schools are making standardized tests optional for admissions?

---
Including Harvard.

---

Give it at most ten, maybe even just five years, and all of this doesn’t even matter.

---

Your job doesn’t matter.

---

And you know what the funniest thing is?

---

I’m gonna get Merit.

---

But I was gonna get it whether I took this class or not.

---

And you knew that, the moment you saw my first score.

---

Because that’s how these tests work.

---

You either get it or you don’t.

---

And it doesn’t mean you’re smart, it doesn’t mean you deserve a better education, it doesn’t mean anything.

---

It’s just a stupid, arbitrary metric to brainwash us into thinking meritocracy is real.

---

## ALEX:
Alright.
We are…over time.

---

I’ll see you all tomorrow.

---

## MELISSA:
The test optional thing isn’t even that serious.

---

Everyone knows it’ll still be a huge strength in your application, especially for more selective schools.

---

[Piano Music. Thunder.]

---

## JAX:
So.

You and Ariana.

---

Are you guys like&nbsp;—?

---

## YASH:
Purely platonic

---

## JAX:
You’re ditching me for a platonic hang?

---

Are you gonna help her plan an anti-Westbrook protest or something?

---

## YASH:
Dude

---

## JAX:
I mean I totally get it.

---

It’s fucked up what happened but
I don’t know

---
It seems like a lot of blame to pin on one school…

---

## YASH:
You don’t think Westbrook has anything to do with it?

---

## JAX:
I’m sure every high school has a suicide count.

---

## YASH:
Jax

---

## JAX:
We’re talking between the two of us, it’s fine&nbsp;—

---

## YASH:
I just think&nbsp;—
Never mind.

---

## JAX:
What?

---

## YASH:
It’s fine.

---

## JAX:
No.

Say it.

---

## YASH: 
… sometimes you make this a weird space for everybody.

---

And…it feels weird to be hanging out with them and then hang out with you as if nothing’s happening.

---

## JAX:
…what are you talking about?

---

## YASH:
Like…I don’t know, pretending to kill yourself when Ariana’s right there&nbsp;—

---

## JAX:
That was a joke&nbsp;—

---

## YASH:
And with Melissa it’s…

---

You’re a white guy picking on this Black girl

---

## JAX:
I don’t pick on her, it goes both ways

---

## YASH:
It goes one way more than the other.

---

## JAX:
…
It’s not racism, if that’s what you’re saying

---

## JAX:
It’s not 

---

You think I’m racist?

---

## YASH:
I don’t think you’re racist, it’s just a bit&nbsp;—

---

## JAX:
I’ve had many people look down on me, more than I can fucking count, but no one like Melissa.

---

## YASH:
It’s not just about Melissa&nbsp;—

---

## JAX:
Okay what’s going on?

---

Do you have platonic plans with her too now?

---

## YASH:
You significantly impact my time in this class.

---

You distract me.

You make me feel like I can’t take this seriously.

---

Sometimes you say things and they’re just fucked up and I have to apologize for you&nbsp;—

---

## JAX:
I’m just trying to keep things light and funny, but everyone’s so&nbsp;—

---

## YASH:
WOULD YOU PLEASE LISTEN TO ME.

---

GOD.

---

It's like every conversation we have, everything we do together,  I’m always gonna be second to you.

---

And you don’t even care, you love it.

---

It’s like I’m the silly side character who’s sweet and likable but he’ll never actually win anything.

---

Or Be anything.

---

And I can’t even blame you completely for it because I fucking do it to myself! 

---

I put myself right into that little box, right into that side character box, 
---
and it still feels shitty and I still stay there because I don’t know what else I can be! 

---

And being a National Merit Scholar, doing well here, making new friends, that’s a way I can get out of it.

---

A way I can move past this perpetual side characterness, and you’re getting in the way.

---

## JAX:
I don’t know what Ariana’s putting into your head, or if like

---

You’re too stressed or whatever
But
You wouldn’t even be in this class if it weren’t for me.

---

## ALEX:
So we’re up against the same problem&nbsp;—we can’t solve two variables at once.

---

So what do we do?

---

## CISCO:
Um.

---

## ALEX:
We’re following the same steps we went over for number four.

---

It’s just a new set of equations.

---

## CISCO:
I guess I still don’t really know&nbsp;—

---

## ALEX:
This is our second session working through these problems. 
---
If you’re not focusing now, we’re going to keep going in circles&nbsp;—

---

## CISCO:
I am focusing.

---

Like, really hard.

---

…
I’m just not good at this.

---

## ALEX:
You’re preliminary score was very promising, as long as you make this your priority&nbsp;—

---

## CISCO:
That was a one-day thing.

---

I don’t know if it was luck, good energy,
Maybe my mom is really good at praying,

---
But the Cisco who got that score isn’t me.

---

## ALEX:
…
Well
There’s always National Hispanic Scholar to shoot for.

---

Your scores are definitely within the range.

---

## CISCO:
…Right.

---

## ALEX:
Look, this is the hard part.

---

You put in the hours, and then this paves the way for a nice resume, a nice college acceptance, and it’s all worth it.

---

Work now, pay off later.

---

But you need to be working.

---

## CISCO:
So it gets easier?

---

## MELISSA:
I need help.

---

## ALEX:
Melissa, we’re&nbsp;—

---

## MELISSA:
I’ve been doing everything, everything.

---

Eating dinner, waiting for the bus, can’t sleep, I study.

---

I don’t know what I’m doing wrong.

---

## ALEX:
You’re burnt out, why don’t you put the workbooks down for a couple hours&nbsp;—

---

## MELISSA:
I’m not burnt out.

---

I’m lost.

---

I need extra help.

---

I need whatever you’re doing with Cisco.

---

## ALEX:
Your scores are National Merit scores, Melissa, two weeks in a row.

---

## MELISSA:
I cheated.

---

## CISCO:
Oh shit

---

## ALEX:
Cisco, why don’t you check your answers while I talk to Melissa.

---

## MELISSA:
All of them.

---

I cheated.

---

## ALEX:
There’s no way you cheated without me noticing, there are only six of you and I’m in the room the whole time.

---

## MELISSA:
Unless I’ve taken the test before.

---

I’ve gone through every PSAT and SAT book and I finally found the one you use for practice exams.

---

## ALEX:
Melissa…
I know your first practice test was tough&nbsp;—

---

## MELISSA:
I got a 1250 on the first practice exam.

---

A 1250.

---

## CISCO:
You brought the average down?

---

## ALEX:
Cisco.

---

## MELISSA:
And I just don’t understand how I’m not improving.

---

You’re supposed to be the best.

---

I fought to be in this class because you got results&nbsp;—

---

## ALEX:
I can’t help you if I don’t know you’re struggling.

---

By being dishonest, you’ve completely sabotaged the process for&nbsp;—

---

## MELISSA:
I took the PSAT my freshman year and didn’t even get a score that low, 

---

and now suddenly I can’t break 1300, let alone 14 or 1500, which is where I should be if I even want a shot at Merit.

---


It feels like a death sentence to see a score like that on an official practice exam I can’t be&nbsp;—
I’m not.

---

That Person.

---

The 1250 person.

---


So I just took practice tests at home and every time I would go through the answers it was torture

---
My pen was just like

---

Slash slash slash slash slash slash
Red slashes all over every book

---
And I can’t do that I cannot do that
In front. Of.

---

E v e r y o n e.

---


It makes that sound.

---


You know the sound.
[Sound of slashing.]

---

## MELISSA:
And again
[Sound of slashing.]

---

## MELISSA:
And again.

---

## ALEX:              
Melissa, that’s enough.

---

## MELISSA:
And again and again and again and again

---

[Sound of slashing pen on paper]

---

## ALEX:
Melissa!

---

## MELISSA:
Please


---

## JENNY:
Y      E     S     Y E S !!!!!
YEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSS

YES YES YES YES
YESYESYESYES
YES

yeeeeesSSSSS

## JENNY:
Yes

Yes 


---

Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes

---

Yes
Y
Y
Yyyyyy……

---

## YASH:
So this is where you are every day?

---

For three full hours?

---

## ARIANA:
My mom can’t know I stopped going.

---

Plus it’s nice, quiet.

---

How long is your break?

---

## YASH:
Ten minutes I think?

---

But I don’t wanna go back.

---

Things are so awkward now and
And I know it’s like So Stupid to give Jax that
Like

---

Give him PSAT and the science hallway after third period and the third row of the parking lot 

---
If I were stronger and like
I don’t know just

---

More in my skin or whatever
I guess I would fuck it, you know

---
Just go to those places too, it’s not like he Owned those places,

---

But
He kind of did own them?

---

I don’t know
Whatever
I’m thinking I’ll just apologize.

---

Tell him I was stressed or something.

---

## ARIANA:
…
That’s it?

---

## YASH:
You have no idea how much of a game changer having Jax is

---

He’s the reason I got to switch to Mrs. Velazquez for my college counselor.

---

Mrs. Velazquez.

---

She got Danny Tucker into Georgetown and he never even
got all his math credits.

---

If you met his mom you’d totally get it, Janet has like.

---

A team.

---

But for like, his life.

---

## ARIANA:
So you’re just gonna hide behind the shiny shield of a white man?

---

## YASH:
Okay no.

---

No.

Nope.

---

You don’t get to say that.

---

I hate to break it to you but

---

## ARIANA:
I know I’m white, Yash, I’m just saying&nbsp;—

---

## YASH:
Like this whole rebellious thing you have going on?

---

 
Having beef with the teacher…

---

## ARIANA:
I do not have beef with Alex

---

## YASH:
When Eddy Lopez talked shit about some faculty on twitter he got expelled.

---

 
And here you are, you’re not even struggling in class that much&nbsp;—

---

## ARIANA:
It’s not about whether I’m struggling, it’s it's

---

## YASH:
You literally got a perfect score&nbsp;—

---

## ARIANA:
It's the way they’re feeding us this story about the test&nbsp;—

---

## YASH:
Ooooh look at me, I am very mysterious and I’m raising my hand because I have soooo many thoughts

## ARIANA:
They make it this huge deal but this test doesn't even matter!

---

## YASH:
It’s the the the,
Audacity that you walk around with

---

## ARIANA:
Audacity?

---

## YASH:
Audacity

---

## ARIANA:
Audacity!

---

## YASH:
AAAuuuuudddAAccciitttYYY

---

## ARIANA:
AUdaciTY Audacityaudacityaudacity

---

## YASH:
AuDAcity AUdacity AudacITy Audacityaudacity

---

## ARIANA:
AUUUUDDAAAACCIITTYYY

---

## YASH:
AAAUDDACIITYYY

---

## BOTH:
AAAAUUUUUDDAAAAACIIIIIITTYYYYYYYYYYYYY

---

## ARIANA:
…we are so fucking high.

---

## ARIANA: 
Wouldn’t you do it too?

---

## YASH:
What?

---

## ARIANA:
If you could fucking lash out and get away with it

---
If you couldn’t even make sense of life anymore because 

---

## ARIANA: 
Suddenly there’s this, like

---
Big Fucking Hole, and you have to walk around every day like 

---

Oh it’s fine! This Big Fucking Hole here?

---

Totally normal! Just a part of me now!
Wouldn’t you just
Fuck it!

---

## ARIANA:
And now
Now Principal Hughes wants to start a scholarship in Ian’s name.

---

Like...

---

seriously?

---

He sees that I’m angry, he sees that I transferred

---
And he thinks bringing more people to Westbrook is the answer?

---


I told him: you want to “honor my brother”?

---

## ARIANA:
Actually stop and think about what happened, what’s been happening.

---

Actually do something with the money before sucking more people into this fucked New England wannabe nightmare!

---

I mentioned Connor Davis, Chrissy Torres, Zack Chang, Hale Roberts, Lenny from sophomore year…

---

I talked about how no one even knew it was suicide with Hale for, like, three months…

---

He said I’m “likely clouded by my emotions” 
---
and he’d love to “circle back to it once I’ve had space."

---

You know, I never noticed how much people talk about death at this school before

---
It’s always so casual.

---

Jokes.

---


How we want to die, how we aren’t sleeping
Then suddenly it was all I could hear.

---

I couldn’t do it anymore.

---


After this is all over, I hope I never come back.

---

## JAX: 
Bye bye Miss 1250.

---

## YASH:
Jax, don’t&nbsp;—

---

## MELISSA:
What did you just say?

---

## JAX:
I can respect that as a first score.

---

Start low, you can only get higher, right?

---

## MELISSA: 
You told him?

---

## CISCO:
I 
Well, I&nbsp;—

---

## MELISSA:
That was a private conversation!

---

## CISCO:
I have to go.

---

## CAMILA:
Cisco, are you serious?!

---

## CISCO:
The debate club has a lot of swaying power at Westbrook.

---

I could use their endorsement.

---

## CAMILA:
Oh my god.

---

## CISCO:
I need the presidency for college apps so…I kind of felt like I had to.

---

## MELISSA:
Right.

---

Anything for college apps.

---

## CAMILA:
I know this campaign is “important to you,” but c’mon, Cisco, it’s Jax&nbsp;—

---

## CISCO: 
I asked for your help, I asked you to look into endorsements from your clubs, 
---
and you didn’t do anything.

---

## CAMILA:
Since when do you need endorsements for a class president&nbsp;—

---

## CISCO:
What is your problem with my campaign, Camila?

---

## CAMILA:
I don’t have a problem with your campaign&nbsp;—

---

## CISCO:
Because it’s one thing to have a test to study for every time I need help putting up posters at seven AM,

---

## CAMILA:
I actually did have a test to study for

---

## CISCO:
And it’s another thing to not even answer my texts&nbsp;—

---

## CAMILA:
It’s your campaign.

---

Why do I have to be so involved&nbsp;—

---

## CISCO:
Because you’re my friend.

---

Because I want this and this is hard&nbsp;—

---

## CAMILA:
Then do something hard! Do something hard for once in your life 

---

instead of begging me to move the fucking earth around just so you don’t have to think for two extra seconds! 

---

## CISCO:
I am trying&nbsp;—

---

## CAMILA:
You complain about not having something to put on your college resume, 
---
you complain about needing extra prep sessions, 

---

but the minute you go to do something yourself, 
---
you can’t even do it without a second opinion on your campaign font.

---

## CISCO:
Who picked up the phone when you were freaking out about getting into that summer program?

---

Who distracted Ms. G for fifteen minutes so she wouldn’t notice you were late?

---

## CAMILA:
I never asked you to do that&nbsp;—

---

## CISCO:
Friends help each other, Camila, that’s what they do&nbsp;—

---

## CAMILA:
All those people, all those Westbrook people who can’t go a minute without thinking about leadership positions, 
---
who are tight and rigid and boring—

---

## CISCO:
Wait a second, 

---

## CAMILA:
You don’t have to be one of those people&nbsp;—

---

## CISCO:
aren’t you the one staying up until four AM doing linear equations?

---

You hate science, you’re not even gonna do science, but you’re putting yourself through AP chem, why?

---

Because “three APs isn’t enough”?

---

## CAMILA:
Do you think I like doing this?

---

I haven’t slept more than four hours a night since the semester started.

---

I can’t keep track of anything anymore, 
---
every day I want to rip this fucking uniform off 
my skin, 

---

it feels like I’m living class period by class period&nbsp;—

---

## CISCO:
And you did that all to yourself&nbsp;—

---

## CAMILA:
You want to talk about what friends do?

---

How about ask me how I am every once in a while?

---

## CISCO:
I can’t ask how are you if we’re barely hanging out&nbsp;—

---

## CAMILA:
You of all people know how stupid I felt when I first got to Westbrook.

---

You know how much it means that I’m finally climbing up the class rankings&nbsp;—

---

## CISCO:
What would happen if you failed a class?

---

Dropped out of honor society?

---

Not to your class ranking,
To the fucking equilibrium of your life.

---

You could fail the entire grade and your parents would still be so proud of you&nbsp;—

---

## CAMILA:
Your parents are proud of you too.

---

They love you&nbsp;—

---

## CISCO:
They love the hypothetical version of me that’ll show up when I “Find God."

---

## CAMILA:
I’m sure that’s not actually how they feel&nbsp;—

---

## CISCO:
God I hate when you do that!
“Oh, Cisco, that’s not how they feel”

---
“I’m sure it’s fine”
What if it’s not fine, Camila?

---

 
What if it’s just.

---

NOT
You’re so stuck in your happy little bubble you can’t even&nbsp;—

---

## CAMILA:
You know my parents put pressure on me too&nbsp;—

---

## CISCO:
They put pressure on you because they believe in you.

---

Not because you have to make up for who you are.

---

My parents were so happy when I told them about my campaign.

---

 
My dad’s actually talking to me.

---

He calls me “El Presidente” every time he sees me now, 
---
I finally feel like we all care about something, together.

---

And I can't even tell my best friend about it.

---

## CISCO:
I guess I just wish you thought about how things are different for me.

---

[Organ plays]

---

## CAMILA:
Hi.

---

Um.

---

 
My parents say that I’m driving myself crazy and my bad mood means I’m disconnected from you or something?

---

Which, honestly makes me so angry because
I don’t know

---
I thought this is what they wanted?

---

 
I thought I was doing so well, I started working harder and I felt…smarter.

---

And capable.

---

And Good.

---

I got So Good.

---

 
And it felt like I was worth being at Westbrook and then….

---

I don’t really know what happened.

---

 
Suddenly Cisco and I aren’t FaceTiming every night anymore.

---

And I’m not even with my friends at lunch because I’m in the library working on calc homework, 

---

and I forget to pick up my own sister from school because I can't stop worrying about PSAT.

---

It’s like all these things, all these Good things just keeping pouring and pouring into me 
---
until I’m filled to the brim 

---

and I’m spilling and spilling and spilling and there’s nothing left.

---

There’s nothing left of me to give anymore.

---

I’ve been thinking a lot about why people would wanna die?

---

And I don’t know if I can ever really understand that but

---

Sometimes I just want to disappear for, like, one second?

---

Or, like, a Day
Nothing permanent, no grave just

---
One Day, you know?

---

## ALEX:
Cisco, where have you been?

---

## CAMILA:
Hey

---

## ALEX:
What happened, Cisco?

---

## CAMILA:
Someone drew over his campaign posters.

---

And it’s….

---

bad.

---

## ALEX:
Bad?

---

## YASH:
I think someone sent me a picture, hold on

---

## YASH:
Oh, yeah, that’s, I probably shouldn’t, I guess we shouldn’t give it power, 
---
I mean you don’t have to see it&nbsp;—

---

## CISCO:
Just show it to him, Yash.

---

## CAMILA:
I always knew Megan was a bitch.

---

## MELISSA:
How do you know it was Megan?

---

## CAMILA:
Who else would it be?

---

She was in the lead, and then Cisco comes in, 
---
takes half her potential votes in the last three days&nbsp;—

---

## MELISSA:
Megan isn’t like that

---

## CAMILA:
You don’t know what anyone is like until getting into an Ivy is on the line.

---

## MELISSA:
Megan doesn’t even want to go to an Ivy.

---

Her top choice is Duke.

---

## YASH:
Megan can Suke my Duke.

---

## ALEX:
Has anyone reported this?

---

## CAMILA:
See?

---

Even Alex thinks you should tell admin.

---

## CISCO:
No point.

---

## CAMILA:
It’s not fair that she got away with it AND won the presidency.

---

## CISCO:
I thought you didn’t care about me running for president.

---

## CAMILA:
You’re really gonna let that white bitch get away with this?

---

## CISCO:
You know just as much as I do that if my parents found out about this I’m dead.

---

Dicks in my mouth?

---

They’d die.

---

## YASH:
Woah.

---

It’s hitting me how, like, aggressively homophobic the poster is.

---

## MELISSA:
It’s not necessarily homophobic.

---

Penises are a common way to&nbsp;—

---

## CAMILA:
It was homophobic as fuck, I don’t care if Megan’s your friend, 
---
I want her burned at the stake.

---

## MELISSA:
She’s not my friend.

---

## JAX:
So messed up, like incredibly messed up, 

---

like I definitely would never ever condone anyone doing that ever
---
 and I’m so so sorry, Cisco, I really am.

---

But I gotta say
Whoever did that can DRAW

---

## ALEX:
Okay, that’s enough.

---

## ALEX:
I’m sorry to hear that happened, Cisco.

---

If you do decide to do something about this 
---
and you need an adult on your side, I’m here.

---

## ARIANA:
…

What?

---

## ALEX:
Ariana.

---

Happy to see you back.

---

Why don’t you take a seat?

---

## ALEX:
Yes, Ariana?

---

## ARIANA:
Um.

I think I figured out what was going one with number sixteen.

---

From the last practice test I took.

---

Basically any time you have a question that’s worded like this, 
---
nine times out of ten there’s always gonna be two answers that feel possible.

---

What I find works to eliminate the wrong one is 
---
taking a look at the first and last paragraphs&nbsp;—

---

that’s usually where the author’s perspective 
---
will most clearly and unambiguously be stated.

---

Even if other interpretations are possible.

---

And if you look at the example question on page fifty-six.

---

## ARIANA:
That’s basically what they’re pointing out.

---

## YASH:
It’s just steps.

---

## ARIANA:
It’s just steps.

---

Totally still not critical reading
And I still think it’s stupid but

---

I know it’s useful to know how Specifically Stupid it is.

---

## ALEX:
Thank you, Ariana.

---

I’m sure that clarified things for a lot of us.

---

## CISCO:
You.

---


Cutthroat, nasty, two-faced bitch!

---

## YASH:
Woah

---

## JENNY:
Cisco, this is a not a space for aggressive language&nbsp;—

---

## CISCO:
You ruined my posters! You cost me the election!

---

## CAMILA:
It was Melissa?!?

---

## MELISSA:
What?

---

## CISCO:
Don’t lie.

---

## MELISSA:
I’m not.

---

## CISCO:
Draw a dick.

---

## MELISSA:
What?

---

## CISCO:
If those dicks on my poster weren’t yours then let me see your dick.

---

## JENNY:
Why don’t we all take a breath and try using our communication skills to work out&nbsp;—

---

## MELISSA:
Who told you it was me?

---

## CISCO:
Well, Jax said&nbsp;—

---

## MELISSA:
What?

---

How did you know?

---

## JAX: 
I didn’t! 

---

I just figured since there was literally sharpie all over your right wrist

---

and only someone in AP Art would draw dicks with that much attention to detail.

---

## CISCO:
You lied.

---

To my face.

---

## MELISSA:
Cisco, I promise it was just a heat-of-the moment thing.

---

I didn’t mean to be homophobic, it didn’t even cross my mind.

---

You spilled my score to Jax and I felt horrible, 
---
I mean that score was just embarrassing and I, I, I would’ve told you.

---

I would’ve confessed if Jax hadn’t spilled.

---

All he wants to do is start drama.

---

## JAX:
You drew on the posters, you did that.

---

You think it’s not fair because you’re always getting away with things…

---

## MELISSA:
I get away with things?

---

Me?
!?

---


God are you not sick of fulfilling every single rich asshole stereotype?!

---

## JENNY:
Guys Alex will be back any second&nbsp;—

---

## ARIANA:
I’ll be auditioning for the summer intensive.

---


And I’ll be playing Mozart’s Sonata No. 1 in C.

[Piano music]

---

## JAX:
Last I checked your parents were also paying twenty grand a year for you to go to Westbrook 
---
so don’t pretend we’re that different.

---

## MELISSA:
Last I checked I was on an academic scholarship 
---
because they actually value my presence at Westbrook.

---

## JAX:
Oh, sorry, only ten grand then.

---

## MELISSA:
Fuck off, Jax.

---

## JENNY:
Language!

---

## CISCO:
God, I’m so sick of this! I’m trying to confront Melissa here 
---
and all you guys do is bicker like an old couple again!

---

## JENNY:
You all are supposed to be a team! Let’s be a TEAM! WOOO!!!

---

## JAX:
You know now that you mention it, Francisco, 

---

## CISCO:
Okay you are not allowed to call me that.

---

## JAX:
It does kind of feel like….

---

Melissa’s in love with me.

---

## JAX:
She’s always got something to say about every conversation I’m a part of, 
---
so she’s clearly always listening to me&nbsp;—


---

## MELISSA:
In love with you?

---

## YASH:
Jax, I don’t think it’s adding up for me.

---

## MELISSA:
In love with you?!

---

## YASH:
OKAY WOAH

---

## JAX:
Hey! HEY
WHAT THE HELL

---

## JENNY:
Why don’t we try some breathing exercises?

---

## CISCO:
She is strong fuck

---

## JAX:
WHAT THE HELL MELISSA
PSYCHO YOURE A PSYCHO

---

## MELISSA:
CAMILA: HELP

---

## CAMILA:
I don’t help people who sabotage my best friend

---

## JENNY:
THIS ENERGY WILL NOT BE USEFUL AS WE APPROACH TESTING DAY

---

## JAX:
OW
WHAT THE FUCK

---

## JENNY:
I’m getting Alex!

---

## JAX:
YASH: DO SOMETHING

---

## YASH:
IM NOT GETING INVOLVED

---

[Sound of the wrong piano note, then silence; piano music tentatively picks up]

---

## MELISSA:
Put down the poster.

---

[Another wrong note on the piano]

---

## MELISSA:
Put it down.

---

[Piano music picks up]

---

## MELISSA:
I will cut you with this poster, Jax Wilson

---

[Piano music stops]

## ARIANA:
Thank you.

---

[Jax laughs]

---

## CAMILA:
No one else is laughing, Jax.

---

## JAX:
God, it’s so funny.

---

Like, really?

---

All this craziness, why?

---

Because National Merit is on the line?

---


Do you actually think getting or not getting Merit is gonna make a difference in our lives?

---

We’re basically being spoon-fed the secrets to the test, 

---

and if we don’t do well on this we make sure we do well on the SAT

---

and if we don’t do well on that, we pay someone to write us some killer Common App essays 
---
and beef up our resumes and it’s all good.

---

If anyone’s realized this is all bullshit it’s gotta be us, right?

---

## CAMILA:
Step back, Melissa.

---

My turn.

---

## JAX:
OKAY OKAY

---

## ALEX:
What’s going on?!

---

What happened to the poster?

---

## ALEX:
Can someone please tell me what happened to the poster?

---

## ALEX:
Okay, we’re done for the day.

---

## MELISSA:
But the test is in two days.

---

## ALEX:
We’re done.

---

## JENNY:
So, since we didn’t get to everything today that leaves&nbsp;—

---

## ALEX:
I don’t think they need anymore lessons.

---

## JENNY: 
But&nbsp;—

---

## ALEX:
We don’t need to go over parabolas, sometimes they’re not even on the test.

---

It’s more important we focus on something that we know actually increases scores&nbsp;—confidence.

---

And that’s what you’re here for.

---

## JENNY:
…what?

---

## ALEX:
You said you wanted to focus on more than just the test right?

---

“Increase morale”?

---

## JENNY:
Yeah...

---

yeah I guess I did say that.

---

## ALEX:
So that’s what you’re gonna do.

---

Tomorrow.

---

You can say a few words, maybe lead a discussion, or do some sort of activity.

---

That would be cool.

---

Like a motivating activity.

---

Something to really get them hungry for the test.

---

## JENNY:
…Okay.

---

## ALEX:
Great.

---

## JENNY: 
Yeah! WOOO!!! Can’t Wait! It’s gonna be&nbsp;—

---

## JENNY: 
Hi everyone! Um

---

So today I’m going to be leading an activity! 
A motivating activity actually 

---

Because, as you know, obviously, the test is tomorrow

Scary! Aaah

---

Well
Actually no, not

---

I don’t want to scare you guys, that's not

---

That’s actually the opposite of what I want to do right now hahahaha

---

Anyway! 
Uhh
Why don’t we…

---

## JENNY:
Pass these around.

---

## CAMILA:
We’re making flash cards?

---

Isn’t it too late for that?

---

## JENNY: 
Nope! Not flash cards! Why don’t you all pull out a pen or pencil 
---
and I’ll explain the activity once everyone’s ready?

---

## MELISSA:
I already have my pencil out.

---

## YASH:
Me too.

---

## CISCO:
Same.

---

## ARIANA:
Yeah, I think we all do.

---

## JENNY:
Oh! Okay, well then, um.

---

Everyone close your eyes.

---

## JENNY:
I want you guys to think about…
The first day of class.

---

And what you were thinking.

---

How were you feeling?

---

At the very beginning.

---

What brought you in for that very first day?

---

Why do you want to be a National Merit Scholar?

---

## MELISSA:
Can we open our eyes now?

---

## JENNY:
Yes yes open your eyes! 
I want you all to write your answer to the question on your index card.

---

## JENNY:
Cool.

---

Awesome.

---

Thanks, guys.

---

And now we’re gonna go around the room.

---

And we’re gonna read them out loud.

---

No responses, no comments.

---

Just…listen to each other. 

---

Who wants to start?

---

## ALEX:
C’mon.

---

If no one volunteers I’ll call out people myself.

---

## JAX:
I can go.

---

## JENNY:
Yay! Take it away, Jax.

---

Why do you want to be a National Merit Scholar?

---

## JAX:
I put: to show I’m capable of more than people think.

---

## JENNY:
That’s great, Jax.

---

Why don’t you pick someone to go next?

---

## JAX:
Sure…Camila.

---

## CAMILA:
I want to know that I can set a goal and achieve it.

---

Cisco. 

---

## CISCO:
Make my family proud.

---


Yash.

---

## YASH:
I wrote down: to feel more confident in myself.

---

 
Ariana.

---

## ARIANA:
To feel like a normal student again.

---


Melissa.

---

## MELISSA:
Um, I put&nbsp;—

---

## CAMILA, CISCO, YASH, & JAX:
Yale.

---

## MELISSA:
Oh my god that was

---

## MELISSA:
That was crazy!

---

## MELISSA:
Right on cue.

---


Oh my god I&nbsp;—
I must be so tired because like
I didn’t even think?

---

Of Yale?

---

What I actually put was um.

---


It’s actually so embarrassing now that I remember the actual answer is Yale.

---

Duh.

---

 
But um.

---

 
I actually put “To Feel Like I Deserve To Be Here”
But yeah I guess.

---

Yeah.

---

 
I did start 
Doing This
I mean it’s the reason I do Anything, basically.

---


For Yale
So, yeah.

---

 
Yale.

---


Yale is the real answer.

---

## ALEX:
Sorry I’m a little jittery this morning.

---

Big Day!

---

## ALEX:
If they started on time they should be on the last section already…

---

I have been thinking, maybe, since the program is over a decade old, 
---
we could discuss some changes?

---

 
I know you always say at the end of the day they’re customers.

---

“What they’ll remember the most is whether they got what they wanted”

---

But they also remember the experience.

---

They look back and it’s more than just how much faster they could do algebra, 
---
it’s about what they learned about themselves and their confidence.

---

You Can Do It, right?

---

 
But right now it feels like I’m just gonna be the guy who tortured them for four weeks for a test 

---

that they’ll probably forget by the time they’re in their thirties 
---
fumbling their way through a meeting with their boss

---

## ALEX:
I guess I don’t know what I want to discuss, but I feel like there’s something to discuss.

---

And I’m sorry if this is So Stupid, I know at the end of the day you know what’s best, 
---
that’s why you’re the man on the poster, right?

---

 
But
Being in High School isn’t just Being in High School.

---

I think we have a chance to see these kids, 
---
actually see them, as more than jut scores. 

---

These kids,
They’re Tired.

---


And maybe we won’t see it at first, but I think this could set us apart, 
---
it could be revolutionary to&nbsp;—

---

Yes right, Sorry I&nbsp;—

Yes but&nbsp;—

---

Yes I agree but&nbsp;—

“The results,” yes I know&nbsp;—

---

That’s fair, yes
Yes

---

Let’s wait for the scores and let the results speak for themselves first…

---

No, No, nothing 
I’m just afraid they might do amazing.

---

## ARIANA:
Melissa?

---

## MELISSA:
…

What are you doing here?

---

## ARIANA:
My notebook.

---

I think I left it here.

---


What did you think of the test?

---

## MELISSA:
I don’t want to talk about the test.

---

## ARIANA:
Oh.

---


Um, my notebook…I actually think it’s under that desk you’re sitting in so

---

## ARIANA:
Um.

---

I guess I’ll just

---

## ARIANA:
Sorry I&nbsp;—
I can go now.

---

## ARIANA:
If you ever do want to talk about the test.

---

Or not the test but…how you're feeling about the test I…I’m here.

---

I kind of know how you’re feeling so&nbsp;—

---

## MELISSA:
You got a perfect score our second practice test.

---


You have no idea how I’m feeling.

---

## ARIANA:
Right, I mean um

---

## MELISSA:
There were parabolas all over that test.

---

We didn’t even go over those.

---

## ARIANA:
…

yeah…

---

## MELISSA:
I wanted it so bad.

---

How am I supposed want anything again?

---

## ARIANA:
I totally blew this audition the other day?

---


Um
You’re actually the first person I’m telling so

---

## MELISSA:
A school play is not on the same level as the PSAT.

---

## ARIANA:
Not a school play, it was for a piano program
For a scholarship.

---


And sometimes if you go to the program they let you into the school after.

---

And, I guess that was part of the plan.

---

But now the plan is gone.

---

And it’s like, I don’t know
Piano used to be so fun, you know

---

When I first started I didn’t even know if I sounded good 
---
I just knew it felt good.

---

And now I’m too busy obsessing over whether it sounds good,

---

And then I do all this test prep stuff and it’s like,
---
it all comes natural and I don’t even have to think and 

---

And it’s like, fuck, why can’t I be this way for the thing I actually care about?

---


That used to be piano.

---

I don’t know when that stopped.

---

## MELISSA:
I don’t know when loving school stopped.

---


I used to love school, like, love it.

---


I remember running to my dad after school, 
---
so excited to tell him everything I learned that day.

---


He’d test me the day before my social studies quizzes

---

And it felt amazing to give all the right answers.

---

Now it feels like all I’m really learning to do is…

---

work?

---

And.

---

Trust that it’ll all be worth it?

---

Like there’s some kind of trade for missing the homecoming dance to study, 

---

or spending my Friday nights alone, 

---

or not being able to watch a teen movie without feeling nauseous about how much I can’t relate to it.

---

But now it feels like there’s
A Whole Timeline 
---
where there is no trade and no matter how much I work 

---

Everything Still Goes Wrong.

---


But then let’s say it all does go right, you know

---

It really does pay off, it’s the Perfect Timeline 
---
and I go to a good school, 

---

and it’s Yale, probably, 

---

and I work really hard and build up another resume and start another set of applications 
---
because after undergrad there’s law school and after law school there’s Work

---

Now it’s time for Real Work, the Work We’ve Been Waiting For

---

And this is the part where I drive myself crazy because

---

When do I get to just
Live My Life?

---


Is it even worth it anymore?

---

Do I Stop?

---


Do I start over and build up this whole new identity for myself?

---

Because that just feels like even more work and
I’m not sure I even trust myself enough to stop.

---

So.

---

I guess I’m just gonna keep working and keep hoping that this is at least a medium good timeline?

---

And I’ll get some sort of trade?

---

## MELISSA:
What are you&nbsp;—?

---

## MELISSA:
…I don’t know, I should probably&nbsp;—

---

## ARIANA:
Just five minutes.

---

## MELISSA:
…Okay.

---

[The patter of rain.]

[Melissa and Ariana exhale.]
