## WEEZIE:
Hello?

---

## ANNIE:
Hi! 

Hey Aunt Weezie&nbsp;—

---

## WEEZIE:
Annie, Annie, Annie, oh my goodness, Annie…

---

Gosh, it’s so sad, it’s just&nbsp;— she fought so hard, ya know? But now she can rest. That’s her reward. And I know she was scared of dying, but now she’s not scared cause she’s um… 

---

Cause she’s dead and&nbsp;— Oh! Do you have room in the fridge for these? These bones?

---

## ANNIE:
Bones?
	
	 

---

## WEEZIE:
Well, I’m so dumb. I mean I should be euthanized. Truly, cause I &nbsp;—. 

---

So, this morning I took the doggies to the Hollow for our agility training, and on the way back we stopped at Lehr’s to pick up some bones  and when I &nbsp;—

---

## ANNIE:
Bones?

---

## WEEZIE:
– when I dropped the dogs at home, I said to myself, 

---

I said, “Weezie, don’t forget to take the bones out of the car, don’t you dare forget you fat piece of shit.” 

---

Cause they start to smell? Real fast, so you don’t wanna&nbsp;—. But of course I forgot cause I’m impaired! 

---

Like one of those Zika brain babies, which&nbsp;— oh that’s so sad but OH MY GOD are these those rosemary almonds?! 
Oh these are so good. 

---

Mmmm I haven’t eaten today. Well&nbsp;— I had an Egg McMuffin on the way to the Hollow. Only one. Which I never do. I normally keep granola in the&nbsp;— But I was fresh out  …

---

## ANNIE: 
Oh, darn.

---

## WEEZIE:
So I just gobbled it down like a fat piggie. A li’l oinker…	
	
A fucking HOG.

---

## ANNIE:
You’re not a hog.

---

## WEEZIE:
But that’s all I had, which really isn’t enough, but&nbsp;—

---

But Annie, I think this idea of yours is so great. I think it’s such a great idea for us to get together and write the eulogy. It’s really…smart and special. 

---

## ANNIE:
Oh good! Yeah, I&nbsp;—

---

## WEEZIE:
And I’ve got so many stories about your mom, stories that nobody else&nbsp;— Not even the other sisters and I know&nbsp;— 

---

you know&nbsp;— there were some rough years but I just loved her so much and I know she loved me and God she loved you, and your brothers, she just lived
for you guys, you know? 

---

Oh I miss her, I just, I already miss her. 


---

How are you?

Whaddya got so far? 

---

## ANNIE:
I’m okay, I&nbsp;—

---

## ANNIE: 
Um, nothing. Nothing yet, I…couldn’t sleep last night  so I was&nbsp;—

---

## WEEZIE:
Oh I hate sleeping.

---

## ANNIE:
Totally, but&nbsp;— But I was trying to write and then the&nbsp;— the power went out?

---

## WEEZIE:
The government.

---

## ANNIE:
Yeah, and then, this sounds weird, but I kind of…felt her? 

---

## WEEZIE:
Wow…

---

## ANNIE:
Yeah! This warm, like, atom bomb of…love.

---

## WEEZIE:
Wow.

---

## ANNIE:
Yeah! And so I thought: *Okay*. This is what I need to *distill* in the&nbsp;— this feeling of&nbsp;—
Her love, you know? Cause it still feels so alive.

---

## WEEZIE:
Wow. Yeah.

---

## ANNIE: 
Yeah. Yeah but then I tried to write and I just…couldn’t think.

---

## WEEZIE:
Well, you were probably hungry. You needed a steak! Red meat. Blood. Iron. Cow.

---

## ANNIE: 
Uh-huh but that’s why I’m so happy you’re&nbsp;— That all the aunts are&nbsp;—. Cause I know you guys can. I know you’ll. You’ll help me. 

---

## WEEZIE:
Definitely. Yes. Yes.


---

## ANNIE:
Cause the job of the eulogist is really important, you know? I have to…um….

---

“… acknowledge the immensity of the loss and help everyone appreciate that the legacy of his or her loved one hasn’t died with them.”

---

## WEEZIE:
Well said. 

---

## ANNIE:
Yeah! We’ll just, um, honor the love and share stories and memories and quilt them into a…a quilt, ya know? A figurative, quilted… 

---

## WEEZIE:
Well, I didn’t know you quilted, Annie, that’s very cool of you. Very cool.


---

## ANNIE: 
Yeah! … Wait, what?

---

## WEEZIE:
Well, that’s great that you feel your mom. It’s great. Cause I do too. I really do.

---

## ANNIE:
Aww. That’s nice.

---

## WEEZIE:
Like in the forest today I…felt her? Talked to her actually. 

---

## ANNIE: 
Oh, wow. Like her…?

---

## WEEZIE:
Her spirit, yeah. Yeah, it was great. Very healing. I fuckin’ love nature. And so did your mom. So it makes sense that she was there. Waiting for me. 

---

## ANNIE:
For sure.


---

## WEEZIE:
Yeah, the forest rocks. It’s where I always go to reconnect with the&nbsp;—. And not just dead people, dead parts of my s&nbsp;— my sexuality for instance… 

---

## ANNIE:
Oh!

---

## WEEZIE:
Mm-hm! Love trees. I’m attracted to ‘em. And all humans are and it’s actually very common and it’s actually not weird  and&nbsp;—

---

## ANNIE:
Tree attraction?

---

## WEEZIE:
Yeah, it’s very normal. Called ecosexuality. My friend Mary Jane who wears a helmet&nbsp;— she told me about it. 

---

## ANNIE:
Huh.

---

## WEEZIE:
Yeah, and it doesn’t mean you wanna have sex with trees. 
Well, actually, that’s exactly what it means. For some people. But that’s not what I&nbsp;— 

---

Or maybe I do feel that way. But I&nbsp;— I actually don’t and… 
I just feel good in the woods and…and your mom did too. 

---

## ANNIE:
…That’s so great.

---

## WEEZIE:
Yeah.

---

[claps and snaps]

---

So, where your brothers? Where dem boys at?

---

## ANNIE:
Oh, it’s a long story. So, Dad and Rob are driving to UNC. To pick up Josh. He was supposed to fly, but&nbsp;—

---

## WEEZIE:
Oh, right! Cause of his “plane fear.” Jesus, poor Joshy. Does he have low T?

---

## ANNIE: 
T?

---

[Weezie's phone rings]


---

## WEEZIE:
Testosterone. Not saying there’s a connection, but&nbsp;—


---

Shit. It’s your Aunt Tucker. Dammit. 
	

---

Hey Tuck…Yep, with her now. Are you&nbsp;—…? No, I did not. Ok. Ok.
Yeah okay, Tuck! I already said&nbsp;—. I don’t know. Lemme ask. 
Annie. Do you need any turkey?

---

## ANNIE:
Um, sure!  Or, no? Or, I don’t know.

---

## WEEZIE:
She doesn’t need turkey. Yep, yep, yep okay I’m bored I’m hanging up byyye!


---

Yuck. Okay! Your Aunt Tucker’s on her way. She sounds absolutely demented. 

---

She’s having a hard time, your mom was more than a sister to her, she was like a&nbsp;— like a parent. I mean, she wiped Tucker’s ass. 

---

## ANNIE:
Right.

---

## WEEZIE:
She wiped Lizzie’s ass too. So, for the younger sisters, I think it’s just… different.

---

## ANNIE:
Sure.


I’m…happy she got to happy birthday. 

---

## WEEZIE:
Mm. Yeah…
What?

---

## ANNIE:
Sorry, I mean I’m glad she got to have her birthday. My mom. Before she died?

---

## WEEZIE:
Right. Yes. Yep, me too.

---

## ANNIE: 
Dad sent me some pictures of her little party, and she looks so joyful&nbsp;—


---

## WEEZIE:
She had a party?

---

## ANNIE: 
Yeah! Couple weeks ago. 

	

---

## WEEZIE:
That’s so fun!

---

## ANNIE:
Yeah! It was a pajama party, so they all…wore pajamas.

---

## WEEZIE:
Rad!

---

## ANNIE: 
Here, I’ll show you some… They’re really cute.

…There’s Sally…and Wendy…

---

## WEEZIE:
Wendy Hobson, I see. Yep, I grew up with all these gals…
…Aggie…Mary Pat…Thought she was still in Tulum…
	

---

Awww silly fun, well I’m glad she got to have a party. 
Speaking of parties, your mom and I had this funny idea to&nbsp;—. It’s really funny.

---

## ANNIE:
Ooo. What?

---

## WEEZIE:
Well, we always wanted to throw ourselves a joint birthday party. Like very lavish…

---

## ANNIE:
That’s fun… 

---

## WEEZIE:
Plan was, invite all the Waspiest gals, you know the type&nbsp;— Botox, racquet sports, Jewish husbands&nbsp;— 

---

and then, when they got there, we were gonna&nbsp;— this is so funny…
We were gonna poison them.  


---

## ANNIE:
…What?

---

## WEEZIE:
I mean, not really, just spike their wine with Bisacodyl. It’s a laxative. 
They would’ve shit themselves. 

---

## ANNIE:
Oh! That’s funny!

---

## WEEZIE:
I know. It would’ve been. I know.

---

## ANNIE:
But I guess I don’t&nbsp;— *sorry*, why would you do this?

---

## WEEZIE:
Well, as a gesture! To protest country clubs, or, you know, imperialism…

---

## ANNIE:
Right on, yeah. Yeah, but didn’t you and Mom belong to Green Hills? Isn’t that a&nbsp;—

---

## WEEZIE:
Well, we belonged to a country club, but we didn’t belong at a country club, you know? It’s an identity thing. 

---

Tucker and Lizzie, they belong at the country club. They fit in there. Barbara not so much, but that’s only cause she’s a Martian and a freak and a&nbsp;—

---

## ANNIE:
What about Nana?

---

## WEEZIE:
Eh. Mommy didn’t really belong anywhere. Maybe a catacomb? 
I dunno. She had afflictions. 

---

## ANNIE:
Afflictions?

---

## WEEZIE:
But yeah your mom and I were the rebels. We’d sneak out at night, ride our horses&nbsp;—throw firecrackers into Paradise pond…

	 

---

## ANNIE:
Ooo let me…write this down…


---

## WEEZIE:
Yeah, you should put that in the eulogy. How your mom and I were the free spirits. And how we never rode with saddles.
	

---

Mm. I wouldn’t mention the pond stuff.  

---

## ANNIE:
Oh. Sure.

---

## WEEZIE:
Yeah, people were…pretty mad. Cause the fireworks sorta destroyed the pond’s ecosystem. Yeah. Killed all the fish. Exploded ‘em, actually.

---

[knock at the side door]
	 

---

## TUCKER: 
Annie?

---

## ANNIE:								
Hey Aunt Tuck!						

## WEEZIE:
Hiya!

---

## TUCKER:
Heeeyyy sorry I’m late.
Hiiii. Sorry, sorry, sorry… 

---

## WEEZIE:
Hey Tuck.

---

## ANNIE:					
Hi! No, don’t be sorry. You’re not late.	

---

## TUCKER:
It’s so sad. 

---

## ANNIE:
Yeah.

---

## TUCKER:
I wasn’t expecting…– But. But she was in pain. She was hurting.

---

## ANNIE:
She was.

---

## TUCKER:
And now she can&nbsp;— I mean I know she didn’t want to but her body just… It had enough. 

---

## ANNIE:
Yeah. And she got to die at home. 

---

## WEEZIE:
That’s right. That’s what she wanted.

---

## TUCKER:
Yeah. But part of me wonders…
Yeah. Yeah. She got to die at home.
	

---

Sorry I’m late.

---

## ANNIE:
You’re not late. 

---


## TUCKER:
Oh my god you’re so thin!You’re very very thin…

---

## ANNIE:							                           
Ha. Definitely not.						    
Well, I’ve actually gained weight since fall, which is&nbsp;— 	    
But look at you! You’re so tiny!



---

## TUCKER:
Please. I’m an absolute pig. The mother of all pigs. Feel my thighs. 

---

## ANNIE:
No, stop. You’re mentally ill. 

---

## WEEZIE:
You’re both NUTS. I’m the hog king I’m like, uh, what’s-his-name…

---

## TUCKER: 
But you really do look good, Annie. A little thin, but…healthy.

---

## WEEZIE:
Bubba the Tub or Jubba Wub Bub? That fat horny slug from Star Wars?

---

## TUCKER: 
Hello, Louise. 

---

## ANNIE:
Aunt Weezie, you’re not a slug. You’re *glowing*.

---

## TUCKER: 
Yes. You look like you’ve spent the day…burying guns in the woods.

---

## WEEZIE:
Well. I appreciate that.					

---

## TUCKER:
But how are you feeling?

---

## ANNIE:								 
I’m okay. Just…sad. 						 


## WEEZIE:
I’m alright.

---

## TUCKER: 
Well, of course. God, of course. 

---

## WEEZIE:
I was training the dogs.

---

## TUCKER:
What?

---

## WEEZIE:
Huh?
---

## TUCKER:
…What did you say?

---

## WEEZIE:
That’s why I’m wearing this. The jumpsuit.

---

## TUCKER: 
Okay. 

---

But how are the boys? Oh your dad told me about Joshy’s flight. Nightmare.

	

---

## ANNIE:
Yeah…	



---

## TUCKER:
Well, they’re saints for making that drive. Poor Joshy…

---

He should probably be in therapy for the plane thing, right?

---

## ANNIE:
Yeah. Yeah he just had this bad feeling all week and then, you know, Mom died, so…

---

## TUCKER:
Right.

---

## ANNIE:
It kinda…gave power to his other bad feelings.

---

## WEEZIE:
IRRATIONAL fears. 

---

## ANNIE:
His fears. Yeah.

---

## TUCKER:
Yeah. Yeah. It’s just…sometimes you gotta take planes.

	


---

Well, my girls send their love. Ava gets in tomorrow, and Laney flew in this morning, as did I, so I had the pleasure of chauffeuring her&nbsp;— Oh, we saw three dead geese on I-75.

---

## ANNIE:								
Wait, you were out of town?

## WEEZIE:
Neat…

---

## TUCKER:
Uh-huh. Chicago. I’m doing a little piece on&nbsp;— It doesn’t matter.

---

## ANNIE:
What’s the piece?

---

## TUCKER:
Oh, it’s boring. It’s nothing. It’s not important. 

---

## WEEZIE:
You’re writing?






---

## TUCKER:
What?

---

## WEEZIE:
Huh?

---

## TUCKER:
Yes, I’m&nbsp;— I’ve been freelancing for the last 8 months, I left the firm because I want&nbsp;— and I’ve told you this countless times&nbsp;— I want to do something that actually matters.

---

## WEEZIE:
Shit that matters. Right, right, right. I remember now. 

---

## ANNIE:
Um. So, what’s the piece on?

---

## TUCKER:
Hm? Oh it’s nothing, it’s… Urban Squash? It’s this squash nonprofit for underprivileged youth. 

---

It’s really amazing and, you know, racquet sports have such an important connection with higher education. 

---

I’m actually on the board, so there’s a bias, but I acknowledge the bias, which is very Gonzo of me, and&nbsp;—

---

## WEEZIE:
Well, I think it’s so great what you do for those kids, Tuck. 

---

They would’ve never had a chance to learn squash and then you, you teach ‘em.

---

## TUCKER:
…Well, I don’t teach them.

---

## WEEZIE:
Sure you do… 

---

## TUCKER:
No. I don’t. I’m on the board. I apply for grants. 

---

## WEEZIE:
Exactly. Right.	 
	
	

---

## ANNIE:
Well. I’m just so glad you’re here. 

Um, so I was thinking.

---

## TUCKER: 
Oh Lou, I don’t…I’m trying not to.

---

## WEEZIE:
To your mom.

---

## TUCKER:
I don’t want that. 

---

## WEEZIE:
Just a tiny glass.

---

## TUCKER: 
I don’t want wine. 

---

## WEEZIE:
It’s a gesture. 

---

## TUCKER:
It’s the morning. 

---

## WEEZIE:
Just pick it up, Tuck. You don’t have to drink it. 

---

## TUCKER:
Oh shit. 

---

## ANNIE:
What?

---

## TUCKER:
I left the turkey in the car.

---

## WEEZIE:
I told you not to get the turkey!

---

## TUCKER:
Annie, do you need anything?

---

## ANNIE:
From…your car?


---

## TUCKER:
Yes.

---

## ANNIE:
I’m good, thanks. 

---

[Weezie's Phone Beeps]

---

## WEEZIE:
Sorry, lemme, um…
	
So is your boyfriend&nbsp;— uh, Hoober?

---

## ANNIE:
Ronan.

---

## WEEZIE:
Ronan. That’s right. Ronan. Is Ronan coming to the service?

---

## ANNIE:
Yeah, he flies in on Thursday. He wanted to come with me, but&nbsp;— 

---

## WEEZIE:
Aww well he’s such a prince. Very tall. And he’s a…an engineer?

---

## ANNIE:
Teacher. Yeah, we teach at the same school. So that’s fun.

---

## WEEZIE:
That *is* fun.

	

---

## ANNIE:
I’m moving into his condo, which is…*kewl*…
I kind of…don’t want to, but…maybe I…do? We’ll probably get married&nbsp;—

---

## WEEZIE:
Well, we just loved him. So tall.


---

[Weezie's phone beeps again]

---

## ANNIE:
Yeah. Super tall.

---

## WEEZIE:
Sorry, it’s my…ball and chain. 

---

## ANNIE:
Aw. How’s Uncle Larry? 

---

## WEEZIE:
Fine. Very stupid. He’s picking a pal up from the airport, but he went to the wrong…

---

…Oh and Will’s flying in on Thursday, so if Ronan needs a ride… 

	

---

## ANNIE:
Will’s coming?

---

## WEEZIE:
To the funeral? Well…*yeah* he loved your mom. 

---

## ANNIE:
…I guess I just didn’t&nbsp;—. Cause he’s been in Beijing for so long.

---

## WEEZIE:
Well, sure, but he has a telephone, I mean it’s hard with the time stuff, they’re in the future or whatever, but…he made time. She was important to him. 
	
	 

---

## ANNIE:
That’s so nice.

---

## WEEZIE:
And she was the one that convinced him to get the prenup. Jasmine didn’t want it. 

---

So your mom called him and said, “Dude, she’s gotta sign it, protect your assets, protect your ass.” 

	

---

## ANNIE:
That’s good.

---

## WEEZIE:
Jasmine was a parasite. And her hair wasn’t real! She lied about that. And that’s wrong. 

---

## ANNIE:
That’s good. Er, I mean, yeah.

---

## WEEZIE:
But now he’s with Sabina. And they seem very happy together, and that’s&nbsp;— It’s really all thanks to your mom. Have you met Sabina?

---

## ANNIE:
No. 

---

## WEEZIE:
Oh. Well she’s lovely.

---

## ANNIE:
That’s great.  
…Sorry when would I have met her?

---

## WEEZIE:
I dunno. I just couldn’t remember if you had. 

---

## ANNIE:
Haven’t.
	
	

---

## WEEZIE:
Well. Now you will.

	

---

## ANNIE:
I’m gonna pee real quick.

---

## WEEZIE:
Have fun!

---

## ANNIE:
Haha. Okay! 


## WEEZIE:
Not too much fun!

---

## ANNIE:
Sorry, what?

---

## WEEZIE:
I said don’t have too much fun. In the bathroom…
…I don’t know why I said it. 

	


	

---

## ANNIE:
Wanna hear a funny story?		   

---

## WEEZIE:
Not really in the mood.

---

## TUCKER:
Of course we do.

---

## WEEZIE:
Yeah, of course.

---

## ANNIE:
So this one time, Mom was driving us… It was me, my brothers, this kid PJ and-
 

---

## WEEZIE:
PJ Gibby? I remember that kid! I was very good friends with his mother, Julie.

---

## ANNIE:								
Uh-huh… 				        

## TUCKER:
Oh, she was a nut. She made all her own shoes.

---

## WEEZIE:
Funny story: I was actually at the hospital the day he was born. 

---

## ANNIE:							      
Oh. Why?


## TUCKER:
In the psych ward?

---

## WEEZIE:
Oh this stupid fucking Dalmatian bit my cheek but yeah I was there and&nbsp;— don’t tell PJ, but when he exited Julie’s, we all gasped because…well his penis was so tiny.

---

## ANNIE:
You were…at the birth?

## TUCKER:
Pardon?

---

## WEEZIE:
It’s called inconspicuous penis and it’s not normal. Julie was despondent, so I said, Jules, 
Ya gotta love your kids, gotta accept ‘em. 

---

Julie resented PJ for his tiny penis, refused to breastfeed. Odd woman. She had terrible seizures. Annie, did ya ever see her seizures?

---

## TUCKER:
Okay! Back to Annie's story. 

---


## ANNIE:
Oh yeah! basically, this one time, Mom told us, she convinced us that there’s a button in the back of your mouth and if you push it just right, like, your tongue comes out. 

---

## TUCKER:
Oh. Yuck. 

---

## ANNIE:
Yeah, and at first we didn’t believe her, but she… “Parents don’t want you to know cause then you’d unsnap it all the time. Drop it in the toilet, feed it to the turtle...”

---

## WEEZIE:
Ha ha. Turtles are great. 

---

## ANNIE:
So we shove our hands down our throats, and Mom’s like, “Keep going, it’s really far back,” and we’re like, “Yeah, I&nbsp;— [gags]&nbsp;— I can totally&nbsp;— [gags]   &nbsp;— feel it.” 

---

## TUCKER:
That’s funny…

---

## ANNIE:
Josh barfs. PJ barfs. I barf. Rob barfs. 

---

Mom blows a red light, cop pulls us over, sees there are multiple children covered in vomit, so he barfs 

---

and Mom’s laughing so hard, she is literally crying, she’s clutching her crotch because she’s peed herself, obviously.

---

## TUCKER:
Well, we all do that. 

---

## WEEZIE:
Not me. Not anymore. I do bladder training. Scheduled urination.	           


---

You go at fixed times during the day, and if you have to go before the fixed time, you employ the urge suppression techniques.



---

## ANNIE:
That’s cool…

---

## WEEZIE:
Yep. Mind over bladder. Take back your life. 

---

## TUCKER:
Inspiring.

---

## ANNIE:								
…But isn’t that funny? About the tongues?				 

---

## WEEZIE:
Little bit.

## TUCKER:
Yeah…

---

## ANNIE:
Should I put it in the eulogy?

---

## TUCKER:
If you want to! It’s a great story. 

---

## ANNIE:
I just…– Most funerals are boring, and I was thinking about Nana&nbsp;—

---

## WEEZIE:
Not in Tibet. They cut up your body and let birds eat it.

---

## ANNIE:
– about Nana’s funeral, how it was so cold and so impersonal, and&nbsp;—

---

## WEEZIE:
You were at the funeral?

	

---

## ANNIE:			
No, I&nbsp;— I had this retreat  thing.         
					   				 
I wanted to be there, I just…		I told you this.	          
But Dad gave me the rundown. 

## TUCKER:
I told you about her retreat.

## WEEZIE:
Oh, wait. The retreat. Right.
Yep, yep, I remember now.

---

## WEEZIE:
Well, it wasn’t that impersonal. Your cousin Magnus sang a lovely original song. 

---

## TUCKER:
It was not original. It was “Candle in the Wind.” 

---

## WEEZIE:
Well, he sang it in a very original way.

---

## TUCKER:
It was menacing.

---

## WEEZIE:
He accompanied himself on the snare drum. 

---

## ANNIE:
Oh, that’s… Was it affecting?

---

## WEEZIE:
It was. The steady beat of it…

## TUCKER:
No.
	


---

## TUCKER:
Like a military execution.

---

## WEEZIE:
It was wonderful.

---

## TUCKER:
Like being marched to the gallows. *Disturbing*.

---

## WEEZIE:						
I loved it.	

---

## ANNIE:
Well. I should’ve been there. Was I, like, the only one who wasn’t there?
							


---

## TUCKER: 
Your Aunt Barbara did not attend.

---

## ANNIE:
She didn’t?!

---

## TUCKER:
No. She had a work conflict. 

---

## WEEZIE:
Some Martian ceremony. 

---

## TUCKER:
Nope, that’s not a thing. It was a normal party to celebrate her promotion.

---

## WEEZIE:
God, that was so fucked up. “Sorry I can’t make Mother’s funeral. I have to purify the *dead alien ghosts* inhabiting my body.” 

---

## TUCKER:
Can we please not?

---

## WEEZIE:
They think humans descended from traumatized clams. That is a *real* thing they believe.

---

## ANNIE:			   
Clams?	

---

## TUCKER:
Goddammit.	

---

## WEEZIE:
It’s one of their beliefs! God she is unbelievable. I can’t BELIEVE her.

---

## TUCKER:
And off the rails we go…

---

## WEEZIE:
Skipped Mom’s funeral. *Psycho*. 			
						

---

## TUCKER:
You’re hysterical. 

---

## WEEZIE:
Cult over family! Over everything. Humanity…America…

---

## TUCKER:
Okay, but technically it’s a religion, so let’s try to be respectful… 

---

## WEEZIE:
Are you insane?! It’s not a religion! The guy who started it was a blind impotent LOSER. Did you know this, Annie?

---

## ANNIE:
Uh-huh! Yeah, you sent me that book…

---

## WEEZIE:
Just a LOSER. I mean, Jim Jones, he killed all those people, but at least he was kinda *groovy*. Cool sunglasses, great hair… 

---

## TUCKER:
You’re unhinged.

---

## WEEZIE:
But t*heir* guy? What a frickin’ ding-dong, oh god it’s so HUMILIATING!

---

## TUCKER:
Lou. Please. My head. Please. 

---

## WEEZIE:
Well, it makes me mad, and lastly, and this is the last thing I’ll say: It’s really unfair that Barb’s kids had to grow up in that world&nbsp;— that planet&nbsp;— it’s&nbsp;— it’s child abuse! 

---

They never went to school, never learned about numbers or presidents&nbsp;— I don’t think they can read! 

---

## TUCKER:
Well, two of them are lawyers, but sure. *Anyway*. Annie, how’s the eulogy coming?

---

## ANNIE:
“Good morning. My mother was a beautiful dancer.”

---

## WEEZIE:
Oh god she was. So beautiful. Like a… 
Wave, wind, bird, like a&nbsp;— Native American…			
…Like a scarf or……	

---


But back to Barbie’s kids&nbsp;—						……
Your mom tried, she really tried to help your cousins.


---

Always invited them to the beach house…
And Barb always said no. 



---

## TUCKER: 
She sent them to summer camp. 

---

## WEEZIE:
It was a *ranch* where they did hard labor. No supervision. Like Lord of the frickin’ Rings. 

---

## ANNIE:							     
How’d you&nbsp;— Aunt Barbie told you this?

## TUCKER:
***Flies***.

---

## WEEZIE:
No! Barb was all: La-de-dah, the kids are greaaat! Meconium is show jumping with the Spielbergs!

---

## TUCKER:
No one is named Meconium, Louise.

---

## WEEZIE:
You could never trust Barb to tell ya the truth about her kids. I mean, I only know about the ranch cause Arlo and Will were pen pals so…you know…he spilled some shit. 

	


---

## TUCKER:
Lizzie left me a voicemail. I’m just gonna see…
Go pee, Lou.

---

## WEEZIE:
Can’t. Haven’t reached my voiding interval. 

---

## TUCKER:								
Jesus, she sounds deranged. She’s just babbling about salmon. 

---

## WEEZIE:
Just fifteen minutes
	
											

---

## TUCKER:									
What is she talking about?! She has rats in her brain…
				

---

## WEEZIE:
maybe it’s thirty.

---

## TUCKER:
She’s free-associating. Dear God. 

---

## WEEZIE:
Mother of God…

---

## TUCKER:	        
Okay! Well, Lizzie’s flight got in early… 					    
She had a sexual nightmare on the plane… 				     


---

It involved a bird… 
She’ll be here soon.	
							

---

## ANNIE:					
Oh, I’m excited! I haven’t seen Aunt Lizzie in like…forever.		     
…She’s *great*. 

	

---

## TUCKER:
Uh-huh…

## WEEZIE:
Yeah…

---

## ANNIE:
You know what’s funny? This is so -, but when I was little, I thought she…maybe really hated me?

---

## TUCKER:
What?! Aunt Lizzie?!What?!

## WEEZIE:
Why?! Why would you think&nbsp;— 

---

## ANNIE:
I dunno. It’s stupid.  

---

## WEEZIE:
Her face just does weird stuff. It doesn’t mean anything. She got dropped a lot as a baby.

---

## ANNIE:
I just have these memories of her smiling, but like the smile had a scream underneath it? 
	
“You need to stop.”

---

## WEEZIE:
Ah, yes. The rage smile. That’s how Larry looks when I talk about ecosexuality….

---

## TUCKER:
I think you were just sensitive, honey.

---

## ANNIE:
No, I know.

## WEEZIE:
Cause it’s not having sex with trees. 

---

## TUCKER:
Lizzie adores you.


## WEEZIE:

That’s NOT what it is.


---

## ANNIE:	
No, I know. I shouldn’t…

## WEEZIE:
You’re right.
I mean, it can be that. But I don’t…
I don’t impose my sexuality on trees.
The trees just help me express my sexuality.

---

## TUCKER:
Ope! Missed some of this.

---

## WEEZIE:
And Larry’s all…
	
“Well, honey, if trees get ya wet, maybe I’ll HANG myself on one and you can finally achieve&nbsp;—”
	

---

Oh god… 
	

---

## TUCKER:
*Lou. Go to the bathroom!*

	

---

## WEEZIE:
Goddammit to hell. But I could’ve done it!

---

## TUCKER:
Run!
	
## ANNIE
Good luck!

---

## TUCKER:
Sorry. 

---

## ANNIE: 
No, she’s great. Should I hide the…?

---

## TUCKER:
Oh. No. She’ll find it. She’ll sniff it out. Like a truffle pig… 


---

This is hard for her. For all of us it’s…I mean, I don’t even know what I look like now. 


---

If your mom doesn’t exist, I don’t even… That doesn’t make sense.


---

But it’s hardest for Lou. She doesn’t have many people in her life who… Yeah.

---

## ANNIE:
Yeah.

	 

---

## TUCKER:
Sorry. Bad habit. I don’t even know that I’m&nbsp;— Richard hates it. 

---

## ANNIE: 
Mom did it too. But more like a magic trick. She’d make it disappear under her napkin.

---

## TUCKER:
Well, she was a dancer. She had an excuse. Although… Yeah.

	


---

## ANNIE:
…I keep feeling these…like flare-ups of…like I kind of feel her. You know?



---

## TUCKER:
No. 


…But I bet that feels nice.

---

## ANNIE:
Yeah. A little scary.

---

## TUCKER:
Scary? Oh, these almonds are deadly…

---

## ANNIE:
Cause I felt&nbsp;— in the last few months I sometimes felt like she was mad at me? 
For like…taking her spot? In the family. 

---

## TUCKER:
Her spot? No, she loved you to pieces. Loved you madly I need…something salty… 

---

## ANNIE:
I read her diary.

---

## TUCKER:
Oh. Okay.

---

## ANNIE:
I know that’s not…not nice, but…
I just wanted to see…
I think she was scared.

---

## TUCKER:
Oh, no, honey. She was at peace at the end. 

---

## ANNIE: 
And she talks about a&nbsp;— sometimes she calls it her shadow twin…or her Annie twin…
…I’ll find it…
	

---

“My shadow twin, my swarm of dark: Windowless, wild black, crude. My haunted place, my Annie self: Deepest part of my…” I can’t read what it - … Oh. “House.”

---

## TUCKER:
That’s okay.

---

## ANNIE:
Look at me it says I said, the terrible dark at my table 	


---

And the root of root is rot, it said
Shut the door. Roots still grew


---

Hungry as shadows, hungry as my&nbsp;—
Hungry as my my my my

	

---


Annie self, the ground down storm 
Sleeps, festers, soon to overtake, she steers me into the dark.

---

[Weezie's phone rings]

---


## TUCKER:
When your mom was little, she&nbsp;— well all of us were. Afraid. Of the dark. Even Lou…


---

But I was the only sleepwalker. I’d have these, like, night terrors while I roamed and…
Dad would flip the breaker to the 2nd floor. So it was always very dark. 


---

Sometimes I’d wake up in your mom’s bed. She’d trace these shapes onto my back… 


---

And sometimes I’d wake up and not know where I was. Or what was real…
And I…I couldn’t see…
I remember… 


---

[Doorbell rings]


---


	

JESUS CHRIST!

---

[Doorbell rings, followed by knock]
---

	

Come in! … That’s Liz. I don’t know why she doesn’t &nbsp;—


---

[Knock on door]


---


	

Oh my god. COMING!
	
	 

---

## TUCKER:
(offstage)
Hey Lizzie!

---

## LIZZIE:
(offstage)
Sorry. Hi! I didn’t know&nbsp;— I should have just walked in.

---

## TUCKER: 
Oh, wow. Look at&nbsp;— You didn’t need to buy anything. 

---

## LIZZIE: 
Sorry! I wasn’t sure if you guys had enough… I can always…

---

## TUCKER: 
No, it’s great. This is&nbsp;— Come in!

---

## LIZZIE: 
Let me take off my shoes, or&nbsp;— Is that okay?

---

## TUCKER: 				
Of course! Give me the bags. 

---

## LIZZIE:
Or I can just&nbsp;— I’ll take them off later.
Or&nbsp;— sorry, let me just&nbsp;— I’m just gonna…
No no no I got it. Sorry! Okay. Sorry.

## TUCKER:
Just. Okay. Give me the bags… 
Here, you give me those bags so you can&nbsp;—

---

## ANNIE:
Hi Aunt Lizzie!

	

---

## LIZZIE:
Hi! Sorry, let me just&nbsp;— Can I put these here?

---

## ANNIE:
Of course! 

---

## LIZZIE:
Sorry. I’ll put them in the fridge in a&nbsp;— Hi!

---

## ANNIE:
Hi! It’s so good to see you!

	

---

## LIZZIE:
You too! Or&nbsp;— I mean really sad circum&nbsp;— but. Yeah! It’s so good to&nbsp;— Gosh. Hi!
	

---

Oh, Tuck, no.  Let me do that. 

---

## TUCKER:
Stop. Sit down. 

---

## LIZZIE: 
No, no, no, we can… Here. Let me…
	
	

---

## ANNIE:
Well, this is so thoughtful.

---

## LIZZIE:
No, it’s nothing! I thought I could make a salad, and&nbsp;— I didn’t know if you liked fish.

---

## ANNIE:
Love fish!

---

## LIZZIE:
Good! I got salmon. I was trying to find some that wasn’t farm raised and the man at the counter said it was wild caught, but it’s awfully pink so who knows&nbsp;—

	

---

## TUCKER:
Jesus, Lizzie! This is expensive! 

---

## LIZZIE:
No, it’s nothing I just thought I could do a little cheese plate, I got some nuts and olives and&nbsp;— 

---

but you’re probably not&nbsp;— I mean, it’s fine if you’re not hungry, or maybe you&nbsp;—  But whatever you are is so fine and so normal 

---

and oh my gosh you’re both so tiny!

---

## ANNIE:
I’m really not.

## TUCKER:
No.

---

## LIZZIE:
You are! Teeny tiny. Like your mommy.

---

## ANNIE:
You’re tiny!

## TUCKER:
Lizzie, you’re a twig.

---

## LIZZIE:
No no no, I’m a log or a hog... a hog on a log .

---

## WEEZIE:
(offstage)
IS THAT LIZZIE?!

---

## LIZZIE:
HI LOU!
	
	

---

## WEEZIE:
Hey girl!!

---

## LIZZIE:
Heeeey! Hiiiiii! 
	
You look GREAT&nbsp;— Ooo you’re a little wet…

---

## WEEZIE:
Yeah the sink did a thing YOU look great! 

---

## TUCKER:
Look at the haul Lizzie brought!

---

## WEEZIE:
My god, Liz! You trying to fatten us for slaughter?!

---

## LIZZIE:
It’s nothing, it’s nothing, I just thought we might need some…


---

But Annie, I love your shirt, and also, how are you?

---

## ANNIE: 
I’m okay! I’m sad, but this is so nice!

---

## LIZZIE:
Of course! Sorry, I &nbsp;—

---

## ANNIE:
No, I was just&nbsp;— I’m so happy to be with all of you. 
	
	

---

## WEEZIE:
Well we are so happy to be with you.

---

## LIZZIE:
Yes!

## TUCKER:
We are.

---

## LIZZIE:
Sooo how’s the… With the writing? Is it…going well?

---

## ANNIE:
Ha. I haven’t written anything.
No, truly, I haven’t written anything.
Maybe! With your&nbsp;— with your help.					

## WEEZIE:
It’s wonderful!
It’s going to be wonderful.

---

## LIZZIE:
Of course!

## TUCKER:
Absolutely.

---

## WEEZIE:		
Well, I told you about the horses and our plan to poison those ladies…

---

## ANNIE:
Uh-huh. Yep. Yeah, and I laid out some paper. If you guys wanted to write down some thoughts or stories or feelings that come up…

---

## LIZZIE:
Definitely!

## TUCKER:
Sure!

## WEEZIE:
Oh, I got loads of horse stories.

---

## LIZZIE:
Should we…do it now?

---

## ANNIE:
Oh, no! It’s whenever you want to. *If* you want to.

---

## LIZZIE: 
Of course! Let’s&nbsp;— Yeah! Let’s…here we go…

	

---

## WEEZIE:
Does anyone want a glass of wine?

---

## TUCKER:
Definitely not.

## LIZZIE:
Oh, no thanks. But thanks!

---

## ANNIE:
…I’d have a glass.

---

## WEEZIE:
Incredible. Good girl. You’re fun. Annie’s fun.

---

## LIZZIE:
You know what? I think I&nbsp;— I’ll have one too. If that’s okay.

---

## WEEZIE:
Of course!

Sit down, Lizzie. 

---

## LIZZIE: 
No. Let me&nbsp;— cause I was gonna make a little cheese plate…
Perfect! Sorry. Perfect. Thank you…
	
	

---

## WEEZIE:
Liz, this is so great of you cause I actually&nbsp;— I forgot to eat today.

---

## LIZZIE:							
Oh no!!								

---

## ANNIE:
Except for the Egg McMuffin.

	

---

## WEEZIE:
That’s right. I had an Egg McMuffin. Only one. For strength. 

---

## LIZZIE:
Well, I also got ingredients for a really yummy salad and some *beautiful *salmon…

---

## WEEZIE:
Let’s order Thai food.

---

## LIZZIE:
Oh… Sure!

---

## TUCKER:
She already bought groceries, Lou.

---

## LIZZIE:
No, no, no, let’s do Thai! Or both? We could do both!

## WEEZIE:
I mean I’m not very hungry, but if Annie wanted Thai, if that sounded good&nbsp;—

---

## ANNIE:
Oh, I don’t care.

---

## WEEZIE:
But you should try to care. *God*, I always think about that Thanksgiving when you brought the little bags of food with you? The Ziploc bags?

---

## TUCKER:
Oh, we don’t need to get into that.

## LIZZIE:
Love Ziploc.

---

## WEEZIE:
You made stuffing without bread, just sautéed some&nbsp;— I think it was mostly celery.

---

## LIZZIE:
Everyone’s okay with Camembert, right?

---

## TUCKER:
ARE we?!

---

## WEEZIE:
But it sorta looked like normal stuffing, the way you mushed it up. It was very tricky… 

---

## ANNIE:
Right. Well, that was a long time ago.

---

## WEEZIE:	    
…Was it?

## TUCKER:
Lizzie, I didn’t even ask about your flight.



---

## LIZZIE: 										
It was great! I sat next to a burn victim!				

---

## TUCKER:								
That’s fun!							 	

---

## WEEZIE:						
Well, you clearly had a problem…					

---

## LIZZIE:
Mmmmm yummy yummy Camembert…	

---

## WEEZIE:
You were trying to get our attention…

## TUCKER:
…Lou?

---

## LIZZIE:								
A woman invented Camembert. Go women!				

---



## TUCKER:
Hey Lou? 

---

## WEEZIE:
I just think&nbsp;— especially while you’re grieving&nbsp;— it’s good to be mindful  of patterns&nbsp;—

---

## TUCKER:
Actually, Lou, I think I will have some wine. Could you pour me a glass?

---

## WEEZIE:
But of course! Is white okay?

---

## TUCKER:
It. Is. 
	
	

Wonderful. Thank you.
	

---

## LIZZIE:
Here you go. Nobody has to… It’s only if you…

---

## ANNIE:
It’s beautiful.

## WEEZIE:
Fucking fancy!

---

## TUCKER:
Lizzie, I love your sweater.

---

## LIZZIE:
Thank you! My mother-in-law died in it.


---

[Weezie's phone rings]

---

## TUCKER:
…Was that Barbie?

---

## WEEZIE:
…No, it was, um… 
	
… One of those no caller ID numbers.

---


## LIZZIE:
Oh, they are terrorists!

## TUCKER: 
Huh. Yeah, I texted Barb about her ETA. No response…

---

## TUCKER: 
Huh. Yeah, I texted Barb about her ETA. No response…

---

## WEEZIE:
Well, I wouldn’t be Barbie’s point of contact. Cause, you know. I’m an “SP.”

---

## ANNIE:								
A what?
## LIZZIE?
…Huh?

---

## WEEZIE:
SP. A Suppressive Person.

---

## ANNIE:
Oh, right.
## LIZZIE:
What is - Sorry what's an SP?

---

## WEEZIE:
It’s Martian lingo. I sent you a whole book about it, Liz.

---

## LIZZIE:
Right! Right. God. So then we’re all SP’s! SP club!

---

## WEEZIE:
I don’t think you’re an SP, Lizzie. You and Barb talk all the time.

---

## LIZZIE: 
No, I don’t! Only about&nbsp;— Tucker talks to her too!

---

## TUCKER:
Um, *rarely*. I did call her when we were thinking about adopting that Vizsla and she&nbsp;— 

---

## WEEZIE:
YOU TALK TO ME ABOUT DOGS! 

---

## TUCKER:
Um. You’ve never owned a Vizsla, Lou.

---

## WEEZIE:
We move in the same circles!

---

## ANNIE:
You and the Vizslas?

---

## WEEZIE:
YES!

## TUCKER:
Okay. Fine.

---

## LIZZIE:
Would you…? Are they good dogs?


---

## WEEZIE:
They’re very spirited but highly distractible!

---

## TUCKER:
Oh my god, we didn’t even end up getting the dog!

---

## WEEZIE:
And they’re prone to bleeding disorders, you IDIOT! JESUS TUCKER! GOD! GOD! Oh god I’m really upset! GOD! You talk to me about dogs!

---

## TUCKER:
This is beside the point. Not the point. As I was&nbsp;— you’re INSANE&nbsp;— As I was SAYING, I don’t speak to Barbie very often.  


---

## LIZZIE:
I still can’t believe she didn’t come to Mom’s funeral.

---

## WEEZIE:
I KNOW!!!

## ANNIE:
Why…

---

## TUCKER:
She had a ceremony thing…

## ANNIE:
Why did she&nbsp;—

---

## WEEZIE:
So what?! SO WHAT. Your mother is dead. Prioritize! Be a fucking human being!

---

## LIZZIE:
Be a human. That’s right.

## ANNIE:
Why did…

---

## TUCKER:
I’m not defending her! I think it’s really shitty, it’s&nbsp;—

---

## ANNIE:
Why did she join?
	
Like…join the -? I mean, was she a lonely person, or…?

	 

---

## WEEZIE:
Weak. She was weak. 	
	
And she allowed herself to be kidnapped. 
						


---

## ANNIE:
…What?

---

## WEEZIE:
She was kidnapped.

---

## ANNIE:								
Really?!								

---

## TUCKER:
Yes. By Alan.

## LIZZIE:
It’s true.

---

## ANNIE:
Like the Alan she’s currently married to? Uncle Alan?

---

## WEEZIE:
That’s the one!

## LIZZIE:
Mm-hm. Yes. 

---

## TUCKER:
He recruited her when she was fifteen. Indoctrinated her.

---

## WEEZIE:
Groomed her.

## LIZZIE:
Fifteen years old…

---

## Tucker:
He was in town doing a seminar, offered her some free test? We don't know all the details, but when he flew back to LA, Barbie went with him.


---

## LIZZIE:
Straight to Hollyweird! Left in the middle of the night. Terrible.

---

## WEEZIE:
Okay, but you weren’t really old enough to remember. 

---

## LIZZIE:
Yes, I was! I remember all of it!

---

## WEEZIE:
Anyway, she ran away and our dad, your Papa Duke, he was so fucking furious that he almost let her stay. 

---

## LIZZIE:
I remember all of this…

## TUCKER:
“I hereby disown her ass!”

---

## WEEZIE:
But your mom was really worried about Barb, I mean, our sister had been taken! So she begged your grandpa to let her go to the&nbsp;— to the *commune* that Barbie was&nbsp;— 

---

## TUCKER:
It wasn’t a commune.

---

## WEEZIE:
Your mom tricked Barbie into telling her where the Martian *commune* was, and she flew to LA, on her own dime, found Barbie, and she brought her home. 

---

## ANNIE: 
Wow, I didn’t&nbsp;— No one ever told me this. 

---

## TUCKER:
Dad wouldn’t speak to Barb. For weeks he wouldn’t even&nbsp;—



---

## WEEZIE:
Oh, and *then*&nbsp;— Oh my god.

---

## ANNIE:
What?

LIZZIE
Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

---

## WEEZIE:
So Barbie sets up a secret PO Box, starts communicating with Alan.

---

## TUCKER:
Which could not have been easy. Dad had her under lock and key…

---

## LIZZIE:
Locked in a tower! Rapunzel, Rapun&nbsp;— Yep.

---

## WEEZIE:
So she and Alan hatch a little plan, and the second she turns 18 she’s on a plane back to Los Angeles. Sneaky, sneaky, sneaky.

---

## ANNIE:								
Jesus.									

---

## TUCKER: 
She just disappeared. And we had no idea what happened until we found the letters. 

---

## WEEZIE:  
We found Alan’s letters under a floorboard.

## LIZZIE:  
I found the letters. Under the floorboard.

---

## ANNIE:
Wait. Okay, did she also hide food under there? Was that a thing?


	
## WEEZIE:

Eh…


---

## ANNIE:
I think Mom told me she hid all this fatty food, like, butter and fudge and tins of ham?

	

Was that…not her?
	
	

---

## TUCKER:
You know what? Would you mind if I lie down?

---

## ANNIE:
Are you okay?

## WEEZIE:
…For a nap?

---

## TUCKER:
I just, I didn’t sleep last night and I’m… I have a *little *headache.

---

## LIZZIE:
Oh no! Do you want some&nbsp;— I’ve got some Tramadol…

---

## WEEZIE:							
Where. Where do you have that?									

---

## LIZZIE:
Um…

## TUCKER:	
Maybe some water.		
	
    
    


---

## WEEZIE:
Is it in your coat or… ?

## ANNIE:
I’ll get it.

---

## LIZZIE:
It’s in my purse. Do you need some?

## TUCKER:
Thanks. Thank you.

---

## WEEZIE:							
I *do* need some. Yeah. Feeling sore from the&nbsp;— yeah.		   	  

	

---

## ANNIE:
I’m sorry you feel bad

---

## TUCKER:
Oh, I’m fine.
Just need to close my eyes.

## WEEZIE:
I’ll be fine.
……
You want me to sit with you?

---

## TUCKER:
No. No no no. No. That’s so sweet but…no. No, you stay and write and I’ll just mosey back when I feel a little…less…this… 

	

---

[Weezie's phone rings]
---

## WEEZIE:
Hey, I’m gonna step out for a minute.

---

## LIZZIE:
Everything okay?

---

## WEEZIE:
Yeah just doggie stuff. Some guy asking about the pups. 

---

## LIZZIE:
Hurry back!

## ANNIE:
Take your time!

---

## WEEZIE:
Shouldn’t take long.
	

---

## LIZZIE:
How’s the&nbsp;— Sorry, what?
You go.

## ANNIE:
How’s Magnus? Oh, sorry.
……
Sorry. I just said…How’s Magnus?

---

## LIZZIE:
Oh, he’s good! He’s so good. Yeah, he moved home. Which Bill and I love. 

---

Spends a lot of time in the basement, messin’ with wires and&nbsp;— But yeah he’s good! He’s…good.

---

## ANNIE: 
Good.

---

## LIZZIE:
…So…how’s your little speech coming? 

---

## ANNIE:			 				
It’s good!

---

## LIZZIE:
Good. 

---

## ANNIE:
Did you…write anything?

---

## LIZZIE: 
Hm? Oh…no. Not really.
Sorry.

---

## ANNIE:
Don’t be sorry.

---

## LIZZIE: 
I scribbled down some words? 

---

## ANNIE:
Can I read it?

---

## LIZZIE: 										
Um, no! No, I’m sorry&nbsp;—

---

## ANNIE:
That’s okay! That’s fine. Sorry. Yeah, that’s totally fine. 

---

## LIZZIE:
It’s just not&nbsp;— coherent? It’s been a lot to&nbsp;— It’s just been a lot.
	

---

Wanna hear a funny thing?
When I was really little, your mom told me that she was my real mother and that your Nana was just a ghost. Some old dead nun that only we could see. 

---

## ANNIE:
Huh. That’s weird.

---

## LIZZIE: 
Well, I believed it at first. Your Nana could be a little…absent. She had… disappointments. But even after I knew that your mom wasn’t my real mom, it was almost too late. It sort of…stuck.

---

## ANNIE:
Hm.

---

## LIZZIE:
And I was the baby of the family, just a…tiny doll that she…loved to play with and… She took care of me, you know? 

---

I was hers so I have lots of memories, probably as many as you, and now they’re all…invading my brain…
	


---

But of course memories aren’t real, they’ve done studies that prove…they’re only kind of real. Not really real. 

---

You know? want to be a resource for you, it’s just hard to…I mean where do you start?
	

---

## ANNIE:
I just wanna hear everything.

---

## LIZZIE:
Sure. 
Well, she raised me, so I have lots of memories. 
mostly boring… 

---

She bought me tampons, drove me to my first dance… 
Kept me safe. Safe from the boys…


---

## ANNIE:
Can you…tell me more about that?

---

## LIZZIE:
Sure.
Okay.


---

Well there was this one summer, I must’ve been about ten. I had a huge crush on this boy. His family used to live in that Tudor house across the street?


---

He had these big brown eyes and…I thought he was so beautiful. I loved him.
	


---

He was really strange.

---

## ANNIE:
Like… how?

---

## LIZZIE:
Oh I don’t know, he barely spoke, probably had a disorder, I don’t know… 


---

But I loved him. We had our own language. 
And we never&nbsp;— I mean it wasn’t&nbsp;— It was very pure. 
	


---

But your mom never liked him, didn’t trust him because…well he was a weirdo!
And he really was. Like, he wore a cape? And armor…

---

## ANNIE:
Mmm. Sexy…

---

## LIZZIE:
He liked the weight of it. 


---

But he’d come to the door, and your mom would put me in a sort of a bear hug and tell me not to go, that it wasn’t safe… 


---

She’d say, “I can see the future, Lizzie. He’ll desecrate you.”

---

## ANNIE:
…Huh. 

---

## LIZZIE:
Yeah. 
Yeah, but then I’d escape! I’d grab his hand and we’d run. 


---

We’d disappear into the woods and then it was our time. It was only ours.	
	


---

But this one day, he rang the bell, and your mom beat me to it…
She opened the door and…well she screamed. This terrible scream. 


---

She said: “It’s the creature! RUN! Protect yourself, Lizzie!!” 
And he became so upset. The screaming&nbsp;— it scared him, but she wouldn’t stop…


---

And I was sitting on the landing. I could see a sliver of his face…
He was kind of moaning? “I’m not bad. I’m good…I’m good.” 



---

And my sisters were watching from the window…
And they were laughing.


---

And then I went back upstairs. 
I didn’t go to the door. 

---

## ANNIE:
Jesus.

---

## LIZZIE:
Yes.
	
Your mom was very protective of me…of the love she gave me and…


---

I guess I was giving it away. And it wasn’t really mine to begin with. 
It was hers. 
	


---

I’ve eaten way too much cheese.


---

## ANNIE: 
But you said&nbsp;— I mean you said she kept you safe? 

	

---

## LIZZIE: 
Hm? 
Oh, right. The boy. Right…
Right, well, a few days later, he…this is so sad, he, um… 


---

He walked into the woods…and he hid behind a tree…
And he waited for someone to pass by on the…the path and…eventually someone did.


---

A little girl on her bike.
And he…he grabbed her…dragged her behind a rock…


---

He cut her…with a knife…
He stabbed her everywhere. 

---

## ANNIE:
Oh my god he killed her?

---

## LIZZIE: 
Hm?
Oh, I can’t remember if she died…
But he…obviously, he had to go away. 



---

So your mom probably saved me! Maybe she sensed that something wasn’t…


---

But he was always so gentle with me.
	
May I be excused?

---

## ANNIE:
Of course. 

---

## LIZZIE:
I should call Bill. I just…need to call Bill.

---

## ANNIE:
Hi.

---

## BARBARA:
And this is Palau.

---

## LIZZIE:
Oh my god so exotic!

## ANNIE:
Wow. That’s&nbsp;— wow.

## TUCKER:
Barbie, that’s stunning!

---

## WEEZIE:
Nice. Very flat and blue…

---

## BARBARA:
The marine life is breathtaking. These gorgeous corals, sea snakes, turtles…giant clams&nbsp;—

---

## WEEZIE:
Oh, clams huh?

## LIZZIE:
Clams have kidneys and hearts.

---

## BARBARA:
Uh-huh…
	 

---

Here’s the family&nbsp;— Oh, this was cool. This is Peleliu Island. Apparently, there was a big battle here? I didn’t know any of this, but Arlo’s a huge fan of World War II, so he insisted we&nbsp;—

---

## WEEZIE:
He’s a fan of war? Millions of people losing their lives? 
	
	

---

## BARBARA:					
No, you’re right. I suppose history “buff” would be more apt. 

---

## TUCKER:
You know what she meant.

---

## BARBARA:  		
Oh, and this is Malakal Island…

---

## TUCKER:
Barbie! Is that you?!						

---

## BARBARA:								
Uh-huh. Me and my  girls…

---

## LIZZIE:
Oh my god, look at your body!!

---

## BARBARA:
Oh I think Mia bought me that bikini. It’s cute, right?

---

## LIZZIE:
Wow! I can’t&nbsp;— Who do you think you are?! FRENCH? I’m kidding. You look&nbsp;— Wow!

---



## TUCKER:
Your breasts look very confident.

---

## BARBARA:
Well thank you. I like them too. 
	
	

---

## BARBARA:
Anyway. We just had a blast.



---

## LIZZIE:
My favorite pictures were the ones you took of fruit.


---

## BARBARA:
Uh-huh…

---

## BARBARA:
Well, I think we should do a big family vacation this year. All the sisters, all the kids, just pick a place  and go.

---

## WEEZIE:
So, was this a work trip?

---

## BARBARA: 
Hm? 

---

## WEEZIE:
Your island vacation? Didja work?

---

## BARBARA:
Um, no, not really. Alan led a few seminars…

---

## WEEZIE:
Seminars about what?

---

## TUCKER:
Barb, are you sure I can’t make you a sandwich? I picked up some really good turkey. 

---

## LIZZIE:
And I bought fish!

---

## BARBARA:
You’re so sweet, but I’m fine. I had a big salad at the airport. 
	

---

Oh, Annie, your mom did such a beautiful job with the kitchen. 

---

## ANNIE:
Yeah. She had a great eye for… Yeah.

---

## BARBARA:
This is a terribly sad occasion. But I am so grateful to be sitting here with you&nbsp;— with all of you. It feels…quite special. We are a wreath of light. 

---

And Annie, I’m honored to be included in this&nbsp;— this cool funeral think tank! I so wish I could’ve been a part of Mom’s.

---

## WEEZIE:								
You had a party to go to! 			
A special party.					   	  

---

Li’l clammy…


---

## ANNIE:								
I missed it too. I had a&nbsp;— a retreat thing. 

---

## BARBARA:
Yeah, I just couldn’t get out of it. I think Mom would’ve understood.
	


---

Or maybe not. I’ve no idea. She was a deeply unknowable woman.

	 

---

## ANNIE: 
Yeah… But for my mom’s funeral, I really wanna personalize it. 

---

## LIZZIE:
My foot itches…

---

## ANNIE:
Like, really curate an experience.

---

## LIZZIE:
Ah! It itches so much...

---

## ANNIE:
I just need your help to, uh, help me, help her be honored in a, an awesome–	

	      


---

## BARBARA:
What are you doing?

---

## ANNIE:
Hm?

---

## BARBARA:
With your… face.
	
It’s like you’re trying to loosen your face so you can peel it off.

---

## ANNIE:
Oh&nbsp;—.
Sorry. I didn’t know I was -   
Sorry.	

## TUCKER:
It’s barely noticeable…




---

## BARBARA:
Don’t apologize! I just wanted to make sure you weren’t in pain. 

---

## WEEZIE:
So Barbie, how’s the new job?

## ANNIE:
No pain, no.

---

## BARBARA:
Oh, I love it. 

---

## WEEZIE:
Uh-huh. So what do you *do*? On a day-to-day… day?

---

## BARBARA:
Well, it’s a mixed bag, really. There’s strategic planning, fundraising, executing vision… 


---

You know, we’re trying to integrate a more cross-functional approach while maintaining some divisional structure, but at the end of the day, I am still, essentially, the nexus  of&nbsp;—

---

## WEEZIE:
AHH! Jesus. Thanks Barb, that was chilling. I feel close to death. You sound…


---

(Robot voice)
Sub-prime. Mezzanine. Porcupine. Spork. Be Be Be BOP. Be Be Be BOP. 

---

## LIZZIE:
Haha. Porcupine?
	
	 

---

## WEEZIE:
(robot voice)
Boardroom. Software. Mussolini. Streamline.
Body thetans. Slave labor. Babylon. Groupthink.
Degradation. 

---

High crime. Invalidation. Isolation.
EVIL. Lies. EVIL. Lies.
CLAMS. CLAMS. EVIL LIES!

## TUCKER:
…Alright.

…HEY!

---

## BARBARA:						
Yep. That’s workplace bureaucracy in a nutshell. You nailed it, lady. 

---

## WEEZIE:
Your mom would’ve laughed at that, Annie. She...she got a kick outta me. 

---

## LIZZIE: 
We get a kick outta you, Lou! I laughed when you said porcupine. “Porcupine.”	

---

## LIZZIE:					
“Porcupine.”						
That’s funny… “Porcupine.”		
	(robot voice)			
Would you like a sandwich, Barb?	  	
							        


---

## BARBARA:				      
Um. No thank  you.	
					       
## LIZZIE:
(robot voice)
Sure! 

---

## BARBARA:
Tucker, that’s such a cute top.

---

## TUCKER:
No, it’s hideous. 

---

## WEEZIE:
Annie, I just thought of a story. The Seabiscuit of stories. 

---

## TUCKER:
Is it the story of Seabiscuit?

---

## WEEZIE:
Do you guys remember Sunday brunch? Dad and the goldfish?

---

## LIZZIE:
Oh my god. YES!         



## TUCKER:
Goldfish?

---

## WEEZIE:       								 
No, Liz. You were too young to remember.						

---

## LIZZIE:
No I wasn’t!

## TUCKER:
…Oh. Yes.

---

## ANNIE:
What’s the story?

---

## WEEZIE:
So when we were kids, we had, for some reason we had this endless supply of goldfish. 
										

---

## LIZZIE:
I wasn’t too young to remember this.

---

## WEEZIE:
And they were just constantly dying. 

---

## TUCKER:
Revolting.

## BARBARA:
Yes, their skin would turn white.

---

## WEEZIE:
Mm. I don’t remember that, but&nbsp;—

---

## BARBARA:
No, it would. It was like a fungal thing.

---

## WEEZIE:
Yeah, I don’t remember that, but&nbsp;—

## LIZZIE:
*Fungal*. Yep!

---

## TUCKER:
Barb’s right. They’d get these white spots and their eyes would bulge until they’d pop&nbsp;—

---

## BARBARA:
They’d pop out!

---

## ANNIE:
Their eyes?!

## LIZZIE:
This all sounds very familiar… 


---

## WEEZIE:						
Their eyes wouldn’t&nbsp;— what’re you talking about? 

---

## TUCKER:
There’s a name for it. Exploding Eye or…Popeye Goldfish Disease?

---

## WEEZIE:
In any event&nbsp;—

## BARBARA:
Yes! Popeye Goldfish Disease!



---

## WEEZIE:
It doesn’t&nbsp;— Annie, the point is: we had goldfish. They died a lot. 

---

## LIZZIE:
That’s right.

---

## WEEZIE:
So, growing up, we had these fancy Sunday brunches.

---

## BARBARA: 
Daddy would make us dress up. Even as teenagers we had to wear these dresses&nbsp;—

---

## TUCKER:
These awful white dresses. 

## LIZZIE:
He’d make us do a little dance.

---

## WEEZIE:						
Anyway…so *anyway*, this one Sunday&nbsp;— 

---

## BARBARA:
Oh right! With the board members. 

---

## TUCKER:
Dad’s business&nbsp;— the executive committee.

## LIZZIE:
Mm-hm. Yep. The *men*.

---

## WEEZIE:
Yeah, the council was there. But the day before, your mom had frozen one of the fish&nbsp;—

---

## TUCKER:
She froze the dead goldfish in an ice cube tray. 

---

## ANNIE:
Ew! Why?!

---

## WEEZIE:
I don’t know what compelled her. She was magnificent.

---

## BARBARA:
Yes, but anyway, she slipped the ice cube with the dead goldfish into Daddy’s water. 

---

## TUCKER:
But it was sick, the goldfish, its color had faded.

## LIZZIE:
Yes. Yes.


---

## BARBARA:
Right. So it looked fairly inconspicuous.

---

## LIZZIE:
Incognito…

---

## TUCKER:
So, over the course of lunch&nbsp;—

---

## LIZZIE:
Brunch.

---

## TUCKER:
Whatever. Over the course of *brunch*, the ice cube melted, so every time Dad took a sip the goldfish would kind of…brush his lips. 

---

## ANNIE:
EW!!

## LIZZIE:
Yes! Yes.

---

## BARBARA:			                 	
And he had no idea. 		          		

---

## TUCKER:
Well, he was *drunk*. Just soused.

## LIZZIE:
Not a clue. *IDIOT.*

---

## WEEZIE:
So, anyway, brunch is almost over, there’s just a drop left in Dad’s glass, and the four of us&nbsp;— 

---

## LIZZIE:
*Five* of us.

---

## WEEZIE:
– are watching the fish like…

---

## LIZZIE:
Yes, I remember I couldn’t finish my Baked Alaska cause I was SO nervous. 

---

## WEEZIE:
I’m sure you finished it. But anyway, we’re all biting our lips, trying not to laugh…

---

## BARBARA:
Oh, we were in big trouble. 

---

## TUCKER:
Mom kept pinching me under the table. 

	

---

## WEEZIE:
(Julia Child-esque voice)
“Sinful girls! Turn to the Blessed Mother.”

---

## TUCKER:
“Pray to the Blessed Virgin!”

## BARBARA:
“Dirty girls with dirty hearts!”

---

## LIZZIE:
“Naughty, naughty girls!”

---

## WEEZIE:							 
And Dad was *pissed*. Just quietly&nbsp;— 			

---

## LIZZIE:
“You should be drowned in the depths of the sea!” 

---

## WEEZIE:
Okay, we’re not doing the voice anymore.

---

## BARBARA:
Daddy was furious, but he couldn’t lose his temper in front of the board members…

---

## TUCKER:
Committee members.

## LIZZIE:
The men never spoke.


---

## WEEZIE:
So. He takes his last sip of water. And the fish corpse slips into his mouth… 

---

## TUCKER:
And it hits the back of his throat and he kind of&nbsp;—

## LIZZIE:
It smelled.

---

## WEEZIE:
He fucking chokes.
	
	

---

## ANNIE:
Oh god…

---

## BARBARA: 
But he was a very proper, very proud man, so he’s trying to be subtle.

---

## TUCKER:	
He’s trying to be discreet.		
	 
## LIZZIE:
Furtively…Yes. Discreet.

---

## WEEZIE:
So, he finally&nbsp;— He coughs up the goldfish, spits it onto his plate. It’s fucking foul.
And there’s this terrible silence. And the men in suits are…

---

## TUCKER:		
Oh, they were horrified.

## LIZZIE:
Mom started sobbing.

---

## WEEZIE:
Lizzie. No, she didn’t.

---

## BARBARA:
That was a different Sunday. After Daddy told her to stop spitting food into her napkin, “Like a tiny brainless thing.”

---

## LIZZIE:
“You stunted dodo bird!”&nbsp;—

## ANNIE:
…What?

---

## WEEZIE:		
Lizzie! Shut it. So. We’re staring at the dead fish, trying not to laugh. We laugh, we die. 

---

## TUCKER:
Oh my god it hurt. Trying to keep it in…

## LIZZIE:
We die! *Definitely* die. Die, die, die, die!

---

## BARBARA:							  	
I had to stab myself with an oyster fork.		 

---

## WEEZIE:
And I knew if I looked at your mom, I’d be done, I’d be so fucked, so I kept my head down, bit my cheek…

---

## BARBARA: 
And then Daddy said… He kind of whispered to no one in particular&nbsp;—

---

## LIZZIE:
Right. He whispered…

---

## WEEZIE:
“A banquet of consequences you shall face.”


---

## ANNIE:
Did you…&nbsp;— Could everyone hear it?

---

## BARBARA:
Oh, everyone heard it. It was so strange.



---

## TUCKER:
Very Old Testament.

---

## LIZZIE:
Yeah, very, like, Hamlet? And very Old Testament too. 
 

---

## WEEZIE:
He was just staring at the fish with this look of…

---

## TUCKER:
Like he was re-examining his entire life. 

---

## BARBARA:							
“A banquet of consequences you shall face.”

---

## WEEZIE:
And I looked at your mom. And that was it. We were done. All four of us just&nbsp;—

---

## LIZZIE:
All *five* of us! 

---

## BARBARA:
Daddy made us leave the table, he&nbsp;—

## TUCKER:
He turned bright red and he&nbsp;—

---

## LIZZIE:

“Laugh again, girls, and I’ll cut out your tongues and shove them down your throats, you five-headed whore!” 

---

[Lizzie giggles]
---


## TUCKER:
Sorry, this isn’t… It’s not a great story.

---

## ANNIE:
No, I love it! I love it. I’m adding it to…
	
Goldfish story…

---

## BARBARA:
“A banquet of consequences you shall face.”

---

## WEEZIE:
Well, anyway. We had a good laugh. Your mom pled guilty and had to&nbsp;—

---

## LIZZIE:
No she didn’t. 

	

---

## TUCKER:
Yes, she did. Cause Mom used Dad’s belt to&nbsp;— Annie, your grandmother beat the shit out of your mom’s legs.

---

## LIZZIE: 
No. That was a different time.

---

## WEEZIE:
You were too little to remember.

---

## LIZZIE: 
No I wasn’t! I remember. We were *all *punished.

---

## BARBARA:
Lizzie’s right. Daddy spanked each of us when nobody copped to it. He made us stand in a line next to the blue statue and&nbsp;—

---

## WEEZIE:
Okay but why do you keep saying Daddy?  Like, since when do you call Dad, Daddy?

---

## TUCKER:
Blue statue spanking was for something else. 

---

## LIZZIE:
It was a blue sphinx. And, no. It was for the goldfish. 

	

---

## BARBARA:
Oh honey, I don’t want this.

## WEEZIE:
No…


---

## LIZZIE: 				
I thought you said…I thought…

	

---

## WEEZIE:
No, you’re wrong. Annie, your mom made a full confession. 

---

## TUCKER:
Lou’s right, I remember Mom blabbering
about the goldfish as she was belting her legs.

## LIZZIE:
“Can I make you a sandwich?”
“Sure!” I could’ve sworn…


---

## BARBARA:								
No, that was Daddy. And he didn’t use a belt. 		

	

---

## WEEZIE:	
But Barb, 
seriously, why do you
keep saying “Daddy”?


---

## BARBARA:								
I don’t know, Lou. Does it bother you?  			     

---

## WEEZIE:
No, it doesn’t bother me. I’m not bothered. But
I mean, “Daddy”? Are you Shirley fucking Temple?

## LIZZIE:
Anyone want this?
…Lou? ……Tuck?

---

## BARBARA:
No, I’m not Shirley Temple...

## TUCKER:
No thanks.

---

## WEEZIE:									
“Daddy.”					 		 

---

## LIZZIE:
Turkey sandwich! Going once, going twice, going&nbsp;—

---

## WEEZIE:
Omigod just give it to Annie.				   



---

## ANNIE: 
…Um. No thanks.

---

## WEEZIE:
Eat the sandwich.

	

---

## BARBARA:
I don’t think she wants the sandwich, Lou.

---

## WEEZIE:
No, excuse me, this isn’t… It’s not like that. 

---

## BARBARA:
But she’s an adult. 

---

## ANNIE:
I could…have a few bites?

	 

---

## WEEZIE:
Okay Barbie. You know best. 

## LIZZIE:
I’ll just put it in the fridge.

---

## BARBARA:
I’m not saying I know best, I’m saying Annie knows best, when it comes to&nbsp;—

---

[Phone rings]
---


## WEEZIE:
I’ll call him back.



---

Hey Annie? Annie Bananie? Do you have&nbsp;—… I’m not seeing any more…
Should I check downstairs?

---

## ANNIE:
For wine?

---

## TUCKER:
Oh, but…no… 

	 

---

## ANNIE: 
We only have soda downstairs. 

---

## TUCKER:
Soda might be nice…
	
	

---

## WEEZIE:
If I made a quick trip to Kroger, would anyone…? 
	

---

## LIZZIE: 
I’d drink more. I absolutely would. That bag is bleeding. 

---

## WEEZIE:							
Great! Then I’ll go, I’ll just scurry there and back.	

---

## TUCKER:
Lou, no.           

---

## BARBARA:
Want me to drive you?

## LIZZIE:
There’s blood in that bag. 

---

## WEEZIE:
What? No. 
	
Any requests? Annie, do you need a…a special treat?

---

## ANNIE:		
What?	          

## LIZZIE:
Why blood?

---

## WEEZIE:
Special ice cream treat?

## TUCKER:
…She can’t drive.

---

## ANNIE:								
No, I’m okay.							

---

## WEEZIE:
Alright. I’ll be back in a…Okay. Keys, wallet, bones&nbsp;— or&nbsp;— not bones… 

	

---

## TUCKER:
Lou, I’m gonna come with you.

## LIZZIE:
Bones?!

---

## WEEZIE:
No, no, no. You stay.

## LIZZIE:
Whose bones?


---

## TUCKER: 
Well, I just remembered, I have to pick up my Zoloft at the pharmacy.

---

## WEEZIE:
Ooh, Zoloft. Don’t tell Barbie, drugs are a big&nbsp;— It’s a no-no, right? 

---

## TUCKER:
Lemme just grab my purse…

## LIZZIE:
It’s a no-no?

---

## WEEZIE:
What’s the punishment for taking pills, Barb? Make you dig a hole? Waterboard ya?
Let John Travolta suck on your toes?

---

## LIZZIE:
(Laughing too hard)
I wouldn’t consider that a punishment…

---

## BARBARA:
Not our official policy.

---

## WEEZIE:
Is it hard to be in a room with this many SP’s? 
…Suppressive Persons?

---

## BARBARA:
Have you be reading some literature, Lou?

---

## WEEZIE:

Have you been in a cult for 35 years, Barb?

	

---

## TUCKER:
Okay! So we’re gonna go, we’re just gonna leave right now and we’ll see you in a bit! Give me your keys, Lou.

---

## WEEZIE:
You’re a stunted little snake.		     

	

---

## WEEZIE:	
Ta-ta, ladies! Lizzie, don’t suppress your sister while I’m gone!
No suppressing!

## TUCKER:
Give me your keys.


---

## LIZZIE:
Haha. Okay! Hurry back!
	
## TUCKER:
Keys. Now.

---

## LIZZIE:
Such a ham.

---

## ANNIE:
So, um, regarding the funeral. I was thinking we could show a video of Mom dancing?

---

## LIZZIE:
Sure!

---

## ANNIE:
Maybe the one where she’s dancing with a bucket?

---

## LIZZIE:
Uh-huh…

---

## ANNIE:
It’s very rhythmic, a lot of contraction and release… I can&nbsp;— I’ll just -.

---

## LIZZIE:
Oh. Okay…


 

---

## BARBARA:
…Huh.

## LIZZIE:
That’s stirring… 

---

## ANNIE: 
Yeah. It’s beautiful.

---

## BARBARA:
Right.

## LIZZIE:
I’ll bet!

---

## ANNIE:
I mean, when she did it.

---

## LIZZIE:
I liked it just now! 

---

## ANNIE:
Cool. 
	
Do you guys have any thoughts on the order of service? 

---

## LIZZIE:
Hmm. I don’t…
	
## BARBARA:
Not at the moment.

---

## LIZZIE:
You know, sometimes I need a task to…help me think? Maybe…
Like your mom’s room? Little clean up?  Would it be helpful if I…?

---

## ANNIE:
Oh, um, sure!

---

## LIZZIE: 
Just a little clean up? I love tasks, I…I need them.

---

## ANNIE:
Sure! That’s… Thanks so much!

---

## LIZZIE:
No, I don’t mind, I&nbsp;— Thank you for…
	
And I think the dance thing is a really good idea. That’s…Wow! That’s… It’ll be great. 

---

## BARBARA: 
You look so much like her. It’s a little…uncanny. 

---

## ANNIE:
Ha. I Wish   

---

## BARBARA:
You do. Same body, same shape...
You could be twins.

 

---

## ANNIE:
No. 


---

When I was little, I was…just like obsessed with her body. Like a, almost like a predator. 
I mean, not really…


---

I just liked it. I liked watching her body move and talk and… 
She had her own language.


---

Actually, I was&nbsp;— honestly I was jealous because I didn't - 

---

Do you want some turkey?


---

## BARBARA:
No thank you. What were you saying? 

---

## ANNIE:
Nowhere. I mean, nothing. I don’t remember.

---

## BARBARA:
I liked your dance.

---

No I did. You move like a dancer

---

## Annie:
When I was a kid, I used to dance in my room? For, like, hours...

---

I'd just go in my room and close my eyes and spin around until my body didn't feel like a body anymore, just a shape?

---

And eventually, if I stayed in motion, these pictures would leak into my brain and they'd make a story and I'd watch the story, from the inside, like a movie, you know?

---

And sometimes I'd get stuck in the movie. but it felt real.  I'd get stuck in the movie. but it felt real. Like a different version of real.

---

## BARBARA:
That's interesting.

---

## ANNIE:
Yeah. 
And there's turkey

---

## BARBARA:
What was the movie about?

---

## ANNIE: 
Oh, I can't remember.
	
I love that picture.

---

## BARBARA:
I’m just curious because it’s interesting. I’m curious if you tried to remember…
If you were more intentional… 
	

---

## ANNIE: 
Sometimes there’d be these men? In the movie? Their eyes never blinked. And I'd hide from them but they always... I can't remember.

---

## BARBARA:
Oh, but you should investigate. It’s like spring cleaning for your brain. 



---

## ANNIE: 
That’s okay.

---

## BARBARA: 
But it’s so interesting you should try. To recall. You could close your eyes.
Close your eyes and just…return to the incident. What do you see?  

---

## ANNIE:
My eyelids.

---

## BARBARA:
No…You see *them*.
Because they’ve found you.


---

## ANNIE:
They want a show.

---

## BARBARA: 
Good. They request a show.

---

## ANNIE:
But it makes them cry. 

---

## BARBARA:
Why?

---

## ANNIE:
Because it's pure. What I have. It's pure and it touches them

---

## BARBARA:
Continue to recall. 

---

## ANNIE:
Too fuzzy.

---

## BARBARA:
Continue to recall the incident.

	
	

---

## ANNIE: 
(singsong)
Hands move like fast water…then slow water…
Worlds crisscross...


---

(sharp inhalation)
A balloon.

---

## BARBARA:
Recall the tangible body.

---

## ANNIE:
But I’m a balloon.

---

## BARBARA:
Recall the tangible body.

---

## ANNIE:
*Shhhh.*
Puts a bird in my stomach. 
They eat the light. 

---

## BARBARA:
Recall&nbsp;—

---

## ANNIE:
They eat the light. 

---

## BARBARA:
No. The tangible. dissolve to exterior

---

## ANNIE: 
Outside.



---

## BARBARA:
Yes.

---

## ANNIE:
Outside.

---

## BARBARA: 
Yes.

---

## ANNIE:
Outside, I…opened eyes and saw.

---

## BARBARA:
*See.*

---

## ANNIE:
Mom. 
Opens the door.
Looks *disgusted*.

---

## BARBARA:
Why?

---

## ANNIE:
Because she can see everything. 
What I’m doing, what I’m picturing, all the worlds, she…
	

---

She sees everything. 
	 

---

“That’s not nice, Annie. What you’re doing, that’s just…not nice.”


---

## BARBARA:
End of session.

---

She wasn't careful with you. 
	
	

---

## ANNIE:
What?

	

---

## BARBARA:
I can see she wasn’t careful with you. 

	

---

## ANNIE: 
Oh.

That’s not true. 

---

## BARBARA:
Okay.

---

## ANNIE:
It’s not.

---

## BARBARA:
Okay. 

---

## ANNIE:
She’s a good mom.

---

## BARBARA:
Okay.

---

## ANNIE:
She's lovely.

---

## BARBARA:
She was, yes. Very lovely. And to receive her love…*Oh*. It was like a warm meal.


---

This house was not…safe. Your mom protected us in a way but I needed…more help. Alan helped me, the church helped me, and that was hard for your mom. It infuriated her. 

---

## ANNIE:
Why?

---

## BARBARA:
Because I didn’t need her. 

---

Her vision was a virus. She could look at you and change the way you saw the world. She could overpower your very self-conception. 
She was a dangerous woman.  

	 

---

## ANNIE:
What was that “recall”?


---

## BARBARA:
I was just... asking about your experience.

---

## ANNIE:
You made me keep going. I wanted to stop.

---

## BARBARA:
I was trying to help you reexamine a…a discordant moment…

---

## ANNIE:
Discordant?

---

## BARBARA:
You have to make contact before you can release.

---

## ANNIE:
Excuse me, what?

---

## BARBARA:
Because I was also trapped in an endless loop of stimulations.

---

## ANNIE:
Please stop.

---

## BARBARA:
I recognize certain behaviors in you. Certain aberrations.

---

## LIZZIE: 
(offstage)
HEY ANNIE?

---

## BARBARA:
Certain behavioral indicators that I recognize as anti-survival&nbsp;— 

---

## LIZZIE:
(offstage)
Hey Annie? 

---

## LIZZIE:
Hey!

---

## ANNIE:
Hey.

---

## LIZZIE: 
Hey! *Hey*, I was gonna have you come up, but you didn’t, and that’s fine, but hey! 

---

So these can be thrown away. It’s mostly Beta-blockers and  immunosuppress&nbsp;— Hm?

---

## ANNIE:
Is that my mom’s scarf?

---

## LIZZIE:
… It is! Yes! Good eye. Yes. Yes, I wanted you to, um…have it, so…

…And now…you…do. Yay!
	


---

Oh! Also, I&nbsp;— I wasn’t snooping, but…I found these earrings? And I know you don’t have your ears pierced…

---

## ANNIE:
Uh-huh.

---

## LIZZIE: 
And I think they were a gift from my dad? A birthday present maybe? I recognize the gold detailing and… I think they were custom-made. 

---

## ANNIE:
Uh-uh. 

---

## LIZZIE: 
And they’re actually&nbsp;— well, they’re stunning and I thought&nbsp;— And you can totally say no, but I thought…because your ears aren’t pierced&nbsp;—

---

## ANNIE:
You can have them.

---

## LIZZIE: 
…Wait, really?

---

## ANNIE:
Sure.
	
	

---

## LIZZIE:
Oh my god, really?!

---

## ANNIE:
…Yeah?

---

## LIZZIE:
WOW. *Thank you*. And you can totally change your mind…

---

## ANNIE:
I won’t.

---

## LIZZIE:
I just… They were gifts from my dad so they&nbsp;— they mean something to me, and&nbsp;—

---

## BARBARA: 
No.

---

## LIZZIE:
…No what?

---

## BARBARA:
They belonged to her mother. So they should stay here. 

---

## ANNIE:
That’s...not a thing. 

---

## LIZZIE:
I mean, I don’t need to take them, I just thought… 

---

## ANNIE:
Aunt Lizzie should have them.

---

## LIZZIE: 
I just thought, you know, they’re definitely something I’d wear…

---

## ANNIE:
Yeah, I can’t wear them.

---

## LIZZIE:
I just think they’re beautiful. And Dad left her the house and his mother’s rings&nbsp;— she got so many gifts and Tuck got the stamps and the pens 

---

and Barb you got the silverware AND the brooches and Louise got the golf clubs and the hunting decoys which are so hideous but they’re worth something 

---

and all I got were the cast iron door stops and I really don’t like them, I like *pretty* things and Daddy never gave me any jewelry.



---

## BARBARA:
Lizzie. You are a tiny brainless thing.


---

They were not a gift. They were reparations. So unless you intend to throw them into a fire, don’t fucking touch them.
	


---

I have to call Alan.

---

## WEEZIE:
(offstage)
Helter Skelter, bitches!!
	
	
Well, HEY kids!							 

---

## LIZZIE:
Hey!

## TUCKER:	
Inside voice, please.

---

## WEEZIE:
We come bearing gifts! Like the biblical horsemen. 

---

## LIZZIE:
Of…the apocalypse?



---

## WEEZIE:
Got a special treat for Annie Bananie. 
	
	


---

## WEEZIE:
Catch!

## ANNIE:
Ow.

---

## WEEZIE:
I’m sorry
I’m so sorry!


## ANNIE:
It’s fine.


---

## TUCKER:
You’re supposed to say “Catch” *before*  you throw a thing.

---

## WEEZIE:
I know! I apologized.

---

## LIZZIE:			
Oh, Tuck. Wittle Tuck. I thought you outgrew those migraines?

---

## TUCKER: 
I *DID*. God, it’s blinding… 

---

## WEEZIE:
So Barb, you still off the sauce?

---

## BARBARA:
I am.

---

## WEEZIE:
Sure I can’t offer you anything?

---

## BARBARA:
I’m fine.

---

## WEEZIE:
Seriously, lemme get ya&nbsp;— How bout some Kool-Aid?

---

## BARBARA:
You’re getting sloppy, Louise.

---

## WEEZIE:
Probably…
What an incisive observation.

---

## TUCKER:
Barbie, that scarf is so pretty.

---

## BARBARA:
Oh, I think Alan brought this back from India.

---

## LIZZIE:
Oooo!! You know, I’ve never wanted to go there.

---

## WEEZIE:
“Sloppy.”

## TUCKER:
When was he in India?

---

## LIZZIE:
But I LOVE samosas.

## WEEZIE:
I’m coping, you frigid witch.

## BARBARA:
Mmm…Last December maybe?

---

## LIZZIE:	
And those yummy yogurt drinks?


## TUCKER:
Well, lucky Alan.
They have a great Squash Academy in Chennai.

---

## WEEZIE:
Our sister is dead.

---

## BARBARA: 
Yes, it’s a beautiful country. Beautiful people. 

---

## WEEZIE:
Our sister died. She’s dead. I’m drinking because I’m *sad*. I’m *sad* because she’s dead. 

---

## BARBARA:
Everyone’s sad, Lou. 

---

## WEEZIE:
Right. Sure. But also, there’s a spectrum.

---

## TUCKER:
It’s not a competition, honey.

---

## WEEZIE:
Well I wish it were because I’d fucking crush it, and like, just so you know, I have nice scarves and sweaters, too. Okay? I wore this cause I was training the dogs.

---

## TUCKER:
We *know*.

## LIZZIE:
Very practical…

---

## BARBARA:
Lou, nobody cares what you look like. We just love you.

---

## WEEZIE:
Yeah. Well I’m sure you loved Mom too, but you didn’t show up to her funeral. 

---

## BARBARA:									
You’re right. I didn’t do that.

---

## WEEZIE:
And when you don’t show up for a person, you send a message…

	


---

But I show up because I love my family, we’re supposed to be a team and&nbsp;— Annie, your mom and I were a team, we really&nbsp;— Oh god I’m alone in my own fucking realm!

---

## BARBARA:
Honey, Tucker has a headache and you’re speaking very energetically&nbsp;—

---

## WEEZIE:
No. NO! You do not get to be protective of her. That is not an intimacy that you&nbsp;— 
You haven’t earned that. 
	



---

Okay! So, whaddya got?

---

## ANNIE:
Nothing.

---

## WEEZIE:
I’m sure it’s not nothing. Show me what you wrote. 

---

## ANNIE:
I didn’t write anything.

---

## WEEZIE:
Stop. Come on. Just read us what you have.

---

## ANNIE: 
I have nothing! I have&nbsp;—… I mean, look!
	
	

---

## TUCKER:
…That’s okay. We’ve still got plenty of time… 

---

## ANNIE: 
For what? Nobody has any thoughts. I mean, Aunt Lizzie, you wouldn’t even let me read what you wrote and I don’t know if my ideas are good or stupid, I just need some help, and nobody is helping me.

---

## TUCKER:
Okay.

---

## ANNIE:
Don’t you care how she’s remembered? 

---

## WEEZIE:
Of course I fucking care.

---

## TUCKER:
Of course we do, Annie.

## LIZZIE:
We care very much…

---

## ANNIE:
Then why aren’t you…? What have you done?

---

## TUCKER:
Well…I documented her accomplishments and…where she worked and…for how long...

---

## WEEZIE:
I wrote something.

---

## LIZZIE:
I’ll be honest, mine is just a stream of&nbsp;—. It’s a mess. I mean it’s really messy. 

---

## WEEZIE:
I have something.

---

## LIZZIE:
It’s just nonsense words and, honestly, some of them are…maybe a little upsetting?

---

## WEEZIE:
Hi. Hello. I wrote something.

	

---

## ANNIE:
Oh. 
It’s lovely. 

---

## WEEZIE:
It was easy. 

---

## ANNIE: 
Yeah. … Yeah, I don’t think I wanna speak anymore.

---

## TUCKER:
No, no, no. You should!

## LIZZIE:
Aww, no, you have to!

---

## ANNIE: 
No because honestly, *honestly*, I don’t think she’d want that.

---

## TUCKER:
Annie, that’s crazy. 

---

## ANNIE:
I don’t&nbsp;— I don’t think she’d want her little shadow monster to speak&nbsp;—

---

## TUCKER:
No, Annie. No.

## WEEZIE:
…What? Shadow what?



---

## ANNIE:
In her diary. I’m her shadow twin.

---

## LIZZIE:
My diaries are full of terrible things. Disturbing, really. 

---

## TUCKER:
Annie, she was sick. She was confused.

---

## ANNIE:
Like why would she say that?

---

## TUCKER:
Honey. She was on opioids.

---

## ANNIE:
‘Swarm of dark’? Like is that how she thinks of me? Like I’m her gross creepy Mr. Hyde?

---

## TUCKER:
No, you could never be that. You’re a wonderful person.

---

## LIZZIE:							
Yes, and you’re a teacher. And teachers are good. I could *never*. No thank you.

---

## WEEZIE:
Yeah. And like maybe she was mad at you when she wrote that. And that’s okay.

---

## ANNIE:
…What?

---

## WEEZIE:
Like, maybe she was mad, kids are maddening and…like you could be difficult.

---

## BARBARA:
Louise.

---

## WEEZIE:
What? What’d I say?

---

## ANNIE:
I was difficult?


---

## WEEZIE:
As a child? Sure, you were needy. You needed a lot.
You could be sneaky…dishonest…
Still working on that one.			

## TUCKER:
No. No you were not.

---

## BARBARA:
Stop.

## LIZZIE:
Does anyone want some tapenade?

## TUCKER:
Louise.

---

## ANNIE:
Wait, what?

---

## LIZZIE:
Is it salmon time?

---

## ANNIE:
You think I’m dishonest?

---

## WEEZIE:
Annie, come on. 

---

## ANNIE:
“Come on”? What? How am I dishonest?


---

## WEEZIE:
Will was in the car. That story about the tongues? You never mentioned him, but he was there.

---

## ANNIE:
…I don’t remember that.

---

## WEEZIE:
Yeah, your mom used to pay him to help her out, he told me what happened. Why didn’t you include him in the story?

---

## ANNIE:					
Um. Because he wasn’t there.

---

## WEEZIE:							
That’s a lie.		              			

---

## LIZZIE:
Now, I have a question about these tongues…



---

## ANNIE:
You think I’m lying about him being in the car?

## TUCKER:
Okay, Louise?

---

## LIZZIE:
Namely, whose tongue?

---

## WEEZIE:								
No, I mean, you’re lying about a much bigger thing.			

---

## ANNIE:
What’s the thing?

---

## WEEZIE:
You tell me.

---

## ANNIE:
…Well, I can’t. Because I don’t
know what you’re talking  about.

## TUCKER:
Okay this does not feel helpful, this does not feel productive&nbsp;—



---

## WEEZIE:
But you do! You do, you do, that’s not fair because yes you do, I did not speak to your mom for five years. 

---

My sister, best friend in the whole fucking world&nbsp;— she would not speak to me. That’s so much time. You had a hand in that. 

---

And I’m not mad, but there’s been no accountability. So I want you to tell me&nbsp;— in words, not drawings or puppets, in words, your words&nbsp;— what did my son do?

---

## BARBARA:
Louise. You’re upset and drunk. You’re very, very drunk. 

---

## WEEZIE:
JESUS CHRIST WHAT ARE YOU EVEN DOING HERE?!

---

## LIZZIE:
I think it’s…time to eat!


---

## WEEZIE:
Tell me what he did, Annie.

---


## WEEZIE:
Say it. Just say it.
Come on, baby.
Tell me, tell me, tell me.
Tell me RIGHT NOW.



## TUCKER:
Let’s calm down.

Let’s work on the eulogy. 

---

## ANNIE: 
I don’t know.

---

## WEEZIE:
You don’t know. Okay, well I don’t know what that means. You’re not a little girl anymore, so you can use your *adult woman *voice to tell us&nbsp;—

---

## TUCKER:
Okay, that’s enough, Louise. That’s *enough*, Louise.

## BARBARA:
Hey!


---

## WEEZIE:
To tell&nbsp;— Let me talk! 

---

To tell us what my son did because if ya can’t remember then maybe someone was leading the witness. 

---

And that’s nobody’s fault, children are highly suggestible, they want to please, they want attention, and GOD you were insatiable. 

---

You starved her, she could barely put you down and mom&nbsp;— your mom was not… Neutrality is important.


---

## BARBARA:
Stop…stop…Tucker…Tucker…
Tucker make her stop.

---

## WEEZIE:
Memories can be contaminated, and I’ve&nbsp;—
Tuck, I’ve read a lot about this&nbsp;— they can be changed.


---

And your mom had a bias and you had a need and it makes
so much sense! STOP. “Okay, okay.” STOP.	 

---

Stop.
This is important! Annie, he wrote your mom a letter,		
he explained everything, he broke it down,
she couldn’t deny it, it was undeniable&nbsp;—


---

Listen to me: she believed him. 
And she apologized.




---

## ANNIE:
I didn’t know they talked	
She never told me they talked…	

---

## ANNIE:
But I told her things. I can’t… I don’t feel good.	

---

## LIZZIE:
I should cook the fish…
								

---

## WEEZIE:			 				
You were a needy kid and ya wanted…	

---

## BARBARA:
You’re unbelievable…

---

## WEEZIE:
Your mom saw it! She saw everyone’s secret guts.

## BARBARA:
Oppressive…stunted…

---

## TUCKER:
You’re being&nbsp;— This is cruel.


## BARBARA:
Just like Mom. You see nothing.

---

## WEEZIE:
We forgive you, we all love you, but you have to be honest.

---

## BARBARA:
I will not accommodate your reality, Louise.

---

## WEEZIE:
E.T.&nbsp;— GO&nbsp;— HOME!! Fucking fly away! JUST LEAVE!!

---

## TUCKER:
HEY!

## LIZZIE:
I don’t know what to do with the fish!	

---

## WEEZIE:
You’re not part of this conversation, Barbie. You weren’t even here! You don’t know anything!

---

## BARBARA: 
I know that our sister was negligent. That’s actually the kindest&nbsp;— ‘complicit’ feels more  appropriate.

---

## WEEZIE:
Oh my god you’re so ungrateful it’s ASTOUNDING. 

---

## BARBARA:
What are you talking about?

---

## WEEZIE:
She saved you! You were fifteen and she saved you from an adult man!  A predator!

---

## BARBARA:
You don’t know what you’re talking			     
about so you should probably shut up.

## ANNIE:
Did people see him?

---

## WEEZIE:
She brought you home!

## LIZZIE:
What?!

---

## BARBARA:
Yes. Back to the lion to save herself. 

---

## WEEZIE:
Such a victim.

## TUCKER:
What are you talking about?

---

## BARBARA:
You were protected.

## ANNIE:
Did you see him?

---

## WEEZIE:
You don’t know shit about what I went through.

## LIZZIE:
What is… What?!

---

## BARBARA:
You’d just run for the woods.

---

## WEEZIE:
Oh, please. You weren’t a Yazidi sex slave.

## ANNIE:
Did everyone see him?

---

## BARBARA:
*Wow.*
(to Lizzie)
You know. Even if you didn’t know know, you knew. 		


## LIZZIE:
What does that mean?!
What  is she talking about?!

---

## ANNIE:
Did you see him?

## LIZZIE:
What?!
What?! See who?!



---

## TUCKER:
I don’t… I don’t even know.

---

## ANNIE:
Did you see him?


---

## TUCKER:
See who, honey? What are we&nbsp;— ?

---

## ANNIE:
When I wasn’t home, when I couldn’t come home, when the family was together and I wasn’t home, did people…? Was he here?

---

## WEEZIE:
Of course. Because my son is a loved member of this family.

---

## ANNIE:								
I maybe… need to sit. 

	

---

## LIZZIE:
Oh, careful! How about some crackers?		

## TUCKER:
You’re okay. It’s okay…

---

## WEEZIE:
Hey I, like, love you&nbsp;— I feel really sorry for you.

---

## ANNIE:
I can’t see anything.


---

## WEEZIE:
But you gotta tell us the truth
because we need to move on.


---

That’s what your mom would want.
Same team. Clean slate.
Come together…just finally		 		
be a nice fucking family.







---

## ANNIE:
Okay…okay…
I’m ready to be honest.

---

## WEEZIE:
There you go. Good girl. 

---

## ANNIE: 
(calmly)
To be honest, I can’t tell you what he did cause it would ruin your life.

---

## WEEZIE:
…Excuse me?

---

## ANNIE:
If you pictured it? If I put it into your head…
You’d be sick forever. 
	
	

---

## WEEZIE:
Well. That’s convenient.

---

## ANNIE:
Not for me.

---

## WEEZIE:
Okay, Annie. If you’re not ready to have this conversation…

---

## ANNIE: 
When I have sex with my boyfriend, after it’s over…
I go in the bathroom…I grab a towel…I push it into my mouth…
And I scream. 
	


---

I picture his death. My very sweet boyfriend who only wants good for me?


---

I imagine smashing his face with a wrench…or shooting him in the mouth…or sinking my teeth into his neck into all the parts of the body essential to life.
That is the only thing that makes me feel okay.


---

And that’s your son’s fault. A person you made with your body. So it’s your fault too. 
You’re a poisonous. Fucking. Tree. 

	

---

## TUCKER:
We are NOT!
Stop it you need to stop it RIGHT NOW.

## BARBARA:
No. NO!
Louise. Louise!


---

## WEEZIE:
You’re sick, Annie. You are not well&nbsp;— Fuck off, Barb!

---

## ANNIE: 
Hey tell your son he’s banished forever, okay?

---

## WEEZIE:
Stop talking. Be quiet!

## TUCKER:
Shit. Oh, shit. 

---

## ANNIE: 
Tell him I hate him, and I miss him, I miss his hands…  

---

## WEEZIE:									
Shut up.								

---

## ANNIE:
And his mouth… 

---

## WEEZIE:
How dare you.

---

## ANNIE: 
How dare I? He ruined me, you IDIOT. I’m ruined. I’m a fucking dud!

---

## TUCKER:
No, Annie.

## LIZZIE:
Don’t say that!  You’re not supposed to say that!

---

## ANNIE:
A loser inflatable lawn decoration fucking McDonald’s toy cheap plastic NOTHING that nobody even knows how to play with and oh my god YOU ATE DINNER WITH HIM?!


---

Like, he’d knock on the door and you’d come to the door and then you’d open the door and LET HIM INSIDE?!?! OH. And she fed him. Oh.

["Always Something There to Remind Me" blasts on radio]

---

[All sisters scream]

---

[Annie turns off music]

---

## WEEZIE:
I wanna go home.

---

## LIZZIE:
I’ll take you anywhere, Lou. Just let me… 


---

[Loud knock at door. Sisters scream. Another knock.]

---

## TUCKER:
I think that’s Sharon.

---

## WEEZIE:
Huh?

---

## TUCKER:
Sharon Frisbee. She’s dropping off some flowers…and a pie. 

---

## WEEZIE:
Ah.


---

## BARBARA:
I hated Sharon.

---

## WEEZIE:
Me too.

## TUCKER:
Definitely. 

---

## LIZZIE:
Yeah, I hated her too.

---

## WEEZIE:
…You didn’t know her.

---

## LIZZIE:
Yes, I did.

---

## WEEZIE:
She moved to Hartford when you were still in diapers, Liz. 

---

## BARBARA:
Right. That’s right.

## TUCKER:
Oh yeah.

---

## LIZZIE:
I remember her.

---

## WEEZIE:
You’re confusing her with Shauna…  What’s her name?

---

## LIZZIE:
No.

## TUCKER:
Fabacher.

---

## WEEZIE:
…Right

## BARBARA:
Fabacher. Right.

---

## LIZZIE:
No. I remember.

---

## WEEZIE:
You’re remembering Shauna.

---

## LIZZIE:
No.

## BARBARA:
I didn’t care for Shauna either.

---

## TUCKER:
She was a tattletale.

---

## LIZZIE:
I remember Sharon.

## BARBARA:
She was.

---

## TUCKER:
You were too little. 

---

## LIZZIE:
I remember.

## BARBARA:
They were both blonde.

---

## WEEZIE:
No… 

---

## TUCKER:
You’re thinking of Shauna, honey.

## BARBARA: 
And fat.

---

## LIZZIE:
No… I remember…

---

## WEEZIE:
Liz, it’s neurologically impossible for you to  remember&nbsp;—

---

## LIZZIE:
I REMEMBER EVERYTHING. 
	 


---

I’ll get my purse.
	



---

## WEEZIE:
I don’t know.
	
You’re supposed to believe your kids. 


---

## LIZZIE: 
Okey-dokey. Let’s go-key…

	

---

## BARBARA:
I am hereby disconnecting from you because you are suppressive to me. You invalidate me, belittle me, and seek to diminish.

---

## WEEZIE:
… Huh?

---

## BARBARA:
From this time forward, I consider myself disconnected from you. I do not wish to see or hear from you again. From now on, you do not exist in my life. 

	

---

## WEEZIE:
Alright. Okay.
	
Will you hand me my bag?

---

## BARBARA:
Pardon?

---

## WEEZIE:
My bag. 

	

---

## BARBARA:
Oh…um…sure. 

	

---

## WEEZIE:
Thanks.
	
See you at the funeral. 

---

## BARBARA: 
Right. See you there.
	
	

---

## TUCKER:
“A banquet of consequences.”

---

## BARBARA:
How’s the pain?

---

## TUCKER:
It’s fine. Unremarkable. 
	

---

It hurts so much, I can’t… I can barely see.

	

---

## BARBARA: 
Lie down, Tucker.

---

## TUCKER:
Yeah. I think I -. Just until the headache… yeah. 


---


## ANNIE:
Hi Barb.

---

## BARBARA:
OH MY GOD!

---

## ANNIE:
She forgot her bones. 

---

## BARBARA: 
…What?

---

## ANNIE: 
They’re seeping. They’re leaking juice…


	

---

## BARBARA:
…Nothingness doesn’t exist, so you can’t…you can’t be nothing. Nothing is the absence of something. Therefore we *are.* 

---

And if we are, then we choose. Choose what we know and what we un-know. There is power in unknowing, provided we actually *know* what we don't...know.


---

## ANNIE:
Thanks Barb.



---

## BARBARA: 
This group helped me.  

---

## ANNIE: 
By making you disconnect from your entire family&nbsp;—

---

## BARBARA: 
Well, sometimes you have to. If you’re dealing with a...a Suppressive Person, then you-

---

## ANNIE:
But isn’t declaring someone a “Suppressive” kind of like…suppressive?


---

## BARBARA:
Um&nbsp;— 


---

## ANNIE:
That’s pretty.

---

## BARBARA:
Alan designed it. There’s a tiny picture of the whole family…

---

## ANNIE:
Nice. What a nice man.



---

So, what are funerals like on your planet?

---

## BARBARA:
Uh…

---

## ANNIE: 
Are they weird? Do you wear masks or is it like a hooded robe situation?

---

## BARBARA:
Um, no…

---

## ANNIE: 
No to masks or no to robes?

---

## BARBARA:
No, it’s normal. It’s only normal.
We hold hands, tell stories…pray…

---

## ANNIE:
“Oh god of nothingness, bless our pyramid scheme…”
	
	

---

## BARBARA:
You are a spirit,
You are your own soul,
You are not mortal,
You can be free.


---

## ANNIE:
Who said that?

---

## BARBARA:
The father of our&nbsp;— our founder, actually.

---

## ANNIE:
Damn. I actually… I like that.

---

## BARBARA:
We believe the body is an impermanent vessel for the individual’s thetan. 


---

We believe that man has an immortal spirit that's… It’s unkillable. And the human body is, it’s like a coat. The coat isn’t you. You're a spirit inside the coat. Does that… ? 


---

Or, you know…
	



---

The body is a vegetable. It’s not sentient or conscious, it’s just a plant that grows from seed and has habit patterns which help it survive, and&nbsp;— just like any vegetable&nbsp;— one way or another, it gets used by people, and…




---

We die over and over again, and then we…we come back to life, and that’s&nbsp;— 
It’s a mercy. That we can do it again. It is a mercy that we are not&nbsp;— Because we’re not! We are not our bodies. We are&nbsp;— 

---

You and I&nbsp;— We’re not&nbsp;— I’m not…
	
I am not my body. My body is a coat. It’s… It’s a… It’s just a…a…a…a…a…


---

## ANNIE:
Just a coat.

---

## BARBARA:
Yeah.

---

## ANNIE:
Yeah.
