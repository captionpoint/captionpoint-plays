FREDERICK

Happy to!

Whoo hoo! Let's go! etc.

SUNNY
A 1, 2, 3!

NELLIE
Stop! Did you feel that?!

SUNNY
What?

NELLIE
A little breeze, slightly cooler than normal. Coming in from the northeast.

SUNNY
Oh Nellie! Everything's fine! It's still summer, don'tcha see?!

NELLIE
Yes … summer … late summer … but … still summer.
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL SUNNY DAY …

ERNEST & FREDERICK
SUNNY DAY!

SUNNY & BABY
SUNNY DAY!

NELLIE
Wait!
I smell it! A hint of rosemary and sage!

SUNNY
Nellie, no! The sky is wide-open! A blue canvas!
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL SUNNY DAY!

ERNEST & FREDERICK
SUNNY DAY!

BABY
SUNNY DAY!

SUNNY
NOT A CARE IN THE WORLD NOT A CLOUD IN THE SKY IT'S

ALL
SUMMER TIME

NELLIE
Stop!
I'm sorry to say it, but I feel a chill in the air. Summer is disappearing, friends. Fall is … nearly here.

SUNNY
No, Nellie. Summer is everywhere! Just look at that bee!

BABY
And look at that flower!
And … look at that bee on that flower! Uh oh!

FREDERICK
A butterfly! Oh, wow!

NELLIE
Did you see that, Ernest?! A leaf … a very big leaf …

ERNEST
Hold on, Nellie.

NELLIE
Sunny! Baby!
A leaf … a very big leaf …

SUNNY & BABY
Not now, Nellie!

NELLIE
Well, Frederick, then? Did you see it?
Frederick?!
My fellow mice! Don't you see?! A leaf has fallen. And you know what that means … don't you? Well, DON'T YOU?!??

ALL
Fall is here!

NELLIE

ERNEST
Saw it!
Must fill these to the brim if we are going to make it through winter! Sunny, come with me. You can be in charge of berries and straw!

SUNNY
On it!

NELLIE
I'll fill the water barrel! C'mon Baby, grab this seed bag!

BABY
Hiya, Frederick! You should watch where you're going!

FREDERICK
That's exactly what I'm doing.

BABY
Huh?

FREDERICK
Watching … observing … absorbing … You should try it sometime!

BABY
Yeah?

FREDERICK
Yes!

BABY
How do I do all that?

FREDERICK
Well … let's see.
Take … the sunrise.

BABY
Where should I take it?

FREDERICK
No, no, I mean—think about the sunrise. What do you think of when you think of the sunrise?

BABY
Sure is early.

FREDERICK
OK, but what about the …
Mmmm! And the …
Ahhh!

BABY
You're funny, Frederick!

FREDERICK
Hmm.
How can I say it? It's hard to find the words for feelings sometimes … All right. Let's try something else …
DIDJA SEE THAT?
DIDJA FEEL THAT?
CAN YOU SMELL THAT BREEZE? FEEL THE WAY THE GRASS IS TICKLING?
HEAR THE BUZZING BEES? EVERYONE SAYS, "HEY THERE FRED'RICK, GET TO WORK!" BUT HOW?
IT JUST SEEMS MORE IMPORTANT TO SAY WOW …
THE FISH ARE FLASHING IN THE STREAM …
I SEE THEM! THEY'RE SHINING!
IT'S LIKE I PAINT THEIR PICTURE IN MY MIND! A BRIGHT RED BERRY IN THE FIELD …
I TASTE IT! DELICIOUS!
I SCOOP UP EVERY MIRACLE I FIND!
WOW …
THE WAY THE BIRDS FLY LIKE THE MILKWEED! WOW …
THE WAY MY FUR WARMS IN THE SUN!
WOW …
THE FEELINGS UNDERNEATH THE BEAUTIFUL! SOMEONE'S GOT TO NOTICE, SO I GUESS I'LL BE THE ONE TO SAY WOW … JUST WOW …
I KNOW THE WINTER'S COMIN' CUZ THEY TELL ME! THEY SAY THAT!
BUT I KNOW LOTS OF OTHER THINGS ARE TRUE … SO I COLLECT THE COLORS OF THE FOREST! THE BARNYARD!
THE TINY SPARKLE IN A DROP OF DEW!
OH WOW …
THE WAY THE MOON SMILES IN THE TREETOPS! WOW …
THE WAY THE LOON SINGS DAY IS DONE WOW …
THE FEELINGS UNDERNEATH THE BEAUTIFUL! SOMEONE'S GOT TO NOTICE, SO I GUESS I'LL BE THE ONE TO SAY WOW …
JUST WOW …
You see what I mean?

BABY
Nope!

NELLIE
Baby! Where are you?!

BABY
Must be fun to daydream all the time!

FREDERICK
Is that what you think I'm doing?
Daydreaming?

BABY
All of our friends think so!

NELLIE
Baby?! Are you coming?

BABY
Gotta go!

FREDERICK
Daydreaming? That's what everyone thinks?

FREDERICK
Ants! Where are you marching off to today? You're so strong and … and … marchy! Look at you go! And listen to you chatter! What are you after there? A yummy crumb? Tasty, I'm sure! What's that you say, ant? You've got to get this tasty crumb to your anthill? You sure work hard. Wow!

ERNEST
Ahem, yes, well! Let's see here.
If this thing-a-ma-bob goes here … and this doo-dad goes there … aha! Then this whirly-gig will fit into the widget and the gizmo will attach to the whatcha-ma-callit! Perfect!
Ahem, Frederick, do you mind?!

FREDERICK
Oh, excuse me, Ernest! But do you see those ants? Look! They're incredibly strong and very chatty!

ERNEST
ANTS?
Really, Frederick. I'm hard at work on this year's invention! I can't reveal the details to you just yet, but, ahem, I can say that …
… it's gonna be big!!

SUNNY
Sorry, Ernest … exciting news!

BABY
Soooo exciting!

ERNEST
Well … ? Let's have it!

SUNNY & BABY
I—I—
We … !

ERNEST
Go on …

SUNNY
Down by the old barn!

BABY
The old barn!

SUNNY
Deep in the dirt!

BABY
So deep!

SUNNY
We found a big …

BABY
Big.

SUNNY
Big!

BABY
Big!

SUNNY & BABY
BIG ear of corn!

ALL
Yay, Sunny! Yay, Baby! Woo-hoo! Yay!

ERNEST
Fantastic news, Sunny! Wonderful work, Baby!

SUNNY
Only problem is, I'm on a seed gathering mission …
So I can't get it. And Baby can't drag it alone …
Frederick!? Can you go with Baby to fetch it?!

BABY
Great idea! Let's go, Frederick!

FREDERICK
Hold on, Baby!
Would you look at these leaves? Have you ever seen anything so … so …

SUNNY
So what, Frederick?

FREDERICK
So extraordinary! Such a deep orange!
And look at this fiery red!

ERNEST
Forget the leaves, Frederick! This is important! We need to get that ear of corn to our hideaway! It could be just the thing to get us through the winter.

BABY
Right! What are we waiting for?!

FREDERICK
Forget the leaves? Forget them? Ernest, no! We have to remember them! See how their colors are just so perfect? They won't look like this tomorrow.

ERNEST
Frederick! You should be collecting and gathering for the winter. Not playing around with leaves and ants!

FREDERICK
But I am collecting and gathering! Don't you see?

ERNEST
IF I MAY STATE THE OBVIOUS, IF I MIGHT CLARIFY, WHATEVER YOU'RE GATH'RIN', FREDERICK, IT FAILS TO MEET THE EYE!
YES IT BEHOOVES US TO BE SMART!
WE LABOR CUZ WE MUST!
GOTTA GATHER UP A WHOLE LOT MORE, MUCH MORE, THAN A POCKET FULLA DUST!

FREDERICK
WELL, JUST CUZ YOU CAN'T SEE IT DOESN'T MEAN THERE'S NOTHIN' THERE!
I PROMISE YOU I'M WORKIN' HARD!
COLLECTIN' TONS, I SWEAR!
I GUESS IT'S HARD BELIEVIN', BUT DEAR ERNEST, YOU CAN TRUST THAT I'M GATH'RIN' UP A WHOLE LOT MORE, MUCH MORE THAN A POCKET FULLA DUST!

SUNNY
CAN WE EAT THESE FINE SUPPLIES?

FREDERICK
SORRY, NO CAN DO …

BABY
CAN WE DRINK THEM? BUILD A NEST!?

FREDERICK
NO, THEY'RE NOT THAT KIND! THESE SUPPLIES ARE DIFF'RENT!

ERNEST
YES, THEY'RE THINGS YOU CAN SEE THROUGH!

FREDERICK
SOME THINGS AREN'T LIKE ALL THE REST! SOMEDAY, YOU WILL FIND …

SUNNY & BABY
FIND WHAT … ?!

FREDERICK
JUST CUZ YOU CAN'T TOUCH IT DOESN'T MEAN IT ISN'T REAL!
I SWEAR, THE STUFF IS PILIN' HIGH!!

ERNEST
THIS STUFF THAT'S NOT A MEAL!
YOUR CRAZY THINGS WILL FLY AWAY WITH JUST ONE WINTER GUST!

FREDERICK
I'M GATH'RIN' UP A WHOLE LOT MORE, MUCH MORE, THAN A POCKET FULLA DUST!

ERNEST
GOTTA GATHER UP A WHOLE LOT MORE,

SUNNY & BABY
MUCH MORE!

ALL
THAN A POCKET FULLA DUST!

ERNEST
You really could be useful, Frederick; if only you would try.

BABY
It's OK, Frederick! I can get that corn all by myself!
I'll drag it to our hideaway in no time!

SUNNY
May I keep this one?

FREDERICK
Of course! They belong to all of us.
But, Sunny?

SUNNY
Yes?

FREDERICK
Try to keep hold of the color in your mind. Remember, it won't look the same tomorrow.

SUNNY
OK, Frederick. Thanks.

FREDERICK
Oh … wow!
Hi, Nellie!
Take a look at that!
What do you see?

NELLIE
A cloud.

FREDERICK
Not what do you see … what do you seeeee?

NELLIE
A white cloud?

FREDERICK
I see a big, cozy puff of cotton that I could just sink into for a lonnng nap—ahh!

NELLIE
Uhh!

FREDERICK
Is everything all right, Nellie? You seem … upset.

NELLIE
I am upset. And worried. Very worried. I don't know if we'll have enough food to get us through the winter.

FREDERICK
Good thing Sunny and Baby found that big ear of corn!

NELLIE
What?! Big ear of corn? That's the best news I've heard all day! Where is it?

FREDERICK
Back behind the barn!

NELLIE
Did they go fetch it?

FREDERICK
Sunny was too busy. So was Ernest.
Baby went for it.

NELLIE
Baby?! But Baby's not strong enough! Why didn't you go? You're … available … far as I can tell!

FREDERICK
Oh Nellie! I'm at a very important moment in my supply-collecting. Those clouds will soon turn gray and these leaves will curl and crack. You see, there's not a lot of time left!

NELLIE
Exactly! That's what I'm trying to tell you! We need you to get down to the barn and help Baby with that corn!

FREDERICK
But what I'm collecting is a little bit different, Nellie.
It's, um, it's hard to explain.

NELLIE
Try.

FREDERICK
OK … you see … these colors and sounds, these feelings and smells that I've been gathering up all summer and fall are so … so powerful that even in the darkest hour of winter, we will have … we will have …

NELLIE
We will have what?

FREDERICK
Something special.
You see?

NELLIE
What I see … what I know is that in the darkest hour of winter, we had better have enough corn and seeds and nuts and berries, because food is the only thing that will get us through.
And now, thanks to our little chat, I'm behind with my collecting for the day.
If you know what's good for you, Frederick, you'll go help Baby with that corn!

FREDERICK
Oh, wow!

NELLIE
Ernest?
Sunny!?
BABY MOUSE!?

BABY
Present!

NELLIE
Sorry, Baby! I didn't see you there!

BABY
It's OK!

NELLIE
Help me get this water to the hideaway; then I'll help you, Baby.

BABY
Everybody's. So. Busy. I. Can. Do. It.

NELLIE
Not everybody.

BABY
Yes! Everybody!

NELLIE
I wouldn't call Frederick "busy" exactly.

BABY
Oh sure he is. Gathering … you know … whatever it is he's gathering.

NELLIE
Gathering? Hmm. I don't think so.

BABY
Sure he is!
After all, he's part of the team.

NELLIE
Part of the team—my tail! Frederick thinks only of himself! Frederick is …
selfish!

BABY
He is?

NELLIE
Baby, here you are trying to move this big ear of corn all by your tiny, little self.

BABY
Hey!

NELLIE
And where's Frederick?

BABY
I told you! He's off doing Frederick things.

NELLIE
Well, he should be here helping you! And, yes, I'm sorry, but that's selfish. Come on. I'll help you with this corn.
And the hideaway's that way.

BABY
Awww, nuts and berries!!

FREDERICK
Selfish?

NELLIE
LOOK AT HIM HE'S LOOKING AT THE CLOUDS AGAIN!
FRED'RICK HARDLY EVER LIFTS A PAW NEVER WORKING, NEVER BUSY LIKE HIS FRIENDS! LAZ'IEST LITTLE MOUSE YOU EVER SAW!
LOOK AT FRED'RICK, ALL HE DOES IS SIT AND DREAM …
LOOK AT NELLIE, JEALOUS OF HOW NICE THAT SEEMS …
FIELD MICE SCURRY IMAGINING THE FLURRIES WHEN WINTERTIME IS COMIN' FAST …
BUT I'M THE MOUSE WHO HURRIES!
CUZ I'M THE MOUSE WHO WORRIES OUR FOOD SUPPLIES WILL NEVER LAST!
SOME MICE ARE CHEERFUL AND SOME NEVER FEARFUL AND ALL OF US STACK THE WOOD …
BUT SOME MICE DREAM LIKE FRED'RICK DREAMS AND SOME MICE WISH WE COULD …
WHAT WOULD I SEE THROUGH FRED'RICK'S EYES?
WONDER HOW THE WORLD WOULD BE? HAPPY AND FREE THROUGH FRED'RICK'S EYES WITH NOTHIN' EVER WORRYIN' ME …
LOOK AT HIM SMILING! THE CORN HE ISN'T PILING!
WATCH HIM NOT GATHERING SEEDS!
LOOK AT ME SWEATIN'!
THE FRETTING I AM FRETTIN'!
WHILE FRED'RICK'S PICKIN' FLOWERS WE DON'T NEED!!
MOST MICE ARE WORKERS!
GOT NO TIME FOR SHIRKERS!
WE LABOR FOR COMMUNITY GOOD!
BUT SOME MICE DREAM LIKE FRED'RICK DREAMS AND SOME MICE WISH WE COULD …
WHAT WOULD I SEE THROUGH FRED'RICK'S EYES?
WONDER HOW THE WORLD WOULD BE? HAPPY AND FREE THROUGH FRED'RICK'S EYES WITH NOTHIN' EVER WORRYIN' ME … NOTHIN' EVER WORRYIN' ME …

ERNEST
Well done, my friends. A good day of collecting and gathering!
This represents exactly half of what we need to get us through the winter.

BABY
Only half?!
There! Now are we done?

NELLIE
Hardly, Baby. And what's more, we are behind schedule. Winter will be here in a couple of weeks.

ERNEST
No need to panic. As I said, we have half of what we need.
According to my calculations, if every one of us works our very hardest, we should be able to collect the other half before winter arrives.

NELLIE
Every one of us?
Not likely.

SUNNY
All it takes is a little team work!

BABY
So, what are we waiting for?! Let's get back out there!

ERNEST
But that's mathematically impossible!

ALL
Winter's come early!

NELLIE
We're not ready! We're doomed!

SUNNY
Nellie! Baby! Everything's going to be just fine!
We have food. We have water.
We are going to be OK!!!

NELLIE
But we only have half of what we need. You heard what Ernest said!

ERNEST
Perhaps my invention can help pull us through the winter! It just needs to be REvamped and REtooled to REcalculate …
Let's see … more long, cold, winter days … less food … ack! The machine will figure it out!
Not to worry … I'll be at the hideaway getting things set up!

NELLIE
We've got to get Baby to the hideaway. Sunny, can you take her there?

SUNNY
Sure, Nellie, shouldn't you come along with us?

NELLIE
I'll stay out a little longer and stock as many supplies as possible.
Every last seed counts now, Sunny.

SUNNY
C'mon. Let's get you to where it's warm.

BABY
But what about Frederick?!

NELLIE
Go on. I'll keep an eye out for him.

SUNNY
If Nellie can't find him, Frederick will surely follow our tracks to the winter hideaway. He's clever like that …

BABY
He sure IS clever …

SUNNY
Let's go, Baby! See you at the hideaway, Nellie!

NELLIE
But the snow will cover up our tracks …
He won't be able to find his way.
Frederick! Oh, Frederick!
Where can you be?!

FREDERICK
Sunny! Baby! Ernest! Nellie!
I wish they were here—it's beautiful!
If Nellie could be here now, looking at this beautiful snow with me, then she'd understand. Wouldn't she? Or would she still think I'm selfish?
I know!
I'll just collect more and more of my supplies until they can all see them and feel them like I do!
It's sooo beautiful …
and cold.

SUNNY
I think I see Nellie!

BABY
Hooray! Is Frederick with her?

SUNNY
Umm … hmmmm …

SUNNY
Nellie! Thank goodness you made it back safe!

ERNEST
You were out so long in the cold! But look how much more you gathered!

NELLIE
I tried my best …

BABY
Hooray for Nellie! Hooray for Nellie!

SUNNY
Let us help you with those!

BABY
Um … Where's Frederick?

NELLIE
I looked all over for him. I went to all his favorite places: to the edge of the meadow, and down by the granary, near the brook—which is already frozen by the way …

SUNNY
Oh, he'll be along. Frederick likes to do things in his own way. He's probably looking at a snowflake!

BABY
That Frederick!

ERNEST
He'll be along, Nellie. You'll see …

NELLIE
I hope so. But that's not all I'm worried about! Even with what I brought, we still don't have enough food to make it until spring.

ERNEST
Stop your fretting! I've thought of that! I've thought of everything! Conservation is the key! Conservation and ration-i-zation!

BABY
Ration-i-zation?
What's that??

ERNEST
It means eating only what you need today. So you'll have some left for tomorrow!

NELLIE
Easier said than done.

ERNEST
Aha! That's where you're wrong, my friend!
Gather 'round, everyone!

ALL
Yes? What is it, Ernest?

ERNEST
You may have noticed that I've been working very diligently and painstakingly on this year's invention!

ALL
We sure have! Yes! Absolutely!

ERNEST
This may be my finest invention so far!
My most elegant and decadent, my most stream-lined and hard-to-define, my most sys-te-ma-tic and free-of-static …

BABY
Show us, Ernest! Show us!

ERNEST
Drum-roll please!
Friends, with the help of my INVENTION, we will have JUST enough food to SQUEAK through the winter! Witness …
"The Nut and Seed Ration-ator 5000"!!

BABY
5000? Wow!

SUNNY
Sure does sound important!

BABY
Sure does look important!

NELLIE
But what does it do?

ERNEST
Ahem … I'm glad you asked …
SMART MICE LIKE ME LOVE GADGETRY! COME SEE WHAT I CREATED!
WHY SETTLE JUST FOR SIMPLE THINGS? LET'S MAKE IT COMPLICATED!
THIS PART PICKS UP WHAT THIS THING DROPS WHEN THIS THING SPINS AROUND!
WITH ALL MY GREAT INVENTIONS THERE IS ONE THING THAT I'VE FOUND …
BELLS AND WHISTLES! YA GOTTA HAVE A TON!
COOL INVENTIONS GET THE JOB DONE!
GOT A PROBLEM? NEVER FEAR! JUST CALL IN AN ENGINEER!
BELLS AND WHISTLES ALL THE WAY!
THIS THING IS REALLY GENIUS TAKES THE LABOR OUTTA DINNER!
NO NEED TO USE YOUR PAWS IT SCOOPS THE SEEDS INTO THE SPINNER! THEY SLIDE RIGHT DOWN THESE CHUTES AND EQUAL SERVINGS FILL THE BOWLS! AND THESE PROTECTIVE COVERS KEEP THE FOOD SAFE FROM THE MOLES!!

ERNEST & SUNNY
BELLS AND WHISTLES! YA GOTTA HAVE A TON!
INNOVATIONS GET THE JOB DONE!
GOT A PROBLEM? NEVER FEAR! JUST CALL IN AN ENGINEER!
BELLS AND WHISTLES ALL THE WAY!

ERNEST
IT'S MAYBE GOT SOME WRINKLES AND SOME VERY MINOR KINKS BUT SCIENCE NEVER BOTHERS CARIN' WHAT THE PUBLIC THINKS!
I MIGHT WORK ON AN UPGRADE THAT'S THE BEST INVENTION YET!
JUST WAIT FOR VERSION 6.8 THEY'LL STAND IN LINE I BET!

ALL
BELLS AND WHISTLES! YA GOTTA HAVE A TON!
COOL INVENTIONS GET THE JOB DONE!

NELLIE, SUNNY & BABY
GOT A PROBLEM? NEVER FEAR!

ERNEST
JUST CALL IN AN ENGINEER!

ALL
BELLS AND WHISTLES ALL THE WAY!

NELLIE, SUNNY & BABY
BELLS AND WHISTLES ALL THE WAY!

ALL
BELLS AND WHISTLES ALL THE WAY! YEAH!

BABY
Don't worry, Ernest, this way works, too!

ERNEST
Hmm. Yes. That's exactly what we're trying to avoid.
Sunny, help me with this, will you?

NELLIE
C'mon, Baby. I brought along your toys.

FREDERICK
That's strange. I can't seem to find any of my supplies out here. Where is everyone?
And where am I?
I'm so cold and alone. I can't even feel my paws or my tail.
Everything is … frozen.

SUNNY
Morning, everyone.

ERNEST
Morning!

BABY
Morning …

SUNNY
That chilly wind is blowing all right! Brrr!

NELLIE
Frederick must have been out there all night. I knew the snow would cover our tracks! He's probably lost!

SUNNY
Nellie, you're making everyone nervous!

BABY
But where is he?

ERNEST
I'm sure Frederick found a warm little nest for the night. Not to worry!

SUNNY
Yes, Frederick probably found his very own hideaway!

ERNEST
Now! We have things to do. I need to make some repairs to my machine. Nellie, how about bringing me those nuts and seeds?

BABY
I just wish he would get here …

SUNNY
Let's think about something else, Baby. How about a story?

BABY
A story! A story!

SUNNY
Let's see … Let me think of a good one. Aha! "The Silly Cat"!

BABY
Hooray!

SUNNY
There once was a silly cat who chased her tail all day long.

BABY
Silly!

SUNNY
Oh how she chased that tail! She chased it and chased it.

BABY
Silly! Silly!

SUNNY
And chased it and chased it and chased it!

BABY
Silly! Silly! Silly!

SUNNY
And chased it and chased it and chased it and chased it …
But then, one day, the silly cat really wanted to chase something else.

BABY
Oh?

SUNNY
She wanted to chase something new and different …

BABY
Uh oh.

SUNNY
She wanted to chase something small and furry and warm …

BABY
Oh no.

SUNNY
She wanted to chase …
A mouse!

NELLIE
Let me try.
"The Foolish Fox"!

BABY
Hooray.

NELLIE
There once was a foolish fox!

BABY
Yay!

NELLIE
And this foolish fox seemed to be hungry all the time.

BABY
Yes?

NELLIE
At breakfast time, he ate his breakfast … but he was still hungry …

BABY
Yes?

NELLIE
So, he ate his lunch, too!

BABY
How foolish!

NELLIE
But when lunch time came, there was no lunch!

BABY
Of course.

NELLIE
So, he ate his dinner, too!

BABY
Sooo foolish!

NELLIE
And when dinner time came, there was no dinner!

BABY
Of course!

NELLIE
In fact, there was no breakfast, lunch or dinner!

BABY
Uh oh.

NELLIE
There was nothing left to eat at all.

BABY
Oh no.

NELLIE
SO … the fox snuck into a nearby hideaway—

BABY
Oh no, no.

NELLIE
Where some little mice had stored up all their food for the winter—

BABY
Oh no, no, no.

NELLIE
AND HE ATE IT ALL UP. EVERY LAST MORSEL. LEAVING NOTHING, JUST NOTHING FOR THE POOR LITTLE MICE!

BABY
I miss Frederick! Even if he is selfish!

ERNEST
Baby! That's not a word we use in the mouse community.

BABY
But that's what Nellie said about Frederick.

SUNNY
Nellie, is that true?

NELLIE
Well, yes, I did call him selfish, but only because we were all doing our fair share and he wasn't doing anything. Baby, remember the corn? How you had to do all that work on your own?

BABY
Yes … But … Frederick makes me laugh!

NELLIE
Well … that may be—

SUNNY
And Frederick always has something clever to say!

NELLIE
Well, yes, but he's always staring down at the ground or up into the sky, or …

ERNEST
That's right—he is! Always so, SO curious!
Very inspiring, I must admit.

NELLIE
I guess I never noticed those things.

SUNNY
Maybe you were so busy looking at the things he WASN'T doing, that you couldn't see all the things he WAS doing.

BABY
I miss Frederick.

SUNNY
He must feel so scared.

ERNEST
And cold.

NELLIE
And alone.

SUNNY
Oh dear.

BABY
Oh dearie dear.

NELLIE
We can't wait any longer! If he can't find us, we'll have to find him.

ERNEST
But it's too cold and dangerous out there, Nellie—snow drifts up to our snouts!

SUNNY
That storm has whipped itself into a frenzy.

NELLIE
This is all my fault for calling him selfish! I'll just have to go alone!

SUNNY
No, Nellie! You're just starting to thaw out!

ERNEST
I was the first one to our hideaway; I'm the warmest! I should be the one to go out!
Yes, that settles it! I'll go!

NELLIE
You can't go out there! We need you here, Ernest, to fix the machine!

ERNEST
The machine isn't what's important right now. It's just ropes and clamps and lights …

BABY
I know! I know! I'm fast and light and I won't sink in the snow! So I'll go!

NELLIE
That's very sweet of you, Baby, but no. I don't think so.

BABY
But … Frederick would do it for us! I know he would.

SUNNY
Baby's right! Frederick would go out in the storm for us! And that's exactly why not a single one of us is going out to look for Frederick …

ALL
But—wait a second … What do you mean? I'm confused … Didn't you just say …

SUNNY
Right! You heard me! Not just one of us is going to look for Frederick … We're all going to look for Frederick!

ALL
OH! Hooray! Let's go! OK! We're coming, Frederick!

ERNEST
And I know just how we'll face this storm!

ALL
Ernest! What are you doing!? Your machine!!

ERNEST
It's OK, my friends! These parts might help us to find Frederick … You see?
Hey! Look at that!
My machine just might be useful, after all! Come, lend a paw!

ALL
Great idea, Ernest! C'mon everybody! Grab this part here! Here's some rope! Take this clamp!

FREDERICK
WHAT HAPPENED TO MY COLORS? WHERE DID I PUT MY SOUNDS?
THE WORLD FEELS WAY LESS MAGICAL TODAY … I FEEL SO COLD AND LONELY WITHOUT MY FRIENDS AROUND …
IN SNOW THE SMELL OF ROSES BLOWS AWAY …
THE THINGS I FELT AND SAW ARE SLIPPING THROUGH MY PAWS
MY FRIENDS ALL GATHER STUFF WHAT I BRING'S NOT ENOUGH! THE MOUSE I USED TO BE JUST DOESN'T FEEL LIKE ME ANYMORE …
MY EYES AND EARS AND NOSE HAVE ALWAYS KEPT ME REALLY BUSY GATH'RING ALL MY BEAUTIFUL SUPPLIES …
BUT NOW I'M LOST AND SCARED, WALKING IN CIRCLES TILL I'M DIZZY AND WHEN I FEEL MY POCKETS I'M SURPRISED … THEY'RE EMPTY …
I THINK I LOST … MY MEMORIES THEY SCATTERED IN THE STORM I SHOULD HAVE BEEN COLLECTING THINGS TO EAT THE OTHER MICE WERE SMARTER THEY'RE SOMEWHERE SAFE AND WARM AND ALL I'VE GOT IS ME WITH FROZEN FEET …
THE THINGS I SAW AND HEARD HAVE FLOWN OFF WITH THE BIRDS THE THINGS I THOUGHT WERE REAL CAN'T REALLY BE … REVEALED … THE THINGS I USED TO THINK AREN'T WHAT I THINK I THINK ANYMORE …

NELLIE
Frederick!!!

BABY
Frederick, where are you?

ERNEST
Can you hear us, Frederick?

SUNNY
Hey everybody, we've gotta find Frederick! Can you help us?

AUDIENCE

SUNNY

OUR FRIEND WE CANNOT FIND!

AUDIENCE

SUNNY
NO MOUSE GETS LEFT BEHIND!

AUDIENCE
NO MOUSE GETS LEFT BEHIND!

SUNNY

ALL
WHERE ARE YOU FRED'RICK?? OUR FRIEND WE CANNOT FIND! DON'T WORRY FRED'RICK!! NO MOUSE GETS LEFT BEHIND!

NELLIE
Baby, do you see him at the edge of the meadow?

BABY
I—I—
No.

SUNNY
Ernest, what about down at the granary?

ERNEST
That is a negatory, Sunny.

BABY
Nellie, is he near the brook?

NELLIE
I don't see him!

ERNEST
Sunny, what about over by the haystacks?

SUNNY
I think I see something! Follow me!

ALL
WHERE ARE YOU FRED'RICK?? OUR FRIEND WE CANNOT FIND! DON'T WORRY FRED'RICK!! NO MOUSE GETS LEFT BEHIND!
WE FOUND YOU FRED'RICK! JUST LIKE WE KNEW WE WOULD WE STICK TOGETHER JUST LIKE A FAMILY SHOULD!

ERNEST
Are you all right?

SUNNY
Are you hurt?

FREDERICK
No. Just cold.

SUNNY
Come. We'll warm you.

ERNEST
Here you go.

FREDERICK
Thank you, Ernest.

NELLIE
We were so worried about you.

BABY
Where were you, Frederick?

FREDERICK
I was looking for supplies.

NELLIE
There aren't any supplies to find out there now, Frederick. It's too late.

ERNEST
Well …
We're glad you're here. That's the important thing!

BABY
Frederick is here! Frederick is here!

SUNNY
You always have something delightful to say. How about you tell us a story?

BABY
Yes, a story from Frederick! A story! A story!

FREDERICK
I'm sorry, my friends, but I think I've lost all my supplies.

SUNNY
Oh, Frederick …

ERNEST
All right … All right … I'll tell a story.

BABY
A story from Frederick, yes.
A story from any of you … no.

ERNEST
Oh, you'll like this one, Baby! It's funny!

BABY
OK…

ERNEST
There once was a cranky, old rabbit …
You can't laugh yet!

BABY
But I know this story, and you're right—it is funny!

ERNEST
Well, I haven't gotten to the end!
One day, this cranky, old rabbit …

NELLIE
Baby!!!

SUNNY
Let her laugh. What's the harm?

ERNEST
If she starts laughing now, there'll be no laughing for later!

FREDERICK
But that's not how laughter works.

ERNEST
That is exactly how laughter works! It doesn't grow on trees. It must be earned! Now … I'm going to teach you how to enjoy a good story! So! Here we go …
There once was a cranky, old rabbit …
Remember. You must wait for the ending before you laugh!
Now. This rabbit was … actually it may have been a hare. A rabbit or a hare I can't remember.
In any case it was brown. Brownish red to be exact and the, well the rabbit, or hare, it doesn't much matter.
This animal—this rodent really—although they never think of themselves that way. So high and mighty are THEY. Rabbits don't even consider themselves part of the rodent family …
Where was I?

NELLIE
This rodent …

ERNEST
This rodent decided to go for a walk one day. A small hop, if you will.
But! You see! The thing was … he was afraid. Yes! Afraid of his own shadow. And so he ended up back in his own little hole without ever taking a single step. The end!
Go on! Laugh. Now you laugh!

NELLIE
You see? Baby's used up all the laughing!

SUNNY
Maybe she's just tired.

NELLIE
We've run out of stories! And now we've run out of … joy!

FREDERICK
But that's impossible … You can't run out of joy.

NELLIE
WHEN FOOD IS GONE AND THE WALL'S GROWN COLD …
WHEN LIGHT FADES FROM THE CRACKS … WHEN CORN IS JUST A MEMORY IT'S TIME TO FACE THE FACTS …
THE GAMES WE PLAY DON'T MAKE US LAUGH AND TALKING IS A CHORE …
CUZ NO ONE FEELS LIKE CHATTING ANYMORE …
YES WINTER IS SUCH A MEAN OLD MAN … MUCH TOUGHER THAN WE KNEW …
THE DAYS TURN INTO FRIGID WEEKS AND WE MIGHT NOT PULL THROUGH …
THEN MONTHS THEY CREEP ON CHILLY FEET TILL WE JUST CAN'T ENDURE …
HOW NO ONE FEELS LIKE CHATTING ANYMORE …

SUNNY
I feel … lonely. Even though you are all here.

BABY
I sure wish we had something special … something that would make this feeling go away.

ERNEST
This, my friends, is the darkest hour of winter.

NELLIE
Wait a minute … darkest hour of winter … something special … ? Frederick, you said that the supplies you've been collecting all summer and fall were for the darkest hour of winter. So we would have something special.

FREDERICK
I told you, Nellie. I think I lost them.

NELLIE
Lost them?
You say you lost them?

FREDERICK
I think so, yes.

NELLIE
Well if they can be lost, then they can be found again. Just like we found you!

FREDERICK
I guess …

NELLIE
And if they can be found and then lost, and lost and then found, then, my goodness, Frederick … they must be real!

FREDERICK
They've always been real to me …

NELLIE
Do you think you can find them again? For us? Now?

FREDERICK
I can try.

BABY
Frederick is going to show us his supplies!

NELLIE
Go on …

FREDERICK
Close your eyes everyone.
Listen to the sound of my voice …
I'm bringing you the warmth of the sun.
Do you feel the golden glow blanketing your cold little feet?

SUNNY
Yes, Frederick!

FREDERICK
Do you feel the yellow rays on your fur?

ERNEST
Ohh ho! It almost tickles!

FREDERICK
Do you feel the heat of the summer sun?
Warming your very soul … ?

BABY
So cozy!

FREDERICK
I bring you the rays of the sun! Warm and yellow … soft and golden … pure and simple!

SUNNY
Lovely!

ERNEST
Delightful!

BABY
MMMMM …

NELLIE
What about the colors, Frederick?

FREDERICK
Close your eyes …

ALL
OK, yes, we will, ready!

FREDERICK
Remember the pale yellow wheat swaying in the late spring breeze …

ALL
Ooooh.

FREDERICK
See the red poppies blooming in the summer rain!

ALL
Aaaah …

FREDERICK
And now, picture in your mind the deep purple of the bush berries …

ALL
Mmmmm.

NELLIE
And the words, Frederick? What about the words?

FREDERICK
I'll try … Gather 'round.
WHO SCATTERS SNOWFLAKES? WHO MELTS THE ICE? WHO SPOILS THE WEATHER? WHO MAKES IT NICE? WHO GROWS THE FOUR-LEAF CLOVERS IN JUNE? WHO DIMS THE DAYLIGHT? WHO LIGHTS THE MOON?
FOUR LITTLE FIELD MICE WHO LIVE IN THE SKY. FOUR LITTLE FIELD MICE … LIKE YOU AND I.
ONE IS THE SPRING MOUSE WHO TURNS ON THE SHOWERS
THEN COMES THE SUMMER WHO PAINTS IN THE FLOWERS.
THE FALL MOUSE IS NEXT WITH WALNUTS AND WHEAT.
THE WINTER IS LAST WITH … COLD LITTLE FEET.

FREDERICK & NELLIE
AREN'T WE LUCKY THE SEASONS ARE FOUR? THINK OF A YEAR WITH ONE LESS … OR ONE MORE!

ALL
AREN'T WE LUCKY THE SEASONS ARE FOUR? THINK OF A YEAR WITH ONE LESS … OR ONE MORE!

BABY
Hey!
One, two, three, four, five—five little field mice, Frederick! Including you!
Wait a minute … What's that??

NELLIE
Is it?

ERNEST
Could it be?

SUNNY
It is! It is!

BABY
Spring is here!

ALL
We made it!!!

BABY
What are we waiting for?

SUNNY
Let's get out there!

NELLIE
Come on!

ERNEST
Yippie!

BABY
The grass is tickling my paws!

SUNNY
Listen to the buzzing bees!

ERNEST
And the stream—it's sparkling in the sun!

NELLIE
Frederick, I thought you might want these back.
You're … an artist.

ERNEST
A poet!

FREDERICK
It was you, my friends, who helped me to know it.

BABY & SUNNY
Frederick!

FREDERICK
You see? There's no such thing as running out of joy!

ERNEST
The more you use …

NELLIE
The more you make!
WHY DID I EVER WORRY?
WHY DID I EVER DOUBT?
THIS THING THAT FRED'RICK ALWAYS KNEW:

ERNEST & SUNNY
