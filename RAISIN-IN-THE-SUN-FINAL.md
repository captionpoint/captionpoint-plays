---

Sounds of the South Side. A vacuum whirring, a laundry machine running, a bird chirps.

---

## RUTH:
Wake up Travis. Come on now boy. Come on now, boy, it's seven-thirty! 

---


I say hurry up, Travis! You ain't the only person in the world got to use a bathroom!

---


Walter Lee, lemme see you do some waking up in there now!

---


You better get up from there, man! It's after seven thirty, I tell you.


---

Alright, you just go ahead and lay there and next thing you know Travis be finished and Mr. Johnson'll be in there and you'll be fussing and cussing round here like a madman! And be late, too -!

---


Walter Lee - it's time for you to get up!


---

## WALTER:
Is he out yet-?


---

## RUTH:
What you mean, out? He ain't hardly got in there good yet.


---

## WALTER:
Well, what was you doing all that yelling for if I can't even get in there yet?
Check coming today?


---

## RUTH:
They said Saturday and this is just Friday and I hopes to God you ain't going to get up here first thing this morning and start talking to me 'bout no money-'cause I 'bout don't want to hear it.


---

## WALTER:
Something the matter with you this morning?


---

## RUTH:
No – I’m just sleepy as the devil. What kind of eggs you want?


---

## WALTER:
Not scrambled.
Paper come?
Set off another A-bomb yesterday.


---

## RUTH:
Did they?

---

## WALTER:
What’s the matter with you?


---

## RUTH:
Ain't nothing the matter with me. And don't keep asking me.


---

## WALTER:
Ain’t nobody bothering you.
Say Colonel McCormick is sick.


---

## RUTH:
Is he now? Poor thing.


---

## WALTER:
Now what is that boy doing in that bathroom all this time? 

---

He is just going to have to start getting up earlier. I can't be being late to work on account of him fooling around in there. 


---

## RUTH:
Oh, no, he ain't going to be getting up no earlier no such thing! 

---

It ain't his fault that he can't get to bed 'cause he got a bunch of crazy good-for-nothing clowns running their mouths in what is supposed to be his bedroom after ten o'clock at night – 



---

## WALTER:
That's what you're mad about, ain't it? 
The things I want to talk about with my friends just couldn't be important in your mind, could they?


---

## RUTH:
Why you always got to smoke before you eat in the morning?

---


## WALTER:
Just look at 'em down there - running and racing to work – 
You look young this morning, Baby. 

---


## RUTH:
Yeah?


---

## WALTER:
Just for a second - stirring them eggs. Just for a second it was - you looked real young again. 

---


## TRAVIS:
It's gone now - you look like yourself again!


---

## RUTH:
Man, if you don’t shut up and leave me alone.


---

## WALTER:
First thing a man ought to learn in life is not to make love to no colored woman first thing in the morning. Y'all some evil people at eight o'clock in the morning.


---

## TRAVIS:
Daddy, come on!


---

## RUTH:
Sit down and have your breakfast, Travis.


---

## TRAVIS:
Mama, this is Friday, 
Check coming tomorrow, huh?


---

## RUTH:
You get your mind off money and eat your breakfast.


---

## TRAVIS:
This is the morning we supposed to bring the fifty cents to school.


---

## RUTH:
Well, I ain’t got no fifty cents this morning.


---

## TRAVIS:
Teacher say we have to.


---

## RUTH:
I don’t care what teacher say. I ain’t got it. Eat your breakfast, Travis.


---

## TRAVIS:
I am eating.


---

## RUTH:
Hush up now and just eat!


---

## TRAVIS:
You think Grandmama would have it?


---

## RUTH:
No! And I want you to stop asking your grandmother for money, you hear me?


---

## TRAVIS:
Gaaaleee! I don’t ask her, she just gimme it sometimes!


---

## RUTH:
TRAVIS WILLARD YOUNGER – I got too much on me this morning to be – 


---

## TRAVIS:
Maybe Daddy – 


---

## RUTH:
Travis!

---

## TRAVIS:
Could I maybe go carry some groceries in front of the supermarket after school, then?


---

## RUTH:
Just hush, I said.
If you're through eating you can make up your bed.


---

## TRAVIS:
I’m gone.


---

## RUTH:
Come here. 
If you don't take this comb and fix this here head you better!
'Bout to march out of here with that head looking like chickens slept in it! I just don't know where you get your stubborn ways.


---

## TRAVIS:
I’m gone.


---

## RUTH:
And get your jacket, too. Looks chilly out this morning. Get your carfare and milk money - and not one penny for no caps, you hear me?


---

## TRAVIS:
Yes'm.


---

## RUTH:
Oh, Mama makes me so mad sometimes I don't know what to do!
I wouldn't kiss that woman good-bye this morning not for nothing in this world!
Not for nothing in this world!


---

Now - whose little old angry man are you?


---

## TRAVIS:
Aw Gaalee - Mama -


---

## RUTH:
Aw - Gaaaalleeeeee, Mama! 
Get on out of here or you going to be late.


---

## TRAVIS:
Mama, could I please go carry groceries?



---

## RUTH:
Honey, it's starting to get so chilly these evenings.


---

## WALTER:
What is it he wants to do?


---

## RUTH:
Go carry groceries at the supermarket.


---

## WALTER:
Well, let him go -


---

## TRAVIS:
I have to - she won't gimme the fifty cents -


---

## WALTER:
Why not -?


---

## RUTH:
'Cause we don't have it.


---

## WALTER:
What you tell the boy things like that for?
Here, son-


---

## TRAVIS:
Thanks, Daddy.


---

## WALTER:
In fact, here's another fifty cents - Buy yourself some fruit today - or take a taxi­ cab to school or something!


---

## TRAVIS:
Whoopee -


---

## WALTER:
You better get down now - and get to school, man.


---

## TRAVIS:
O.K. Good-bye. 


---

## WALTER:
That's my boy.
You know what I was thinking 'bout in the bathroom this morning -?


---

## RUTH:
No.


---

## WALTER:
How come you always try to be so pleasant!


---

## RUTH:
What is there to be pleasant 'bout! 


---

## WALTER:
You want to know what I was thinking 'bout in the bathroom or not!


---

## RUTH:
I know what you was thinking 'bout.


---

## WALTER:
'Bout what me and Willy Harris was talking about last night.


---

## RUTH:
Willy Harris is a good for nothing loud mouth.


---

## WALTER:
Anybody who talks to me has got to be a good for nothing loud mouth, ain't he? And what you know about who's a good for nothing loud mouth? 

---

Charlie Atkins was just a "good for nothing loud mouth" too, wasn't he! When he wanted me to go in the dry-cleaning business with him. 

---

And now-he's grossing $100,000 a year. $100,000 a year! You still call him a loudmouth?!


---

## RUTH:
Oh, Walter Lee – 


---

## WALTER:
You tired, ain't you? Tired of everything. Me, the boy, the way we live - this beat up hole - everything. Ain't you?

---


So tired - moaning and groaning all the time but you wouldn't do nothing to help, would you? You couldn't be on my side that long for nothing, could you?


---

## RUTH:
Walter, please leave me alone.


---

## WALTER:
A man needs for a woman to back him up -


---

## RUTH:
Walter -


---

## WALTER:
Mama would listen to you. You know she listen to you more than she do me and Bennie. She think more of you. 

---

All you have to do is just sit down with her when you drinking your coffee and talking 'bout things like you do and – 

---


You just sip your coffee, see, and say easy like that you been thinking 'bout that deal Walter Lee is so interested in, 'bout the store and all, and sip some more coffee, 

---

like what you saying ain't that important to you. And the next thing you know she listening good and asking you questions and when I come home - 

---

I can tell her the details. This ain't no fly-by-night proposition, Baby. I mean we figured it out, me, Willy and Bobo.


---

## RUTH:
Bobo -?


---

## WALTER:
Yeah. You see, this little liquor store cost $75,000 and we figured the initial investment on the place be 'bout $30,000, see. 

---

Ten thousand each. Course, there's a couple of hundred you got to pay so's you don't spend your life waiting for them clowns to get your license approved -


---

## RUTH:
You mean graft?


---

## WALTER:
Don't call it that. See there, that just goes to show you what women understand about the world. Baby, don't nothing happen for you in this world 'less you pay somebody off!


---

## RUTH:
Walter, leave me alone! 
Eat your eggs, they gonna be cold.


---

## WALTER:
You see that? Man says to his woman: I got me a dream. His woman say: Eat your eggs,
Man say: I got to take hold of this here world, Baby! 

---

And a woman will say: Eat your eggs and go to work. Man say – 

---


I got to change my life, I'm choking to death, Baby! And his woman say – 

---


Your eggs is getting cold!


---

## RUTH:
Walter, that ain't none of our money.



---

## WALTER:
This morning, I was lookin' in the mirror and thinking about it - 

---

I'm thirty-five years old; I been married eleven years and I got a boy who sleeps in the living room - 

---

and all I got to give him is nothing. Nothing but stories about how rich white people live -


---

## RUTH:
Eat your eggs, Walter.


---

## WALTER:
DAMN MY EGGS - DAMN ALL THE EGGS THAT EVER WAS!


---

## RUTH:
Then go to work.


---

## WALTER:
See - I'm trying to talk to you 'bout me – 

---


-and all you can say is eat them eggs and go to work.


---

## RUTH:
Honey, you never say nothing new. I listen to you every day - every night and every morning and you never say nothing new. 

---


So, you would rather be Mr. Arnold than be his chauffeur. So - I would rather be living in Buckingham Palace.


---

## WALTER:
That is just what is wrong with the colored woman in this world - don't understand about building their men up and making 'em feel like they somebody. Like they can do something.


---

## RUTH:
There are colored men who do things.


---

## WALTER:
No thanks to the colored woman.


---

## RUTH:
Well, being a colored woman I guess I can't help myself none!


---

## WALTER:
We one group of men tied to a race of women with small minds.


---

## BENEATHA:
I am going to start timing those people. 


---

## WALTER:
You should get up earlier.


---

## BENEATHA:
Really - would you suggest dawn? Where's the paper?


---

## WALTER:
You are one horrible-looking chick at this hour.


---

## BENEATHA:
Good morning, everybody!


---

## WALTER:
How is school coming?


---

## BENEATHA:
Lovely. Lovely. And you know, Biology is the greatest. Yesterday I dissected something that looked just like you!


---

## WALTER:
I just wondered if you've made up your mind and everything.


---

## BENEATHA:
And what did I answer yesterday morning - and the day before that -?


---

## RUTH:
Don't be so nasty, Bennie.


---

## BENEATHA:
And the day before that and the day before that!


---

## WALTER:
I'm interested in you. Something wrong with that? Ain't many girls who decide -

---


## WALTER and BENEATHA:
-"to be a doctor."


---

## WALTER:
Have we figured out yet just exactly how much medical school is going to cost?


---

## RUTH:
Walter Lee, why don't you leave that girl alone and get out of here to work?


---

## BENEATHA:
COME ON OUT OF THERE, PLEASE! 


---

## WALTER:
You know the check is coming tomorrow.


---

## BENEATHA:
That money belongs to Mama, Walter, and it's for her to decide how to use it. I don't care if she wants to buy a house or a rocket ship or just nail it up and look at it - it's hers. Not ours - hers.



---

## WALTER:
Now ain't that fine! You just got your mother's interests at heart, ain't you, girl? You such a nice girl - but Mama can always take a few thousand and help you through school - can't she?


---

## BENEATHA:
I have never asked anyone around here to do anything for me.


---

## WALTER:
No! But the line between asking and just accepting when the time comes is big and wide - ain't it!


---

## BENEATHA:
What do you want from me, Brother - that I quit school or just drop dead, which!


---

## WALTER:
I don't want nothing but for you to stop acting holy around here - me and Ruth done made some sacrifices for you - why can't you do something for the family?


---

## RUTH:
Walter don't be dragging me in it.


---

## WALTER:
You are in it - Don't you get up and go work in somebody's kitchen to help put clothes on her back -?


---

## RUTH:
Oh, Walter - that's not fair -


---

## WALTER:
It ain't that nobody expects you to get on your knees and say thank you, Brother! 

---


Thank you, Ruth; thank you, Mama - and thank you, Travis, for wearing the same pair of shoes for two semesters -


---

## BENEATHA:
Well I do – alrights - THANK EVERYBODY! 

---


AND FORGIVE ME FOR EVER WANTING TO BE ANYTHING AT ALL!

---


FORGIVE ME, FORGIVE ME, FORGIVE ME!


---

## RUTH:
Please stop it! Your Mama'll hear you.


---

## WALTER:
Who the hell told you you had to be a doctor? If you so crazy 'bout messing round with sick people - then go be a nurse like other women - or just get married and shut up! 


---

## BENEATHA:
Well - you finally got it said - It took you three years, but you finally got it said. Walter, give up; leave me alone - it's Mama's money.


---

## WALTER:
He was my father, too!


---

## BENEATHA:
So what? He was mine, too - and Travis' grandfather - But the insurance money belongs to Mama. 

---

Picking on me is not going to make her give it to you to invest in any liquor stores – 
And I for one say, God bless Mama for that!


---

## WALTER:
See - did you hear? - Did you hear!


---

## RUTH:
Honey, please go to work.


---

## WALTER:
Nobody in this house is ever going to understand me.


---

## BENEATHA:
Because you're a nut.


---

## WALTER:
Who's a nut?


---

## BENEATHA:
You - you are a nut. Thee is mad, boy.


---

## WALTER:
The world's most backward race of people and that's a fact. 


---

## BENEATHA:
And then there are all those prophets who would lead us out of the wilderness – 
Into the swamps! 


---

## RUTH:
Bennie, why you always gotta be pickin' on your brother? Can't you be a little sweeter sometimes?


---

## WALTER:
I- uh­ 
I need some money- 
-for carfare.


---

## RUTH:
Fifty cents? 
Here. 
Take a taxi!


---

## MAMA:
Who that round here slamming doors at this hour? 


---

## RUTH:
That was Walter Lee. He and Bennie was at it again. 


---

## MAMA:
My children and they tempers. Lord, if this little old plant don't get more sun than it's been getting it ain't never going to see Spring again. 

---

What's the matter with you this morning, Ruth, you looks right peaked. You aiming to iron all them things - 

---

leave some for me. Bennie honey, it's too drafty for you to be sitting round half dressed. Where's your robe?


---

## BENEATHA:
In the cleaners.


---

## MAMA:
Well, go get mine.


---

## BENEATHA:
I'm not cold, Mama, honest. 


---

## MAMA:
I know - but you so thin – 


---

## BENEATHA:
Mama, I'm not cold.


---

## MAMA:
Lord have mercy, look at that poor bed. Bless his heart - he tries, don't he?


---

## RUTH:
No - he don't half try at all 'cause he knows you going to come along behind him and fix everything. That's just how come he don't know how to do nothing right now -you done spoiled that boy so.


---

## MAMA:
Well - he's a little boy. Ain't supposed to know 'bout housekeeping. 
 

---


My baby, that's what he is. What you fix for his breakfast?


---

## RUTH:
I feed my son, Lena!


---

## MAMA:
I ain't meddling. 
I just noticed all last week he had cold cereal. When it starts getting this chilly a child ought to have some hot grits or something when he goes out -


---

## RUTH:
I gave him hot oats - is that alright?


---

## MAMA:
I ain't meddling. 
Put a lot of nice butter on it? 
He likes lots of butter. 


---

## RUTH:
Lena -


---

## MAMA:
What was you and your brother fussing 'bout -? 


---

## BENEATHA:
It's not important, Mama.


---

## MAMA:
What was they fighting about?


---

## RUTH:
Now you know as well as I do.


---

## MAMA:
Brother still worrying his-self sick about that money?


---

## RUTH:
You know he is. 


---

## MAMA:
You had breakfast? 


---

## RUTH:
Some coffee.


---

## MAMA:
Girl, you better start eating and looking after yourself better. You almost thin as Travis, 


---

## RUTH:
Lena-


---

## MAMA:
Un-hunh?


---

## RUTH:
What are you going to do with it?


---

## MAMA:
Now don't you start, child. It's too early in the morning to be talking about money. Besides, it ain't Christian.


---

## RUTH:
It's just that he got his heart set on that store -


---

## MAMA:
We ain't no business people, Ruth. We just plain working folks.


---

## RUTH:
Ain't nobody business people till they go into business. Walter Lee says colored people ain't never going to start getting ahead till they start gambling on some different kinds of things in the world - investments and things.


---

## MAMA:
What done got into you, girl? Walter Lee done finally sold you on investing?


---

## RUTH:
No. Mama, something is happening between Walter and me. I don't know what it is - but he needs something - something I can't give him any more. He needs this chance, Lena.


---

## MAMA:
But liquor, honey-


---

## RUTH:
Well - like Walter say­ I 'spec' people going to always be drinking themselves some liquor.


---

## MAMA:
Well - whether they drinks it or not ain't none of my business. But whether I sells it to 'em is - and I don't want that 
-on my ledger this late in life,
Ruth Younger, what's the matter with you today? You look like you could fall over right there.


---

## RUTH:
I'm tired.


---

## MAMA:
Then you better stay home from work.


---

## RUTH:
I can't stay home. She be calling up the agency - "My girl didn't come in today - send me somebody! My girl didn't come in!" Oh, she just have a fit –


---

## MAMA:
Well, let her have it. I'll just call her up and say you get the flu -


---

## RUTH:
Why the flu?


---

## MAMA:
'Cause it sounds respectable to 'em. Something white people get, too. They know bout the flu. 
Otherwise, they think you been cut up or something when you tell 'em you sick.


---

## RUTH:
I got to go in. We need the money.


---

## MAMA:
Lord, have mercy! Somebody would of thought my children done all but starved to death the way they talk about money here late. Child, we got a great big old check coming tomorrow.


---

## RUTH:
Now that's your money. It ain't got nothing to do with me. We all feel like that - Walter and Bennie and me - even Travis.


---

## MAMA:
Ten thousand dollars -


---

## RUTH:
Sure is wonderful.


---

## MAMA:
Ten thousand dollars.



---

## RUTH:
You know what you should do, Miss Lena? You should take yourself a trip somewhere. To Europe or South America or someplace -


---

## MAMA:
Oh, child!


---

## RUTH:
I'm serious. Just pack up and leave! Forget about the family and have yourself a ball for once in your life -


---

## MAMA:
You sound like I'm just about ready to die. Who'd go with me? What I look like wandering 'round Europe by myself?


---

## RUTH:
Shoot - these here – rich white women do it all the time. They don't think nothing of packing up they suitcases and piling on one of them big steamships and - swoosh! - they gone, child.


---

## MAMA:
Something always told me I wasn't no rich white woman!


---

## RUTH:
Well - what are you going to do with it, then?


---

## MAMA:
I ain't rightly decided. 
Course, some of it got to be put away for Beneatha's medical schoolin' - ain't nothing going to touch that part. Nothing.
Been thinking that we maybe could meet the notes on a little old two-story somewhere with a yard where Travis could play in the summertime - if we use part of the insurance for a down payment and everybody kind of pitch in. I could maybe take on a little daywork again-


---

## RUTH:
Well, lord knows, we've put enough rent into this here rat trap to pay for four houses by now –


---

## MAMA:
"Rat trap" -
Yes, that's all it is. 
I remember just as well the day me and Big Walter moved in here though. Hadn't been married but two weeks and wasn't planning on living here no more than a year. 

---


We was going to set away, little by little, don't you know, and buy a little place out in Morgan Park. Even picked out the house. 


---


Looks right dumpy today. But lord, child, you should know all the dreams I had 'bout buying that house and fixing it up and making me a little garden in the back – 

---


And didn't none of it happen.


---

## RUTH:
Yes, life can be a barrel of disappointments, sometimes.


---

## MAMA:
Honey, Big Walter would come in here some nights back then and slump down on that couch there and just look at the rug and look at me and look at the rug and then back at me - And I'd know he was down then - really down.

---

And then, lord, when I lost that baby - little Claude - I almost thought I was going to lose Big Walter, too. Oh, that man grieved hisself! He was one man to love his children.


---

## RUTH:
Ain't nothin' can tear at you like losin' your baby.


---

## MAMA:
I guess that's how come that man finally worked hisself to death like he done. Like he was fighting his own war with this here world that took his baby from him.


---

## RUTH:
He sure was a fine man, Mr. Younger. 


---

## MAMA:
Crazy 'bout his children! God knows there was plenty wrong with Walter Younger-hard-headed, mean, kind of wild with the women. 

---


Plenty wrong with him. 

---


But he sure loved his children. Always wanted them to have something - be something. That's where Brother gets all these notions, I reckon. 

---

Big Walter used to say, he'd get right wet in the eyes sometimes, lean his head back with the water standing in his eyes and say,

"Seem like God didn't see fit to give the black man nothing but dreams - 

---

but He did give us children to make them dreams seem worthwhile." 

---


He could talk like that, don't you know.


---

## RUTH:
Yes, he sure could. He was a good man, Mr. Younger.


---

## MAMA:
Yes, a fine man. Just couldn't never catch up with his dreams, that's all.


---

A vacuum whirs.

--- 

## BENEATHA:
What could be so dirty on that woman's rugs that she has to vacuum them every single day?


---

## RUTH:
I wish a certain young woman 'round here who I could name would take inspiration about certain rugs in a certain apartment I could also mention.


---

## BENEATHA:
How much cleaning can a house need, for Christ's sake?


---

## MAMA:
Bennie! 


---

## RUTH:
Just listen to her - just listen!


---

## BENEATHA:
Oh God!


---

## MAMA:
If you use the Lord's name just one more time -


---

## BENEATHA:
Oh, Mama – 


---

## RUTH:
Fresh - just fresh as salt, this girl


---

## BENEATHA:
Well - if the salt loses its savor -


---

## MAMA:
Now that will do. Just ain't going to have you 'round here reciting the scriptures in vain - you hear me?


---

## BENEATHA:
How did I manage to get on everybody's wrong side by just walking into a room?


---

## MAMA:
What time you be home from school? 


---

## BENEATHA:
Kind of late. Madeline is going to start my guitar lessons today. 


---

## MAMA:
Your what kind of lessons?


---

## BENEATHA:
Guitar.


---

## RUTH:
Oh Father!


---

## MAMA:
How come you done taken it in your mind to learn to play the guitar?


---

## BENEATHA:
I just want to, that's all.


---

## MAMA:
Lord, child, don't you know what to do with yourself? How long it going to be before you get tired of this now – 
Like you got tired of that little play-acting group you joined last year? 
And what was it the year before that -?


---

## RUTH:
The horseback riding club for which she bought that fifty-five-dollar riding habit that's been hanging in the closet ever since!


---

## MAMA:
Why you got to flit so from one thing to another, baby?


---

## BENEATHA:
I just want to learn to play the guitar. Is there anything wrong with that?


---

## MAMA:
Ain't nobody trying to stop you.
I just wonders sometimes why you has to flit so from one thing to another. You ain't never done nothing with all that camera equipment you brought home -


---

## BENEATHA:
I don't flit! I - I experiment with different forms of expression -


---

## RUTH:
Like riding a horse?


---

## BENEATHA:
People have to express themselves one way or another.


---

## MAMA:
What is it you want to express? 


---

## BENEATHA:
Me!

---


(MAMA and RUTH laugh.)

---


Don't worry - I don't expect you to understand. 


---

## MAMA:
Who you going out with tomorrow night?


---

## BENEATHA:
George Murchison again.


---

## MAMA:
Oh - you getting a little sweet on him?


---

## RUTH:
You ask me this child ain't sweet on nobody but herself – 

---


Express herself!


---

## BENEATHA:
Oh - I like George alright, MAMA: I mean I like him enough to go out with him and stuff but – 


---

## RUTH:
What does "and stuff' mean?


---

## BENEATHA:
Mind your own business.


---

## MAMA:
Stop picking at her now, Ruth
WHAT DOES IT MEAN -? 


---

## BENEATHA:
Oh, I just mean I couldn't ever really be serious about George. He's - he's so shallow.


---

## RUTH:
Shallow? What do you mean he's shallow? He's RICH!


---

## MAMA:
Hush, Ruth. 


---

## BENEATHA:
I know he's rich. He knows he's rich, too.


---

## RUTH:
Well - what other qualities a man got to have to satisfy you, little girl?


---

## BENEATHA:
You wouldn't even begin to understand. Anybody who married Walter could not possibly understand.


---

## MAMA:
What kind of way is that to talk about your brother?


---

## BENEATHA:
Brother is a flip - let's face it.



---

## MAMA:
What's a flip?


---

## RUTH:
She's saying he's crazy.


---

## BENEATHA:
Not crazy. Brother isn't really crazy yet. He - he's an elaborate neurotic.


---

## MAMA:
Hush your mouth!


---

## BENEATHA:
As for George. Well – George looks good - he's got a beautiful car, and he takes me to nice places, and I even like him sometimes - but if the Youngers are sitting around waiting to see if their little Bennie is going to tie up the family with the Murchisons, they are wasting their time. 


---

## RUTH:
You mean you wouldn't marry George Murchison even if he asked you some day? That pretty, rich thing? Honey, I knew you was odd -


---

## BENEATHA:
No, I would not marry him if all I felt for him was what I feel now. Besides, George's family wouldn't really like it.


---

## MAMA:
Why not?


---

## BENEATHA:
Oh, Mama - The Murchisons are honest-to-­God, real-live-rich colored people, and the only people in the world who are more snobbish than rich white people are rich colored people. I thought everybody knew that. I've met Mrs. Murchison. She's a scene!


---

## MAMA:
You must not dislike people 'cause they well off, honey.


---

## BENEATHA:
Why not? It makes just as much sense as disliking people 'cause they are poor, and lots of people do that.


---

## RUTH:
Well, she'll get over some of this -


---

## BENEATHA:
Get over it? What are you talking about, Ruth? Listen, I'm going to be a doctor. 

---

I'm not worried about who I'm going to marry yet - if I ever get married. 

---


## MAMA and RUTH:
IF!


---

## MAMA:
Now, Bennie -


---

## BENEATHA:
Oh, I probably will - but first I'm going to be a doctor, and George, for one, still thinks that's pretty funny. I couldn't be bothered with that. I am going to be a doctor and everybody around here better understand that!


---

## MAMA:
'Course you going to be a doctor, honey, God willing.


---

## BENEATHA:
God hasn't got a thing to do with it.


---

## MAMA:
Beneatha - that just wasn't necessary.



---

## BENEATHA:
Well - neither is God. I get sick of hearing about God.


---

## MAMA:
Beneatha!


---

## BENEATHA:
I mean it! I'm just tired of hearing about God all the time. What has He got to do with anything -? Does he pay tuition?


---

## MAMA:
You 'bout to get your fresh little jaw slapped!


---

## RUTH:
That's just what she needs!


---

## BENEATHA:
Why? Why can't I say what I want too around here like everybody else?


---

## MAMA:
It don't sound nice for a young girl to say things like that - you wasn't brought up that way. Me and your father went to trouble to get you and Brother to church every Sunday.


---

## BENEATHA:
Mama, you don't understand. It's all a matter of ideas and God is just one idea I don't accept. It's not important. I am not going out and be immoral or commit crimes because I don't believe in God. I don't even think about it.

---

It's just that I get tired of Him getting credit for all the things the human race achieves through its own stubborn effort. There simply is no blasted God - there is only Man – and it is he who makes miracles! 


---

## MAMA:
Now - you say after me, in my mother's house there is still God.
In my mother's house there is still God.


---

## BENEATHA:
In my mother's house there is still God.


---

## MAMA:
There are some ideas we ain't going to have in this house. Not long as I am still head of this family.


---

## BENEATHA:
Yes, ma'am.


---

## RUTH:
Bennie, you think you a woman - but you still a little girl. What you did was childish - so you got treated like a child.


---

## BENEATHA:
I see. I also see that everybody thinks it's alright for Mama to be a tyrant, but all the tyranny in the world will never put a God in the heavens! 


---

## RUTH:
She said she was sorry.


---

## MAMA:
They frightens me, Ruth: My children.


---

## RUTH:
You got good children, Lena. They just a little off sometimes - but they're good.


---

## MAMA:
No - there's something come down between me and them that don't let us understand each other and I don't know what it is. 

---

One done almost lost his mind thinking 'bout money all the time and the other done commence to talk about things I can't seem to understand in no form or fashion. 

---

What is it that's changing, Ruth?


---

## RUTH:
Now - you taking it all too seriously. You just got strong-willed children and it takes a strong woman like you to keep 'em in hand.


---

## MAMA:
They spirited alright, my children. Got to admit they got spirit - Bennie and Walter. 

---

Like this little old plant that ain't never had enough sunshine or nothing - and look at it.


---

## RUTH:
You sure loves that little old thing, don't you-


---

## MAMA:
Well, I always wanted me a garden like folks had down home. This plant is close as I ever got to having one.

---


Lord, ain't nothing as dreary as the view from this window on a dreary day, is there? Why ain't you singing this morning, Ruth? Sing that No Ways Tired. That song always lifts me up so -

---


Ruth! Ruth honey- what's the matter with you - Ruth!

---

 
"Be Blessed" by Yolanda Adams: 
"Too many storms have passed your way
And you're all washed out 'cause it rained on your parade
Seems nobody cares about you anyway
Now you're living your life like a castaway
Search for strength inside, was it all in vain
'Cause the deeper you dig you find more and more pain
Don't let your tomorrow be like yesterday
'Cause I spoke to God, I called out your name
And on your behalf I just asked
If He would be there for you"

---

"Stay in My Corner" by The Dells plays on the record. 

---

## TRAVIS:
Grandmama, that stuff Bennie is using smells awful. Can I go outside, please?


---

## MAMA:
Did you get all them chores done already? I ain't seen you doing much.


---

## TRAVIS:
Yes'm - finished early. Where did Mama go this morning?


---

## MAMA:
She had to go on a little errand.

---

The phone rings. 


---

## TRAVIS:
Where?


---

## MAMA:
To tend to her business.


---

## BENEATHA:
Haylo.
Yes, he is. 
It's Willie Harris again. 


---

## WALTER:
Hello, Willy. You get the papers from the lawyer? - No, not yet. I told you the mailman doesn't get here till ten-thirty- No, I'll come there. - Yeah! Right away.


---

## BENEATHA:
Brother, where did Ruth go?


---

## WALTER:
How should I know!


---

## TRAVIS:
Aw come on, Grandma. Can I go outside?


---

## MAMA:
Oh, I guess so. You stay right in front of the house, though, and keep a good lookout for the postman.


---

## TRAVIS:
Yes'm.
Leave them poor little old cockroaches alone, they ain't bothering you none.


---

## BENEATHA:
I'll cockroach you, boy.


---

## TRAVIS:
Grandma! Grandma!


---

## MAMA:
Look out there, girl, before you be spilling that stuff on that child!


---

## TRAVIS:
That's right - look out, now! 


---

## BENEATHA:
I can't imagine that it would hurt him - it has never hurt the roaches!


---

## MAMA:
Well, little boys' hides ain't as tough as South-side roaches. You better get over there behind the bureau. I seen one marching out of there like Napoleon yesterday.


---

## BENEATHA:
 
There's really only one way to get rid of them, Mama -


---

## MAMA:
How?


---

## BENEATHA:
Set fire to this building! 
Mama, where did Ruth go?


---

## MAMA:
To the doctor, I think.


---

## BENEATHA:
The doctor? - What's the matter?
You don't think -


---

## MAMA:
Now I ain't saying what I think. But I ain't never been wrong 'bout a woman, neither.

---

The phone rings.


---

## BENEATHA:
Hay-lo - Oh! 
Well - when did you get back! - Of course I've missed you - in my way - This morning? No - house-cleaning - Mama hates it if I let people come over when the house is like this -


---

## MAMA:
That's right!


---

## BENEATHA:
You have? - Well, that's different - What is it? - Oh, what the hell, come on over – 
Right, Arrivederci. 


---

## MAMA:
Who is that you inviting over here with this house looking like this? You ain't got the pride you was born with!


---

## BENEATHA:
Asagai doesn't care how houses look, Mama – he's an intellectual.


---

## MAMA:
WHO-?


---

## BENEATHA:
Asagai - Joseph Asagai. He's an African boy I met on campus - He's been studying in Canada.


---

## MAMA:
'What's his name?


---

## BENEATHA:
Asagai, Joseph AH-SAH-GUY – 
He's from Nigeria.


---

## MAMA:
Oh, that's the little country that was founded by slaves way back -


---

## BENEATHA:
No, Mama - that's Liberia, 


---

## MAMA:
I don't think I never met no African before.


---

## BENEATHA:
Well, do me a favor and don't ask him a whole lot of ignorant questions like do they wear clothes -


---

## MAMA:
Well, now, if you think we so ignorant 'round here, maybe you shouldn't bring your friends here -


---

## BENEATHA:
It's just that all anyone seems to know about when it comes to Africa is Tarzan -


---

## MAMA:
Why should I know anything about Africa?


---

## BENEATHA:
Why do you give money at church for the missionary work?


---

## MAMA:
Well, that's to help save people. 


---

## BENEATHA:
You mean save them from heathenism –


---

## MAMA:
Yes.


---

## BENEATHA:
I'm afraid they need more salvation from the British and the French.


---

## RUTH:
Well, I guess from all the happy faces - everybody knows.


---

## BENEATHA:
Ruth. You pregnant!?


---

## MAMA:
Lord have mercy, I sure hope it's a little old girl. Travis ought to have a sister.


---

## BENEATHA:
How far along are you?


---

## RUTH:
Two months.


---

## BENEATHA:
Did you mean to? I mean did you plan it or was it an accident?


---

## MAMA:
What do you know about planning or not planning?


---

## RUTH:
She's twenty years old, Lena.


---

## BENEATHA:
Did you plan it, Ruth?


---

## RUTH:
Mind your own business.


---

## BENEATHA:
It is my business - where is he going to sleep, on the roof?
Gee - I didn't mean that, Ruth, honest. Gee, I don't feel like that at all. I - I think it is wonderful.


---

## RUTH:
Wonderful.


---

## BENEATHA:
Yes - really.

---

## MAMA:
Doctor say everything going to be all right?


---

## RUTH:
Yes - she says everything is going to be fine -


---

## MAMA:
"She?" What doctor you went to?


---

## MAMA:
Ruth honey - what's the matter with you-you sick?


---

## BENEATHA:
What's the matter with her, Mama?


---

## MAMA:
She be alright. Women gets right depressed sometimes when they get her way. 
Now you just relax, that's right - just lean back, don't think 'bout nothing at all - nothing at all -


---

## RUTH:
I'm alright -


---

## MAMA:
Come on now, honey. You need to lie down and rest a while - then have some nice hot food.

---

The doorbell rings.


---

## BENEATHA:
Oh, my God - that must be Asagai.


---

## ASAGAI:
Hello, Alaiyo -


---

## BENEATHA:
Hello -
Well - come in. And please excuse everything. My mother was very upset about the place looking like this.


---

## ASAGAI:
You look disturbed - Is something wrong?


---

## BENEATHA:
Yes - we've all got acute ghetto-i-tus. 
So - sit down. No! Wait!
So, how was Canada?


---

## ASAGAI:
Canadian.


---

## BENEATHA:
Asagai, I'm very glad you are back.


---

## ASAGAI:
Are you really?


---

## BENEATHA:
Yes - very.


---

## ASAGAI:
Why? - You were quite glad when I went away. What happened?


---

## BENEATHA:
You went away.


---

## ASAGAI:
Ahhhhhhhh.


---

## BENEATHA:
Before - you wanted to be so serious before there was time.


---

## ASAGAI:
How much time must there be before one knows what one feels?


---

## BENEATHA:
What did you bring me-?


---

## ASAGAI:
Open it and see.


---

## BENEATHA:
Oh, Asagai! You got them for me! How beautiful! 
And the records, too!


---

## ASAGAI:
Wait! I shall have to teach you how to drape it properly.
Ah - "Opegede! Ogbamushe!"
You wear it well - very well - mutilated hair and all.


---

## BENEATHA:
My hair - what's wrong with my hair?


---

## ASAGAI:
Were you born with it like that?


---

## BENEATHA:
No - of course not.


---

## ASAGAI:
How then?


---

## BENEATHA:
You know perfectly well how - as - as nap - crinkly as yours - that's how.


---

## ASAGAI:
And it is ugly to you that way?


---

## BENEATHA:
Oh, no - not ugly -
But it's so hard to manage when it's, well – raw.


---

## ASAGAI:
And so, to accommodate that - you mutilate it every week?


---

## BENEATHA:
It's not mutilation!


---

## ASAGAI:
Oh - please! I am only teasing you because you are so very serious about these things.
Do you remember the first time we met at school?
You came up to me and you said - and I thought you were the most serious little thing I had ever seen - you said –  
"Mr. Asagai - I want very much to talk with you. About Africa. You see, Mr. Asagai, I am looking for my identity!"


---

## BENEATHA:
Yes -


---

## ASAGAI:
Well - it is true that this is not so much a profile of a Hollywood queen as perhaps a Queen of the Nile – 
But what does it matter? Assimilationism is so popular in your country.


---

## BENEATHA:
I am not an assimilationist!


---

## ASAGAI:
Such a serious one. 
So - you like the robes? You must take excellent care of them - they are from my sister's personal wardrobe.


---

## BENEATHA:
You - you sent all the way home – for me?


---

## ASAGAI:
For you - I would do much more. Well, that is what I came for. I must go.

---

## BENEATHA:
Will you call me Monday?


---

## ASAGAI:
Yes - we have a great deal to talk about, you and I. I mean about identity and time and all that.


---

## BENEATHA:
Time?


---

## ASAGAI:
Yes - about how much time one needs to know what one feels.


---

## BENEATHA:
You see! You never understood that there is more than one kind of feeling which can exist between a man and a woman - or at least - there should be.


---

## ASAGAI:
No - between a man and a woman there need be only one kind of feeling. I have that for you - now even - right this moment -


---

## BENEATHA:
I know - and by itself - it won't do. I can find that anywhere.


---

## ASAGAI:
For a woman it should be enough.


---

## BENEATHA:
I know - because that's what it says in all the novels that men write. But it isn't. Go ahead and laugh - but I'm not interested in being someone's little episode in America or –  one of them!


---

## ASAGAI:
It's just that every American girl I have known has said that to me. White - black - in this you are all the same. And the same speech, too!


---

## ASAGAI:
It's how you can be sure that the world's most liberated women are not liberated at all. You all talk about it too much!


---

## BENEATHA:
Oh - Mama - this is Mr. Asagai.


---

## MAMA:
How do you do?


---

## ASAGAI:
How do you do, Mrs. Younger? Please forgive me for coming at such an outrageous hour on a Saturday.


---

## MAMA:
Well, you are quite welcome. I just hope you understand that our house – don't always look like this. 

---

You must come again. I would love to hear all about – your country. I think it's so sad the way our American Negroes don't know nothing about Africa 'cept Tarzan and all that. And all that money they pour into these churches when they ought to be helping you people over there drive out them French and Englishmen done taken away your land.


---

## ASAGAI:
Yes - yes -


---

## MAMA:
How many miles is it from here to where you come from?


---

## ASAGAI:
Many thousands.


---

## MAMA:
I bet you don't half look after yourself, being away from your mama so far. I 'spec' you better come 'round here from time to time and get yourself some home-cooked meals -


---

## ASAGAI:
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Well - I must go. I will call you Monday, Alaiyo.


---

## MAMA:
What's that he call you?


---

## ASAGAI:
Oh - "Alaiyo" - I hope you don't mind. It is what you call a "nickname," I think. It is a Yoruba word. I am a Yoruba.


---

## MAMA:
I - I thought you said he was from – 


---

## ASAGAI:
Nigeria is my country. Yoruba is my tribal origin -


---

## BENEATHA:
You didn't tell us what Alaiyo means - for all I know, you might be calling me Little Idiot or something -


---

## ASAGAI:
Well - let me see - I do not know just how to explain it. The sense of a thing can be so different when it changes languages...


---

## BENEATHA:
You're evading.


---

## ASAGAI:
No - really it is difficult – 
It means - it means One for Whom Bread - Food - is Not Enough. 
Is that alright?


---

## BENEATHA:
Thank you.


---

## MAMA:
Well - that's nice - You must come see us again - Mr. – 


---

## ASAGAI:
AH-SA-GAI.


---

## MAMA:
Yes - Do come again.


---

## ASAGAI:
Good-bye. 


---

## MAMA:
Lord, that's a pretty thing just went out of here! Yes, I guess I see why we done commence to get so interested in Africa 'round here. Missionaries my Aunt Jenny!


---

## BENEATHA:
Oh, Mama-!


---

## TRAVIS:
What's the matter, girl, you cracking up? 


---

## MAMA:
She's resting now. Travis, baby, run next door and ask Miss Johnson to please let me have a little kitchen cleanser. This here can is empty as Jacob's kettle.


---

## TRAVIS:
I just came in.


---

## MAMA:
Do as you told.
Where you going?


---

## BENEATHA:
To become a queen of the Nile!


---

## RUTH:
Where did Bennie go?


---

## MAMA:
Far as I could make out - to Egypt. Who told you to get up?


---

## RUTH:
Ain't nothing wrong with me to be lying in no bed for.


---

## MAMA:
What time is it getting to?


---

## RUTH:
Ten-twenty. And the mailman going to ring that bell this morning just like he done every morning for the last umpteen years.


---

## TRAVIS:
She say to tell you that she don't have much.


---

## MAMA:
Lord, some people I could name sure is tight-fisted! 
Mark two cans of cleanser down on the list there. If she that hard up for kitchen cleanser, I sure don't want to forget to get her none!


---

## RUTH:
Lena - maybe the woman is just short on cleanser -


---

## MAMA:
Much baking powder as she done borrowed from me all these years, she could of done gone into the baking business!

---

The door bell rings.

---

## RUTH:
GET DOWN THEM STEPS, BOY!


---

## MAMA:
You mean it done really come?


---

## RUTH:
Oh, Miss Lena!


---

## MAMA:
Well - I don't know what we all so excited about 'round here for. We known it was coming for months. 
That's a whole lot different from having it come and being able to hold it in your hands - a piece of paper worth ten thousand dollars - 

---

Come on! Open it - Lord have mercy, I wish Walter Lee was here!


---

## TRAVIS:
Open it, Grandmama!


---

## MAMA:
Now you all be quiet. It's just a check.


---

## RUTH:
Open it -


---

## MAMA:
Now, don't act silly- We ain't never been no people to act silly 'bout no money-


---

## RUTH:
We ain't never had none before - OPEN IT!


---

## MAMA:
Travis! Is them the right amount of zeros?

---


## TRAVIS:
Yes'm - ten thousand dollars. Gaa-lee, Grandmama, you rich.


---

## MAMA:
Ten thousand dollars. 
Put it away somewhere, Ruth. 

---


Ten thousand dollars they give you. Ten thousand dollars.


---

## TRAVIS:
What's the matter with grandmama - don't she want to be rich?


---

## RUTH:
You go on out and play now, baby. 
You've gone and got yourself upset.


---

## MAMA:
I 'spec' if it wasn't for you all - I would just put that money away or give it to the church or something.


---

## RUTH:
Now what kind of talk is that? Mr. Younger would just be plain mad if he could hear you talking foolish like that.


---

## MAMA:
Yes - he sure would, 
We got enough to do with that money alright.


---

## MAMA:
Where did you go today, girl?


---

## RUTH:
To the doctor.


---

## MAMA:
Now, Ruth – you know better than that. Old Doctor Jones is strange enough in his way but there ain't nothing 'bout him make somebody slip and call him "she" like you done this morning. 


---

## RUTH:
Well, that's what happened - my tongue slipped.


---

## MAMA:
You went to see that woman, didn't you?


---

## RUTH:
What woman you talking about?


---

## MAMA:
That woman who -


---

## WALTER:
Mailman come! 
Did it come?

---


Mama - look, old Willy Harris put everything on paper -


---

## MAMA:
Son - I think you ought to talk to your wife - I'll go on out and leave you alone – 


---

## WALTER:
I can talk to her later. Mama, look - Please!


---

## MAMA:
Son-


---

## WALTER:
WILL SOMEBODY PLEASE LISTEN TO ME TODAY!


---

## MAMA:
I don't 'low no yellin' in this house, Walter Lee, and you know it -

---


And there ain't going to be no investing in no liquor stores.


---

## WALTER:
But, Mama, you ain't even looked at it.


---

## MAMA:
I don't aim to have to speak on that again.


---

## WALTER:
You ain't looked at it and you don't aim to have to speak on that again? You ain't even looked at it and you decided – 

---


Well, you tell that to my boy tonight when you put him to sleep on the living room couch!


---

## RUTH:
Where are you going?


---

## WALTER:
Out!


---

## RUTH:
Where?


---

## WALTER:
Just out of this house somewhere – 


---

## RUTH:
I'll come, too. 


---

## WALTER:
I don't want you to come!


---

## RUTH:
I got something to talk to you about, Walter.


---

## WALTER:
That's too bad. 


---

## MAMA:
Walter Lee -
Sit down!


---

## WALTER:
I'm a grown man, Mama.


---

## MAMA:
Ain't nobody said you wasn't grown. But you still in my house and my presence. And as long as you are - you'll talk to your wife civil. 

---


Now sit down.


---

## RUTH:
Oh, let him go on out and drink himself to death! He makes me sick to my stomach!


---

## WALTER:
And you turn mine too, baby-!
That was my biggest mistake -!


---

## MAMA:
Walter, what is the matter with you?


---

## WALTER:
Matter with me? Ain't nothing the matter with me!


---

## MAMA:
Yes, there is. Something eating you up like a crazy man.

---


Something more than me not giving you this money. 

---

The past few years I been watching it happen to you. You get all nervous acting and kind of wild in the eyes -

---


I said sit there now, I'm talking to you!


---

## WALTER:
Mama - I don't need no nagging at me today.


---

## MAMA:
Seem like you getting to a place where you always tied up in some kind of knot about something. 

---

But if anybody ask you 'bout it you just yell at 'em and bust out the house and go out and drink somewheres. Walter Lee, people can't live with that. 

---

Ruth's a good, patient girl in her way - but you getting to be too much. 

---

Boy, don't make the mistake of driving that girl away from you.


---

## WALTER:
Why - what she ever do for me?


---

## MAMA:
She loves you.


---

## WALTER:
Mama - I'm going out. I want to be by myself for a while. 


---

## MAMA:
I'm sorry 'bout your liquor store, son. It just wasn't the thing for us to do. That's what I want to tell you about – 


---

## WALTER:
I got to go out, Mama – 


---

## MAMA:
It's dangerous, son.


---

## WALTER:
What's dangerous?


---

## MAMA:
When a man goes outside his home to look for peace.


---

## WALTER:
Then why can't there never be no peace in this house, then?


---

## MAMA:
You done found it in some other house?


---

## WALTER:
No - there ain't no woman! Why do women always think there's a woman somewhere when a man gets restless? 
Do you know what this money means to me? Do you know what this money can do for us? Mama - Mama - I want so many things -


---

## MAMA:
Yes, son -


---

## WALTER:
I want so many things that they are driving me kind of crazy. Mama - look at me.


---

## MAMA:
I'm looking at you. You are a good-looking boy. You got a job, a nice wife, a fine boy and -



---

## WALTER:
A job. 
Mama, a job? I open and close car doors all day long. 

---

I drive a man around in his limousine and say, "Yes, sir," "No, sir," "Very good, sir," "Shall I take the drive, sir?" 

---

Mama, that ain't no kind of job - that ain't nothin' at all. 

---


Mama, I don't know if I can make you understand. 


---

## MAMA:
Understand what, baby?


---

## WALTER:
Sometimes it's like I can see the future stretched out in front of me - just plain as day. 

---

The future, Mama. Hanging over there at the edge of my days. 

---

Just waiting for me - a big, looming blank space - full of nothing. Just waiting for me. 

---

But it don't have to be.

---


Mama - sometimes when I'm downtown driving that man around and I pass them cool, quiet-looking restaurants where them white boys are sitting back and talking 'bout things - 

---

sitting there turning deals worth millions of dollars - 

---

sometimes I see guys don't look much older than me -


---

## MAMA:
Son - how come you talk so much 'bout money? 


---

## WALTER:
Because it is life, Mama! 


---

## MAMA:
Oh – So now money is life. Once upon a time freedom used to be life - now it's money.


---

## WALTER:
No - it was always money, Mama. We just didn't know about it.


---

## MAMA:
No - something has changed. 

---

You something new, boy. In my time we was worried about not being lynched and getting to the North if we could and how to stay alive and still have a pinch of dignity too. 

---

Now here come you and Beneatha - talking about things we ain't never even thought about hardly, me and your daddy. 

---

You ain't satisfied or proud of nothing we done. I mean that you had a home; that we kept you out of trouble till you was grown; 

---

that you don't have to ride to work on the back of nobody's streetcar -

---

You my children - but how different we done become.


---

## WALTER:
You don't understand, Mama, you just don't understand.


---

## MAMA:
Son - do you know your wife is expecting another baby?

---


That's what she wanted to talk to you about. 

---

This isn't for me to be telling- but you ought to know. 

---


I think Ruth is thinking 'bout getting rid of that child.


---

## WALTER:
No - no - Ruth wouldn't do that.


---

## MAMA:
When the world gets ugly enough - a woman will do anything for her family. The part that's already living.


---

## WALTER:
You don't know Ruth, Mama, if you think she would do that.


---

## RUTH:
Yes, I would, too, Walter. 
I gave her a five dollar down payment.


---

## MAMA:
Well­.
Well - son, I'm waiting to hear you say something -

---

I'm waiting to hear how you be your father's son. Be the man he was –

---

Your wife say she going to destroy your child. And I'm waiting to hear you talk like him and say we a people who give children life, not who destroys them - 

---

I'm waiting to see you stand up and look like your daddy and say we done give up one baby to poverty and that we ain't going to give up nary another one - I'm waiting.


---

If you a son of mine, tell her!

---


You - you are a disgrace to your father's memory.
Somebody get me my hat!

---

Hit the Ground by Lizz Wright plays:



The record player plays "Stay in my Corner" by The Dells
"Hit the ground, babe
It´s alright now
Hit the ground babe
Take your veil down
See your eyes in mine
Leave the rest behind
Hit the ground babe,
´Cause I want to love you now
Hit the ground, babe
I said is alright now"

---

## RUTH:
What have we got on tonight!


---

## BENEATHA:
You are looking at what a well-dressed Nigerian woman wears -

---


Isn't it beautiful?
Enough of this assimilationist junk!

---

The record player stops. Shango style drumming plays.

---

## BENEATHA
OCOMOGOSIAY!


---

## RUTH:
What kind of dance is that?


---

## BENEATHA:
A folk dance.


---

## RUTH:
What kind of folks do that, honey?


---

## BENEATHA:
It's from Nigeria. It's a dance of welcome.


---

## RUTH:
Who you welcoming?


---

## BENEATHA:
The men back to the village.


---

## RUTH:
Where they been?


---

## BENEATHA:
How should I know - out hunting or something, 
Anyway, they are coming back now -


---

## RUTH:
Well, that's good. 


---

## BENEATHA:
Alundi, alundi'
Alundi, alunya
Jopp u a jeepua
Ang gu sooooooooo
Ai yai yae-
Ayehayae - alundi


---

## WALTER:
YEAH - AND ETHIOPIA STRETCH FORTH HER ARMS AGAIN!


---

## RUTH:
Yes - and Africa sure is claiming her own tonight.


---

## WALTER:
Shut up! - I'm digging them drums - them drums move me!
In my heart of hearts – 
I am much warrior!


---

## RUTH:
In your heart of hearts you are much drunkard.


---

## WALTER:
Me and Jomo -
That's my man, Kenyatta.
FLAMING SPEAR! HOT DAMN!
OCOMOGOSIAY!


---

## BENEATHA:
OCOMOGOSIAY, FLAMING SPEAR! 


---

## WALTER:
THE LION IS WAKING - OWIMOWEH!


---

## BENEATHA:
OWIMOWEH!


---

## WALTER:
LISTEN, MY BLACK BROTHERS -


---

## BENEATHA:
We hear you!


---

## WALTER:
Do you hear the waters rushing against the shores of our coastlands -?


---

## BENEATHA:
OCOMOGOSIAY!


---

## WALTER:
Do you hear the screeching of the cocks in yonder hills beyond where the chiefs meet in council for the coming of the mighty war - ?


---

## BENEATHA:
OCOMOGOSIAY!


---

## WALTER:
Do you hear the beating of the wings of the birds flying low over the mountains and the low places of our land-?


---

## BENEATHA:
OCOMOGOSIAY!


---

## WALTER:
Do you hear the singing of the women, singing the war songs of our fathers to the babies in the great houses - Singing the sweet war songs - 

---

OH, DO YOU HEAR, MY BLACKBROTHERS!

---


The doorbell rings.


---

## BENEATHA:
We hear you, Flaming Spear­


---

## WALTER:
Telling us to prepare for the GREATNESS OF THE TIME!

---

Music stops. Ruth buzzes George in.

---

## WALTER
BLACK BROTHER-!


---

## GEORGE:
Black Brother, hell!


---

## RUTH:
Beneatha, you got company - what's the matter with you? Walter Lee Younger, get down off that table and stop acting like a fool -

---


He's had a little to drink - I don't know what her excuse is.


---

## GEORGE:
Look, honey, we're going to the theatre - we're not going to be in it - so go change, huh? 
What in the name of -


---

## RUTH:
Girl - you done lost your natural mind?! Look at your head!


---

## GEORGE:
What have you done to your head - I mean your hair!


---

## BENEATHA:
Nothing - except cut it off.


---

## RUTH:
Now that's the truth - it's what ain't been done to it! You expect this boy to go out with you with your head all nappy like that?


---

## BENEATHA:
That's up to George. If he's ashamed of his heritage -


---

## GEORGE:
Oh, don't be so proud of yourself, Bennie – just 'cause you look eccentric.


---

## BENEATHA:
How can something that's natural be eccentric?


---

## GEORGE:
That's what being eccentric means – being natural. Get dressed.


---

## BENEATHA:
I don't like that, George.


---

## RUTH:
Why must you and your brother make an argument out of everything people say?


---

## BENEATHA:
Because I hate assimilationist Negroes!


---

## RUTH:
Will somebody please tell me what assimila-whoever means!


---

## GEORGE:
Oh, it's just a college girl's way of calling people Uncle Toms - but that isn't what it means at all.


---

## RUTH:
Well, what does it mean?


---

## BENEATHA:
It means someone who is willing to give up - his own culture - and submerge himself completely in the dominant and - in this case - oppressive culture!



---

## GEORGE:
Oh dear, dear, dear! Here we go! A lecture on the African past! 

---

On our Great West African Heritage! In one second, we will hear all about the great Ashanti empires; the great Songhay civilizations and the great sculpture of Benin - and then some poetry in the Bantu – 


---


- and the whole monologue will end with the word heritage! Let's face it, baby, your heritage is nothing but a bunch of raggedy assed spirituals and - some grass huts!


---

## BENEATHA:
GRASS HUTS!


---

See there - you are standing there in your splendid ignorance talking about people who were the first to smelt iron on the face of the earth!

---


The Ashanti were performing surgical operations when the English were still tattooing themselves with blue dragons!


---

## RUTH:
Have a seat, George.

---


Warm, ain't it? I mean for September.
Just like they always say about Chicago weather. If it's too hot or cold - just wait a minute and it'll change.

---


Everybody says it's got to do with them bombs and things they keep setting off. 

---


Would you like a nice cold beer? 


---

## GEORGE:
No, thank you. I don't care for beer. 
I hope she hurries up. 


---

## RUTH:
What time is the show?


---

## GEORGE:
It's an eight-thirty curtain. That's just Chicago, though. In New York standard curtain time is eight­-forty.


---

## RUTH:
You get to New York a lot?


---

## GEORGE:
Few times a year.


---

## RUTH:
Oh that's nice. I've never been to New York.


---

## WALTER:
New York ain't got nothing Chicago ain't, except a bunch of hustling people all squeezed up together - being "Eastern!"


---

## GEORGE:
Oh - you've been?


---

## WALTER:
Plenty of times.


---

## RUTH:
Walter Lee Younger!


---

## WALTER:
Plenty!

---


What we got to drink in this house? Why don't you offer this man some refreshment?

---


They don't know how to entertain in this house, man.


---

## GEORGE:
Thank you - I don't care for anything.


---

## WALTER:
Where's Mama?


---

## RUTH:
She ain't come back yet.


---

## WALTER:
Why all you college boys wear them faggoty ­looking white shoes? 


---

## RUTH:
Walter Lee!


---

## WALTER:
White shoes, cold as it is.


---

## RUTH:
You have to excuse him -


---

## WALTER:
No, he don't! What you always excusing me for! I'll excuse myself when I needs to be excused! 

---


They look funny as hell - bad as them black knee socks Beneatha wears out of here all the time!


---

## RUTH:
It's the college style.


---

## WALTER:
Style, hell, she looks like she got burnt legs or something!


---

## RUTH:
Oh, Walter -


---

## WALTER:
How's your old man making out? I understand you all going to buy that big hotel on the Drive?
Shrewd move. 

---

Your old man is alright, man. 

---


I mean he knows how to operate. I mean he thinks big, you know what I mean. But I think he's kind of running out of ideas now. I'd like to talk to him.

---

Listen, man, I got some plans that could tum this city upside down. 

---

I mean, I think like he does. Big. Invest big, gamble big, hell, lose big if you have to, you know what I mean.

---

It's hard to find a man on this whole Southside who understands my kind of thinking - you dig?

---


Me and you ought to sit down and talk sometimes, man - Man, I got me some ideas -


---

## GEORGE:
Yeah - sometimes we'll have to do that, Walter.


---

## WALTER:
Yeah - well, when you get the time, man. I know you a busy little boy.


---

## RUTH:
Walter, please -


---

## WALTER:
I know ain't nothing in this world as busy as you colored college boys with your fraternity pins and white shoes -


---

## RUTH:
Oh, Walter Lee -


---

## WALTER:
I see y'all all the time - with the books tucked under your arms - going to your "classes" – 

---


And for what! What the hell you learning over there? 

---

Filling up your heads  
with the sociology and the psychology- 

---


But they teaching you how to be a man? 

---

How to take over and run the world? They teaching you how to run a rubber plantation or a steel mill? 

---

Naw - just to talk proper and read books and wear them faggoty-Iooking white shoes.


---

## GEORGE:
You're all wacked up with bitterness, man.


---

## WALTER:
And you - ain't you bitter, man? 

---

Ain't you just about had it yet? Don't you see no stars gleaming that you can't reach out and grab? You happy? - you contented son of a bitch -

---

You happy? You got it made? Bitter? Man, I'm a volcano. 

---

Bitter? Here I am a giant - surrounded by ants! Ants who can't even understand what the giant is talking about.


---

## RUTH:
Oh, Walter -Ain't you with nobody!


---

## WALTER:
No! 'Cause ain't nobody with me! Not even my own mother!


---

## RUTH:
Walter, that's a terrible thing to say!


---

## GEORGE:
Well - hey – 
You look great!


---

## WALTER:
What's the matter with your head?


---

## BENEATHA:
I cut it off, Brother.


---

## WALTER:
Well, I'll be damned. So that's what they mean by the African BUSH!...


---

## BENEATHA:
Ha-ha. Let's go, George.



---

## GEORGE:
You know something. I like it. It's sharp. I mean it really is. 


---

## RUTH:
Yes - I think so, too. 


---

## WALTER:
Oh no! You leave yours alone, baby. You might turn out to have a pin-shaped head or something!


---

## BENEATHA:
See you all later. 


---

## RUTH:
Have a nice time.


---

## GEORGE:
Thanks. Good night. 
Good night, Prometheus.


---

## WALTER:
Who is Prometheus -? 


---

## RUTH:
I don't know, honey. Don't worry about it.


---

## WALTER:
See there - they get to a point where they can't insult you man to man - they got to go talk about something ain't nobody never heard of!


---

## RUTH:
How do you know it was an insult? 
Maybe Prometheus is a nice fellow.


---

## WALTER:
Prometheus! - I bet there ain't even no such thing! I bet that simple-minded clown -


---

## RUTH:
Walter – 


---

## WALTER:
Don't start! 


---

## RUTH:
Start what?


---

## WALTER:
Your nagging! Where was I? Who was I with - How much money did I spend?


---

## RUTH:
Walter Lee -why don't we just try to talk about it-


---

## WALTER:
I been out talking with people who understand me. People who care about the things I got on my mind.


---

## RUTH:
I guess that means people like Willy Harris.


---

## WALTER:
Yes, people like Willy Harris.


---

## RUTH:
Why don't y'all just hurry up and go into the banking business and stop talking about it!


---

## WALTER:
Why? - You want to know why? 'Cause we all tied up in a race of people that don't know how to do nothing but moan, pray and have babies!


---

## RUTH:
Oh, Walter – 
Honey, why can't you stop fighting me?


---

## WALTER:
Who's fighting you? Who even cares about you -!


---

## RUTH:
Well-
I guess I might as well go on to bed – 
I don't know where we lost it - but we have – 
I - I'm sorry about this new baby, Walter - I guess maybe I better go on and do what I started - I guess I just didn't realize how bad things was with us –
I guess just didn't realize -
You want some hot milk?


---

## WALTER:
Hot milk?


---

## RUTH:
Yes - hot milk.


---

## WALTER:
Why hot milk?


---

## RUTH:
'Cause after all that liquor you ought to have something hot in your stomach.


---

## WALTER:
I don't want no milk.


---

## RUTH:
You want some coffee then?


---

## WALTER:
No, I don't want no coffee. I don't want nothing hot to drink. 

---


Why you always trying to give me something to eat!?


---

## RUTH:
What else can I give you, Walter Lee Younger?


---

## WALTER:
Baby, it's been rough, ain't it?

---


I guess between two people there ain't never as much understanding as folks generally thinks there is.

---


I mean like between me and you -

---


How we gets to the place where we scared to talk softness to each other.
Why you think it got to be like that? 

---


Ruth, what is it gets into people ought to be close?


---

## RUTH:
I don't know, honey. I think about it a lot.


---

## WALTER:
On account of you and me, you mean. The way something's come down between us.


---

## RUTH:
There ain't so much between us, Walter - Not when you come to me and try to talk to me. Try to be with me - a little, even.


---

## WALTER:
Sometimes - sometimes - I don't even know how to try.


---

## RUTH:
Walter -


---

## WALTER:
Yes -?


---

## RUTH:
Honey - life don't have to be like this. I mean sometimes people can do things so that things are better-

---


You remember how we used to talk when Travis was born - About the way we were going to live - the kind of house... 

---


Well, it's all starting to slip away from us...


---

## WALTER:
Mama, where have you been?


---

## MAMA:
My - them steps is getting longer and longer. Whew! 

---


How you feeling this evening, Ruth?


---

## WALTER:
Mama, where have you been all day?


---

## MAMA:
Where's Travis?


---

## RUTH:
I let him go out and he ain't come back yet. Boy, is he going to get it!


---

## WALTER:
Mama -!


---

## MAMA:
Yes son?


---

## WALTER:
Where did you go this afternoon?


---

## MAMA:
I went downtown to tend to some business that I had to tend to.


---

## WALTER:
What kind of business?


---

## MAMA:
You know better than to question me like a child, Brother.


---

## WALTER:
Where were you, Mama! 
Mama, you didn't go do something with that money, something crazy!


---

## TRAVIS:
Mama, I -


---

## RUTH:
"Mama, I," nothing! 
You're going to get it, boy! Get on in that bedroom and get yourself ready!


---

## TRAVIS:
But I -


---

## MAMA:
Why don't you never let the child explain his-self?


---

## RUTH:
Keep out of it now, Lena!
A thousand times I have told you not to go off like that-


---

## MAMA:
Well - at least let me tell him something. I want him to be the first one to hear - Come here, baby.
Travis-

---


You know that money we got in the mail this morning?


---

## TRAVIS:
Yes'm -


---

## MAMA:
Well - what do you think your grandmama gone and done with that money?


---

## TRAVIS:
I don't know, Grandmama.


---

## MAMA:
She went and she bought you a house!
You glad about the house? It's going to be yours when you get to be a man.


---

## TRAVIS:
Yes'm. I always wanted to live in a house.


---

## MAMA:
Alright, gimme some sugar, then -

---

Now when you say your prayers tonight, you thank God and your grandfather - 'cause it was him who give you the house - in his way.


---

## RUTH:
Now you get out of here and get ready for your beating.


---

## TRAVIS:
Aw, Mama - Aw - gee -

---

## RUTH:
Get on in there – 
So, you went and did it! 


---

## MAMA:
Yes, I did.


---

## RUTH:
PRAISE GOD!
Please, honey - let me be glad - you be glad, too. Oh, Walter - a home - a home.

---


Well - where is it? How big is it? How much it going to cost-?


---

## MAMA:
Well-


---

## RUTH:
When we moving?


---

## MAMA:
First of the month.


---

## RUTH:
PRAISE GOD!


---

## MAMA:
It's - it's a nice house, too -

---


Three bedrooms - nice big one for you and Ruth - Me and Beneatha still have to share our room, but Travis have one of his own - and – 

---


I figures if the - new baby - is a boy we could get one of them double-decker outfits - And there's a yard with a little patch of dirt where I could maybe get to grow me a few flowers -And a nice big basement -


---

## RUTH:
Walter, honey, be glad -


---

## MAMA:
'Course I don't want to make it sound fancier than it is - It's just a plain little old house - but it's built good and solid and it will be ours. Walter Lee - it makes a difference in a man when he can walk on floors that belong to him -


---

## RUTH:
Where is it?


---

## MAMA:
Well - well - it's out there in Clybourne Park -


---

## RUTH:
Where?


---

## MAMA:
406 Clybourne Street, Clybourne Park.


---

## RUTH:
Clybourne Park? Mama, there ain't no colored people living in Clybourne Park.


---

## MAMA:
Well, there's going to be some now.


---

## WALTER:
So that's the peace and comfort you went out and bought for us today!


---

## MAMA:
Son - I just tried to find the nicest place for the least amount of money for my family.


---

## RUTH:
Well- well - 'course I ain't one never been 'fraid of no crackers, mind you - but - well - wasn't there no other houses... nowhere?


---

## MAMA:
Them houses they put up for colored in them areas way out all seem to cost twice as much as other houses. I did the best I could.


---

## RUTH:
Well - WELL! -All I can say is - if this is my time in life - my time - to say good-bye - to these Goddamned cracking walls! – 

---

and these marching roaches! – 

---


and that cramped little closet which ain't now or never was no kitchen! - then I say it loud and good, 

---

HALLELUYAH! AND GOODBYE, MISERY - I DON'T NEVER WANT TO SEE YOUR UGLY FACE AGAIN!
Lena -?


---

## MAMA:
Yes, honey-?


---

## RUTH:
Is there - is there a whole lot of sunlight?


---

## MAMA:
Yes, child, there's a whole lot of sunlight.


---

## RUTH:
Well - I guess I better see 'bout Travis. 
Lord, I sure don't feel like whipping nobody today!


---

## MAMA:
Son - you - you understand what I done, don't you? I - I just seen my family falling apart today - just falling to pieces in front of my eyes. 

---

We couldn't of gone on like we was today. 

---

We was going backwards 'stead of forwards - talking 'bout killing babies and wishing each other was dead. 

---

When it gets like that in life - you just got to do something different, push on out and do something bigger – 

---


I wish you say something, son - I wish you'd say how deep inside you think I done the right thing -


---

## WALTER:
What you need me to say you done right for? You the head of this family. 

---

You run our lives like you want to. 

---

It was your money and you did what you wanted with it. So what you need for me to say it was alright for? 

---


So you butchered up a dream of mine - you – 
who always talking 'bout your children's dreams-


---

## MAMA:
Walter Let-


---

## BENEATHA:
George! Please!

---

## GEORGE:
O.K - O.K, whatever you say-

---

Look, we've had a nice evening; let's not spoil it, huh?


---

## BENEATHA:
I'm trying to talk to you.


---

## GEORGE:
We always talk.


---

## BENEATHA:
Yes - and I love to talk.


---

## GEORGE:
I know it and I don't mind it sometimes - 

---

Look, I want you to cut it out, see - the moody stuff. I don't like it. You're a nice-looking girl - all over. 

---

That's all you need, honey, forget the atmosphere. Guys aren't going to go for the atmosphere - they're going to go for what they see. 

---

Be glad for that. Beneatha, please drop the Garbo routine. It doesn't go with you. As for myself, I want a nice – simple – sophisticated girl.

---


Not a poet - O.K?

---

## BENEATHA:
George, why are you angry?


---

## GEORGE:
Because this is stupid! I don't go out with you to discuss the nature of quiet desperation or to hear all your thoughts - because the world will go on thinking what it thinks regardless -


---

## BENEATHA:
Then why read books? Why go to school?


---

## GEORGE:
It's simple. You read books - to learn facts - to get grades - to pass the course - to get a degree. That's all - it has nothing to do with thoughts.


---

## BENEATHA:
I see. 
Good night, George.


---

## MAMA:
Hello, George, how are you feeling?


---

## GEORGE:
Fine - fine; how are you?


---

## MAMA:
Oh, a little tired. You know them steps can get you after a day's work. You all have a nice time at the game?


---

## GEORGE:
Yes - a fine time! A fine time!


---

## MAMA:
Well, good night, George.
Hello, honey - What you sitting like that for?


---

## BENEATHA:
I'm just sitting.


---

## MAMA:
Well, now that your company's gone, why don't you make up Travis' bed?


---

## MAMA:
Didn't you have a nice time?


---

## BENEATHA:
No.


---

## MAMA:
No? What's the matter?


---

## BENEATHA:
Mama, George is a fool - honest.


---

## MAMA:
Is he, baby?


---

## BENEATHA:
Yes. 


---

## MAMA:
You sure?


---

## BENEATHA:
Yes.


---

## MAMA:
Well - I guess you better not waste your time with no fools.


---

## BENEATHA:
Mama -


---

## MAMA:
Yes, baby – 


---

## BENEATHA:
Thank you. 


---

## MAMA:
For what?


---

## BENEATHA:
For understanding me this time.

---

The phone rings.

## RUTH:
Now don't you fool with any of that stuff, Lena -


---

## MAMA:
Oh, I just thought I'd sort a few things out. Is Brother here?


---

## RUTH:
Yes.


---

## MAMA:
Is he -


---

## RUTH:
Yes.


---

## MAMA:
Oh - hello there, Mrs. Johnson.


---

## MRS. JOHNSON:
Hello there, yourself! H'you this evening, Ruth?


---

## RUTH:
Fine, Mis' Johnson, h'you?


---

## MRS. JOHNSON:
Fine, 
Ain't you starting to poke out none yet!
Oh, ain't we getting ready round here, though! Yessir! Lookathere! I'm telling you the Youngers is really getting ready to "move on up a little higher!" - Bless God!


---

## MAMA:
Bless God.


---

## MRS. JOHNSON:
He's good, ain't He?


---

## MAMA:
Oh yes, He's good.


---

## MRS. JOHNSON:
I mean sometimes He works in mysterious ways... but He works, don't He!


---

## MAMA:
Yes, he does.


---

## MRS. JOHNSON:
I'm just soooooo happy for y'all. And this here child – looks like she could just pop open with happiness, don't she. Where's all the rest of the family?


---

## MAMA:
Bennie's gone to bed -


---

## MRS. JOHNSON:
Ain't no... sickness done hit you – I hope...?


---

## MAMA:
No - she just tired. She was out this evening.


---

## MRS. JOHNSON:
Aw - ain't that lovely. She still going out with the little Murchison boy?


---

## MAMA: 
Ummmm huh.


---

## MRS. JOHNSON:
That's lovely. You sure got lovely children, Younger. Me and Isaiah talks all the time 'bout what fine children you was blessed with. We sure do.

---

## MAMA:
Ruth, give Mis’ Johnson a piece of sweet potato pie and some milk. 


---

## MRS. JOHNSON:
Oh honey, I can’t stay hardly a minute – I just dropped in to see if there was anything I could do. I guess y’all seen the news whats all over the colored paper this week….


---

## MAMA:
No – didn’t get mine yet this week. 


---

## MRS. JOHNSON:
You mean you ain’t read ‘bout them colored people that was bombed out their place out there? 


---

## MRS. JOHNSON:
Ain’t it something how bad these here white folks is getting here in Chicago! 

---

Lord, getting so you think you right down in Mississippi 

---

‘Course I thinks it’s wonderful how our folks keeps on pushing out. You hear some of these Negroes round here talking ‘bout how they don’t go where they ain’t wanted and all that – but not me, honey! 

---

Wilhemenia Othella Johnson goes anywhere, any time she feels like it! Yes I do! Why if we left it up to these here crackers, the poor niggers wouldn’t have nothing – . 

---

Oh, I always forgets you don’t ‘low that word in your house.

---

## MAMA:
No - I don't 'low it.

---

## MRS. JOHNSON:
Me neither! I was just telling Isaiah yesterday when he come home using it in front of me - I said, "Isaiah, it's just like Mis' Younger says all the time-"

---

## MAMA:
Don't you want some more pie?

---

## MRS. JOHNSON:
No - no thank you; this was lovely. I got to get on over home and have my midnight coffee.

---

I hear some people say it don't let them sleep but I finds I can't close my eyes right lessen I done had that laaaast cup of coffee...

---

My Goodnight coffee, I calls it!

## MAMA:
Ruth, why don't you give Mis' Johnson her Goodnight Coffee.

## MRS. JOHNSON:
Where's Brother tonight?

## MAMA:
He's lying down.

## MRS. JOHNSON:
Mmmmmm, he sure gets his beauty rest, don't he? Good-looking man. Sure is a good-looking man! I guess that's how come we keep having babies around here.

---

One thing 'bout Brother, he always know how to have a good time. And soooooo ambitious! I bet it was his idea y'all moving out to Clybourne Park. Lord - I bet this time next month y'all's names will have been in the papers plenty- "NEGROES INVADE CLYBOURNE PARK - BOMBED!"

## MAMA:
We ain't exactly moving out there to get bombed.

## MRS. JOHNSON:
Oh honey - you know I'm praying to God every day that don't nothing like that happen! 

---

But you have to think of life like it is - and these here Chicago peckerwoods is some baaaad peckerwoods.


---

## MAMA:
We done thought about all that, Mis' Johnson.


---

## MRS. JOHNSON:
Hello there, Bennie! 


---

## BENEATHA:
Hello, Mrs. Johnson. 


---

## MRS. JOHNSON:
How is school?


---

## BENEATHA:
Fine, thank you. 


---

## MRS. JOHNSON:
Getting so she don't have much to say to nobody.


---

## MAMA:
The child was on her way to the bathroom.


---

## MRS. JOHNSON:
I know - but sometimes she act like ain't got time to pass the time of day with nobody ain't been to college. 

---

Oh - I ain't criticizing her none. It's just - you know how some of our young people gets when they get a little education.

---


Yes - well. Well, I guess I better get on home. 

---


'Course I can understand how she must be proud and everything - being the only one in the family to make something of herself! 

---

I know just being a chauffeur ain't never satisfied Brother none. He shouldn't feel like that, though. 

---

Ain't nothing wrong with being a chauffeur.


---

## MAMA:
There's plenty wrong with it.


---

## MRS. JOHNSON:
What?


---

## MAMA:
Plenty. My husband always said being any kind of a servant wasn't a fit thing for a man to have to be. 

---

He always said a man's hands was made to make things, or to turn the earth with - not to drive nobody's car for 'em - or – 

---

Carry they slop jars. And my boy is just like him - he wasn't meant to wait on nobody.


---

## MRS. JOHNSON:
Mmmmm mmmm. The Youngers is too much for me! 

---


You sure one proud-acting bunch of colored folks. 

---

Well - I always thinks like Booker T. Washington said that time - "Education has spoiled many a good plow hand" -


---

## MAMA:
Is that what old Booker T. said?


---

## MRS. JOHNSON:
He sure did.


---

## MAMA:
Well, it sounds just like him. 
The fool.


---

## MRS. JOHNSON:
Well - he was one of our great men.


---

## MAMA:
Who said so?


---

## MRS. JOHNSON:
You know, me and you ain't never agreed about some things, Lena Younger. I guess I better be going -


---

## RUTH:
Good night.


---

## MRS. JOHNSON:
Good night. Oh – 
You can keep the paper! 


---

## MAMA:
Good night, Mis' Johnson.

---

## MRS. JOHNSON:
Nighty-night.


---

## RUTH:
If ignorance was gold...


---

## MAMA:
Shush. Don't talk about folks behind their backs.


---

## RUTH:
You do.


---

## MAMA:
I'm old and corrupted. 
You was rude to Mis' Johnson, Beneatha, and I don't like it at all.


---

## BENEATHA:
Mama, if there are two things we, as a people, have got to overcome, one is the Ku Klux Klan - and the other is… 

---

Wilhemenia Othella Johnson! 


---

## MAMA:
Smart aleck.

---

The phone rings.

---

## RUTH:
I'll get it.


---

## MAMA:
Lord, ain't this a popular place tonight.

---


## RUTH:
Hello - Just a minute. 
Walter, it's Mrs. Arnold. 

---


Hello - Yes, this is his wife speaking - He's lying down now- Yes -well, he'll be in tomorrow. He's been very sick-


---

## RUTH:
Yes - I know we should have called, but we were so sure he'd be able to come in today- Yes-yes, I'm very sorry - Yes - Thank you very much.
That was Mrs. Arnold.


---

## WALTER:
Was it?

---

He plays "Round Midnight" by Thelonius Monk on the Radio.

---

## RUTH:
She said if you don't come in tomorrow that they are getting a new man -


---

## WALTER:
Ain't that sad - ain't that crying sad?


---

## RUTH:
She said Mr. Arnold has had to take a cab for three days - Walter, you ain't been to work for three days! 

---


Where you been, Walter Lee Younger?

---


You're going to lose your job.


---

## WALTER:
That's right


---

## RUTH:
Oh, Walter, and with your mother working like a dog every day -


---

## WALTER:
That's sad, too - Everything is sad.


---

## MAMA:
What you been doing these three days, Son?


---

## WALTER:
Mama - you don't know all the things a man what got "leisure" can find to do in this city. 

---

What's this - Friday night? Well - Wednesday I borrowed Willy Harris' car and I went for a drive - just me and myself, and I drove and drove - way out - way past South Chicago, 

---

and I parked the car and I sat and looked at the steel mills all day long. 

---

I just sat and looked at them big black chimneys for hours. Then I drove back and I went to - the Green Hat. 

---

And Thursday - Thursday I borrowed the car again and I pointed it the other way and I drove 
for hours - way, way up to Wisconsin, and I looked at the farms. 

---

I just drove and looked at the farms. Then I drove back and I went to the Green Hat. And today - today I didn't get the car. 

---

Today I just walked all over the Southside. And I looked at – 
the Negroes and they looked at me, 

---

and finally I sat down on the curb at 39th and South Parkway and I just sat there and watched the Negroes go by. 

---

And then I went to the Green Hat.
Y'all sad? Y'all depressed? 


---

And you know where I am going right now -?


---

## MAMA:
Big Walter, is this the harvest of our days?


---

## WALTER:
You know what I like about the Green Hat -?

---


I like this little cat they got there who blows a sax. 

---


He blows. He talks to me. 

---

He ain't but 'bout five feet tall and he's got a conked head, and his eyes is always closed and he's all music -


---

## MAMA:
Walter -


---

## WALTER:
And there's another fellow who plays the piano - and they got a sound. 

---

I mean they can work on some music - They got the best little combo in the world in the Green Hat - 

---

You can just sit there and drink and listen to them three men play, and you realize that don't nothing count worth a damn, but being there -


---

## MAMA:
I've helped do it to you, haven't I, son? Walter, I been wrong.


---

## WALTER:
Naw -you ain't never been wrong about nothing, Mama.


---

## MAMA:
Listen to me now. I say I been wrong, son. That I been doing to you what the rest of the world been doing to you. 

---


Walter -
'What you ain't never understood is that I ain't got nothing, don't own nothing, ain't never really wanted nothing that wasn't for you. 

---

There ain't nothing as precious to me - there ain't nothing worth holding on to, money, dreams, nothing else - if it means - if it means it's going to destroy my boy.

---


I paid the man thirty-five hundred dollars down on the house. 

---

That leaves sixty-five hundred dollars. Monday morning I want you to take this money and put three thousand dollars in a savings account for Beneatha's medical schooling.

---


The rest you put in a checking account - with your name on it. 

---

And from now on any penny that comes out of it or go in it is for you to look after. For you to decide,
It ain't much, but it's all I got in the world and I'm putting it in your hands. 

---

I'm telling you to be the head of this family like you supposed to be.


---

## WALTER:
Mama – You trust me like that, Mama?


---

## MAMA:
I ain't never stop trustin' you. Like I ain't never stop lovin' you.

---


## TRAVIS:
What's the matter, Daddy? You drunk?


---

## WALTER:
No, Daddy ain't drunk. Daddy ain't going to never be drunk again.


---

## TRAVIS:
Well, good night, Daddy. 


---

## WALTER:
Son, I feel like talking to you tonight.


---

## TRAVIS:
About what?


---

## WALTER:
Oh, about a lot of things.

---


About you and what kind of man you going to be when you grow up ... Son - son, what do you want to be when you grow up?


---

## TRAVIS:
A bus driver.


---

## WALTER:
A what? Man, that ain't nothing to want to be!


---

## TRAVIS:
Why not?


---

## WALTER:
'Cause, man - it ain't big enough - you know what I mean.


---

## TRAVIS:
I don't know then. Sometimes Mama asks me that too. And when I tell her I just want to be like you, she says she don't want me to be like that. And sometimes she says she does.


---

## WALTER:
You know what, Travis? In seven years, you going to be seventeen years old. 

---

And things is going to be very different with us. And one day when you are seventeen I'll come home - home from my office -


---

## TRAVIS:
You don't work in no office, Daddy.


---

## WALTER:
No - but after tonight. After what your daddy gonna do tonight, there's going to be offices - a whole lot of offices. 


---

## TRAVIS:
What you gonna do tonight, Daddy?


---

## WALTER:
You wouldn't understand yet, son, but your daddy's gonna make a transaction. 

---

A business transaction that's going to change our lives. 

---

That's how come one day when you 'bout seventeen I'll come home and I'll be pretty tired, you know what I mean, after a day of conferences and secretaries getting things wrong the way they do ... 'cause an executive's life is hell, man!

---

And I'll pull the car up the driveway... just a plain black Chrysler, I think, with white walls - no - black tires. More elegant. 

---

Rich people don't have to be flashy... though I'll have to get something a little sportier for Ruth - maybe a Cadillac convertible to do her shopping in. 

---

And I'll come up the steps to the house and the gardener will be clipping away at the hedges and he’ll say, "Good evening, Mr. Younger." 

---

And I'll say, "Hello, Jefferson, how are you this evening?" 

---

And I'll go inside and Ruth will meet me at the door and we'll kiss and she'll take my arm and we'll go upstairs to your room to see you sitting on the floor with the catalogues of all the great schools in America around you. 

---

All the great schools in the world! 

---

And - and I'll say, alright son - it's your seventeenth birthday, what is it you've decided? Just tell me where you want to go to school and you'll go. Just tell me, what it is you want to be- and you'll be it... 

---

Whatever you want to be -Yessir! 

---


You just name it, son -

---


And I'll hand you the world!

---

"City Burns" by Andra Day plays:
"The scent of momentum fills the city air
Hear the heart beat, it's alive and draws you in
Things will never be the same
Thought I'd been here, but never here, times before
Then the roller coaster dipped and sped along no more
But I'm not in the same space
'Cause I'm hardly the woman that I once was
Now I search for the ground underneath my feet
As the city burns, as the city burns
Ooh
As the city burns
Ooh
As the city burns
Ooh
As the city burns
Burn away
Burn away
Now it's fancy ladies, pricey wiles, and argyle
From homemade beats, selling tee's, and running wild
Just hope I don't lose my head
Now I'm thinking on a dream that my sister had
Back then I was too young..."

---

## RUTH:
Hey!


---

## BENEATHA:
Hi.


---

## RUTH:
Honey - look in that package there and see what I found on sale at the South Center. 
Lookahere - hand-turned hems!


---

## BENEATHA:
How do you know the window size out there -? 


---

## RUTH:
Oh - Well, they bound to fit something in the whole house. Anyhow, they was too good a bargain to pass up. 

---


Oh, Bennie - I meant to put a special note on that carton. That's your mama's good china.


---

## BENEATHA:
I'll do it. 


---

## RUTH:
You know what I'm going to do soon as I get in that house?


---

## BENEATHA:
What?


---

## RUTH:
Honey - I'm going to run me a tub of water up to here – 

---


and I'm going to get in it - and I am going to sit - and sit - and sit and the first person who knocks -


---

## BENEATHA:
Gets shot at sunrise!


---

## RUTH:
You said it, sister!
Honey, they ain't going to read that from no airplane.


---

## BENEATHA: 
I guess I always think things have more emphasis if they are big, somehow.


---

## RUTH:
You and your brother seem to have that as a philosophy of life. Lord, that man - done changed so 'round here. 

---

You know what we did last night? Me and Walter Lee?


---

## BENEATHA:
What -?


---

## RUTH:
We went to the movies. 

---


We went to the movies. You know the last time me and Walter went to the movies together?


---

## BENEATHA:
No.


---

## RUTH:
Me, neither. That's how long it been. 

---


But we went last night. Picture wasn't much good, but that didn't matter. We went - and we held hands.


---

## BENEATHA:
Oh lord!


---

## RUTH:
We held hands - and you know what?


---

## BENEATHA:
What?


---

## RUTH:
When we come out of the show it was late and dark and all the stores and things was closed up - and it was kind of chilly and there wasn't many people on the streets - and we was still holding hands, me and Walter.


---

## BENEATHA:
You're killing me.


---

Walter whistles.

---

"Sweet Thing" by Chaka Khan plays.

---

## BENEATHA:
Talk about- oldddddddd-fashionedddddd-Negroes!


---

## WALTER:
What kind of Negroes?


---

## BENEATHA:
Old-fashioned.


---

## WALTER:
You know when all these professional new Negroes have their convention 
that is going to be the chairman of the committee on unending agitation. 

---


Race, race, race - Girl, I do believe you are the first person in the history of the entire human race to successfully brainwash your own self!

---


Damn, even the N DOUBLE A C P takes a holiday sometimes!

---


I can just see that chick someday looking down at some poor cat on the operating table -
- and before she starts to slice him, she'll say: 

---


Now what did you say your views on Civil Rights were -?

---


The door bell rings.


---

## BENEATHA:
Sticks and stones may break my bones but – 
words will never hurt me!

---

A knock on the door.

---

## MAN: 
Uh - How do you do, Miss? I am looking for a Mrs. -
Mrs. Lena Younger -?


---

## BENEATHA:
Oh- yes, that's my mother. Excuse me. 
Ruth! Brother! 

---


"There's a WHITE MAN at the door!"

---

The record stops. 


---

## BENEATHA:
Uh - come in please.

---


## MAN:
Thank you.


---

## BENEATHA:
My mother isn't here just now. Is it business?

---


## MAN:
Yes - well, of a sort.


---

## WALTER:
Have a seat.

---


## MAN:
Thank you.


---

## WALTER:
I'm Mrs. Younger's son. I look after most of her business matters.

---


## MAN:
Well - My name is Karl Lindner -


---

## WALTER:
Walter Younger.
This is my wife -
And my sister.


---

## LINDNER:
How do you do?


---

## WALTER:
What can we do for you, Mr. Lindner!


---

## LINDNER:
Well - I am a representative of the Clybourne Park Improvement Association -

---


## WALTER:
Why don't you sit your things on the couch?


---

## LINDNER:
Oh - yes. Thank you. 

---


And as I was saying - I am from the Clybourne Park Improvement Association, and we have had it brought to our attention that you people - or at least your mother - has bought a piece of residential property at 406 Clybourne Street -


---

## WALTER:
That's right. Care for something to drink? Ruth, get Mr. Lindner a beer.


---

## LINDNER:
Oh - no, really. I mean thank you very much, but no, thank you.


---

## RUTH:
Some coffee?


---

## LINDNER:
Thank you, nothing at all. 
Well, I don't know how much you folks know about our organization. 
It is one of these community organizations set up to look after - oh, you know things like block upkeep and special projects, and we also have what we call our New Neighbors Orientation Committee -



---

## BENEATHA:
Yes - and what do they do?


---

## LINDNER:
Well - it's what you might call a sort of Welcoming Committee, I guess. I mean they, we, I'm the chairman - go around and see the new people who move into the neighborhood and sort of give 'em the lowdown on the way we do things out in Clybourne Park.


---

## BENEATHA:
Uh-huh.


---

## LINDNER:
And we also have the category of what the Association calls uh - special community problems -


---

## BENEATHA:
Yes - and what are some of those?


---

## WALTER:
Girl, let the man talk.


---

## LINDNER:
Thank you. I would sort of like to explain this thing in my own way. I mean I want to explain in a certain way.


---

## WALTER:
Go ahead.


---

## LINDNER:
Yes. Well. I'm going to try to get right to the point. I'm sure we'll all appreciate that in the long run.


---

## BENEATHA:
Yes.


---

## WALTER:
Be still now!


---

## LINDNER:
Well -


---

## RUTH:
Would you like another chair -you don't look comfortable.


---

## LINDNER:
No, thank you very much. Please. Well - to get right to the point I – 

---

I am sure you people must be aware of some of the incidents that have happened when colored people move into certain areas - Well - because we have what I think is going to be a unique type of organization in American community life -not only do we deplore that kind of thing - but we are trying to do something about it.

---


We feel – 
We feel that most of the trouble in this world, when you come right down to it – 
Most of the trouble exists because people just don't sit down and talk to each other.


---

## RUTH:
You can say that again, Mister.


---

## LINDNER:
That we don't try hard enough to understand the other fellow's problem. The other guy's point of view.


---

## RUTH:
Now that's right.


---

## LINDNER:
Yes - and that's why I was elected to come here this afternoon and talk to you people and see if we couldn't find some way to work this thing out. Anybody can see that you are a nice family of folks, hardworking and honest, I'm sure. Today everybody knows what it means to be an outsider. And of course, there is always somebody who is out to take advantage of people who don't understand.


---

## WALTER:
What do you mean?


---

## LINDNER:
Well - you see our community is made up of people who've worked hard as the dickens for years to build up that little community. 

---

We're not rich and fancy people; just hard-working honest people who don't really have much but those little homes and a dream of the kind of community we want to raise our children in. 

---

Now I don't say we are perfect and there is a lot wrong in some of the things we want. But you've got to admit that a man, right or wrong, has the right to want to have the neighborhood he lives in a certain kind of way. 

---

And at the moment the overwhelming majority of our people out there feel that people get along better; take more of a common interest in the life of the community when they share a common background.

---

Now I want you to believe me when I tell you that race prejudice simply doesn't enter into it. 

---

It is a matter of the people of Clybourne Park believing, rightly or wrongly, as I say, that for the happiness of all concerned that our Negro families are happier when they live in their own communities.


---

## BENEATHA:
This, friends, is the Welcoming Committee!


---

## WALTER:
Is this what you came marching all the way over here to tell us?


---

## LINDNER:
Well now we've been having a fine conversation. I hope you'll hear me all the way through.


---

## WALTER:
Go ahead, man.


---

## LINDNER:
You see - in the face of all the things I have said, we are prepared to make your family a very generous offer -


---

## BENEATHA:
Thirty pieces and not a coin less!


---

## WALTER:
Yeah -?


---

## LINDNER:
Our association is prepared through the collective effort of our people to buy the house from you at a financial gain to your family.


---

## RUTH:
Lord have mercy, ain't this the living gall!


---

## WALTER:
Alright, you through? 


---

## LINDNER:
Well, I want to give you the exact terms of the arrangement -


---

## WALTER:
We don't want to hear no exact terms of no arrangements. I want to know if you got any more to tell 'bout getting together.


---

## LINDNER:
Well - I don't suppose that you feel -


---

## WALTER:
Never mind how I feel -you got any more to say 'bout how people ought to sit down and talk to each other?
Get out of my house, man.


---

## LINDNER:
I don't understand why you people are reacting this way. What do you think you are going to gain by moving where you - aren't wanted and where some elements - well - people can get awful worked up when they feel that their whole way of life and everything, they've ever worked for is threatened -


---

## WALTER:
Get out.


---

## LINDNER:
Well, I'm sorry it went like this.


---

## WALTER:
Get out!


---

## LINDNER:
You just can't force people to change their hearts, son. Here's my card.


---

## MAMA:
Well - this all the packing got done since I left out of here this morning? I testify before God that my children got all the energy of the dead! What time the moving men due -?


---

## BENEATHA:
Four o'clock. You had a caller, Mama.


---

## MAMA:
Sure enough -who?


---

## BENEATHA:
The Welcoming Committee.


---

## MAMA:
Who?


---

## BENEATHA:
The Welcoming Committee. They said they're sure going to be glad to see you when you get there.


---

## WALTER:
Yeah, they said they can't hardly wait to see your face. 


---

## MAMA:
What's the matter with you all?


---

## WALTER:
Ain't nothing the matter with us. We just telling you 'bout the gentleman who came to see you. From the Clybourne Park Improvement Association.


---

## MAMA:
What he want?


---

## RUTH:
To welcome you, honey.


---

## WALTER:
He said - He said if it's one thing they don't have that they just DYING to have out there and that's a fine family of fine colored people!


---

## RUTH:
Yeah! He left his card -


---

## BENEATHA:
In case.


---

## MAMA:
Father, give us strength. 
Did he threaten us?


---

## BENEATHA:
Oh, Mama - they don't do it like that anymore. He talked Brotherhood. He said everybody ought to learn how to sit down and hate each other with good Christian fellowship.


---

## MAMA:
Lord, protect us -


---

## RUTH:
You should hear the money those folks raised to buy the house back. All we paid and then some.

## BENEATHA:
What they think we going to do - eat 'em?


---

## RUTH:
No, honey, marry 'em.


---

## MAMA:
Lord, Lord, Lord -


---

## RUTH:
Well - that's the way the crackers crumble.
Joke.


---

## BENEATHA:
Mama, what are you doing?


---

## MAMA:
Fixing my plant so it won't get hurt none on the way-


---

## BENEATHA:
Mama, you going to take that to the new house?


---

## MAMA:
Uh huh -


---

## BENEATHA:
That raggedy-looking old thing?!


---

## MAMA:
It- expresses ME!


---

## RUTH:
So there! Miss Thing!


---

## MAMA:
Look out now, boy! You make me mess up my thing here!


---

## WALTER:
Mama -you know what it means to climb up in the chariot?


---

## MAMA:
Get on away from me now -


---

## RUTH:
Psst -


---

## WALTER:
What the old song say, Mama?


---

## RUTH:
Walter - Now?


---

## WALTER:
(Singing) 
"I got wings - You got wings -All God's children got wings - "


---

## MAMA:
Boy - get out of my face and do some work -


---

## WALTER:
'When I get to heaven gonna put on them wings. I'm gonna fly all over God's heaven - "


---

## BENEATHA:
Everybody talking 'bout heaven ain't going there!


---

## WALTER:
I don't know. You think we ought to give her this- Seems to me she ain't been very co-operative around here.


---

## MAMA:
What is it?


---

## WALTER:
Well - what y'all think? Should we give it to her?


---

## RUTH:
Oh - she was pretty good today.


---

## MAMA:
I'll good you -


---

## BENEATHA:
Open it, Mama.


---

## WALTER:
Open it, Mama. It's for you.
Read the note, Mama. Ruth wrote the note.


---

## MAMA:
"To our own Mrs. Miniver - Love from Brother, Ruth and Beneatha:" Ain't that lovely. Thank you, son.


---

## TRAVIS:
Daddy, can I give her mine now?


---

## WALTER:
Alright, son.


---

## MAMA:
Now I don't have to use my knives and forks no more!


---

## WALTER:
Travis didn't want to go in with the rest of us, Mama. He got his own.
We don't know what it is -


---

## TRAVIS:
Here!


---

## MAMA:
Lord have mercy, Baby. You done brought your grandmother a hat?


---

## TRAVIS:
Open it!


---

## RUTH:
Travis, honey, what is that?


---

## TRAVIS:
It's a gardening hat! Like the ladies always have on in the magazines when they work in their gardens.


---

## BENEATHA:
Travis -we were trying to make Mama "Mrs. Miniver" - not Scarlet O'Hara!


---

## MAMA:
What's the matter with y'all! This here is a beautiful hat! 
l always wanted me one just like it!


---

## RUTH:
Hot dog! Go, Mama!


---

## WALTER: 
I'm sorry, Mama - but you look like you ready to go out and chop you some cotton, sure enough!


---

## MAMA:
Bless your heart - this is the prettiest hat I ever owned!
What we all standing around here for? We ain't finished packin' yet. Bennie, you ain't packed one book.

---

A knock on the door.

---

## BENEATHA:
That couldn't be the movers - it's not hardly two good yet -


---

## WALTER:
Wait -wait - I'll get it.


---

## MAMA:
You expecting company, son?


---

## WALTER:
Yeah -yeah -


---

## MAMA:
Travis - you run to the hardware and get me some string cord.


---

## RUTH:
Why don't you answer the door, man?


---

## WALTER:
'Cause sometimes it hard to let the future begin! 
"I got wings! You got wings!"
''When I get to heaven - "
" - gonna put on my wings - "
Where's Willy, man?


---

## BOBO:
He ain't with me.


---

## WALTER:
Oh - come on in. You know my wife.


---

## BOBO:
Yes -h'you, Miss Ruth, 


---

## RUTH:
Hello Bobo.


---

## WALTER:
You right on time today - right on time. That's the way! 
Sit down - lemme hear.


---

## BOBO:
Could I please get a drink of water, before I tell you about it, Walter Lee?


---

## WALTER:
There ain't nothing wrong, is there -


---

## BOBO:
Lemme tell you - Walter Lee.
You know how it was. I got to tell you how it was. I mean first I got to tell you how it was all the way - I mean about the money I put in, Walter Lee -


---

## WALTER:
What about the money you put in?


---

## BOBO:
Well - it wasn't much as we told you - me and Willy – 
I'm sorry, Walter: I got a bad feeling about it. I got a real bad feeling about it - 


---

## WALTER:
Man, what you telling me all this for - Tell me what happened in Springfield -


---

## BOBO:
Springfield.


---

## RUTH:
What was supposed to happen in Springfield?


---

## BOBO:
This deal that me and Walter went into with Willy - Me and Willy was going to go down to Springfield and spread some money round so's we wouldn't have to wait so long for the liquor license - I mean everybody said that was the way you had to do, you understand, Miss Ruth?


---

## WALTER:
Man - what happened down there?


---

## BOBO:
I'm trying to tell you, Walter.


---

## WALTER:
THEN TELL ME, GODDAMNIT - WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?


---

## BOBO:
Man - I didn't go to no Springfield, yesterday.


---

## WALTER:
Why not?


---

## BOBO:
'Cause I didn't have no reasons to -


---

## WALTER:
Man, what are you talking about!


---

## BOBO:
I'm talking about the fact that when I got to the train station yesterday morning - eight o'clock like we planned - Man - Willy didn't never show up.


---

## WALTER:
Why- where was he - where is he?


---

## BOBO:
That's what I'm trying to tell you - I don't know. I waited six hours - I called his house - and I waited - six hours - I waited in that train station six hour -
Man, Willy is gone.


---

## WALTER:
Gone, what you mean Willy is gone? Gone where? You mean he went by himself. Yeah, sure -
Maybe he didn't want too many people in on the business down there. 
You know Willy got his own ways.
Maybe you was late yesterday and he just went on down there without you.
Maybe - maybe - he's callin' you at home right now. Maybe - maybe - he just got sick. He's somewhere - he's got to be somewhere. We just got to find him – 
WE GOT TO!


---

## BOBO:
What's the matter with you, Walter! When a cat take off with your money he don't leave you no road maps!


---

## WALTER:
No, willy! ... willy, don't do it! ... please don't do it ... man, not with that money! man, please, not with that money ... oh, God - don't let it be true -

---


MAN - I TRUSTED YOU! ... MAN, I PUT MY LIFE IN YOUR HANDS! ... MAN - THAT MONEY IS MADE OUT OF MY FATHER'S FLESH -!


---

## BOBO:
I'm sorry, Walter - I had my life staked on this deal, too -


---

## MAMA:
Son -
Son - Is it gone? Son, I gave you sixty-five hundred dollars. Is it gone? All of it? Beneatha's money, too?


---

## WALTER:
Mama - I never - went to the bank at all -


---

## MAMA:
You mean your sister's school money - you used that too?


---

## WALTER:
Yes, all of it - it's all gone -


---

## MAMA:
I seen - him - night after night - come in - and look at that rug - and then look at me - the red showing in his eyes - the veins moving in his head - 

---

I seen him grow thin and old before he was forty - working and working and working like somebody's old horse - killing himself. And you - YOU GIVE IT ALL AWAY IN ONE DAY -!


---

## BENEATHA:
Mama -


---

## MAMA:
Oh, God – 
Look down here - and show me the strength.


---

## BENEATHA:
Mama -


---

## MAMA:
Father - strength – 


---

## BENEATHA:
Mama – 


---

## MAMA:
Strength!

"I Know I've Been Changed" by LaShun Pace plays:
"I know I've been changed, hey, oh, I know I've been changed
You know, I know, I know I've been changed
You know the angels in Heaven done signed my name
You know that (I know I've been changed)
I said that (I know I've been changed)"

---

A knock on the door.

---

## ASAGAI:
I came over - I thought I might help with the packing. Ah, I like the look of packing crates! 

---

A household in preparation for a journey! It depresses some people - but for me - it is another feeling. Something full of the flow of life, do you understand? 

---

Movement, progress - it makes me think of Africa.


---

## BENEATHA:
Africa!


---

## ASAGAI:
What kind of mood is this? Have I told you how deeply you move me?


---

## BENEATHA:
He gave away the money, Asagai –


---

## ASAGAI:
Who gave away what money?


---

## BENEATHA:
The insurance money. My brother gave it away.


---

## ASAGAI:
Gave it away?


---

## BENEATHA:
He made an investment! With a man even Travis wouldn't have trusted!


---

## ASAGAI:
And it's gone?


---

## BENEATHA:
Gone!


---

## ASAGAI:
I'm very sorry- And you now?


---

## BENEATHA:
Me? - Me? Me, I'm nothing - Me. When I was very small - we used to take our sleds out in the wintertime and the only hills we had were some ice-covered stone steps down the street. 

---

And we used to fill them with snow and make them smooth and slide down them all day - and it was very dangerous, you know - far too steep - and sure enough one day a kid named Rufus came down too fast and hit the sidewalk - and his face just split open right there in front of us - 

---

And I remember standing there looking at his bloody open face thinking that was the end of Rufus. But the ambulance came, and they took him to the hospital, and they fixed the broken bones, and they sewed it all up - 

---

and the next time I saw Rufus he just had a little line down the middle of his face - I never got over that-


---

## ASAGAI:
What?


---

## BENEATHA:
That that was what one human being could do for another, fix him up - sew up the problem, make him alright again. 

---

That was the most marvelous thing in the world - I wanted to do that. I always thought it was the one concrete thing in the world that a human being could do. Fix up the sick, you know - and make them whole again. 

---

This was truly being God -

---


## ASAGAI: 
You wanted to be God -?


---

## BENEATHA:
No-I wanted to cure. It used to be so important to me. I wanted to cure. I used to care. I mean about people and how their bodies hurt -


---

## ASAGAI:
And you’ve stopped caring -?


---

## BENEATHA:
Yes - I think so.


---

## ASAGAI:
Why?


---

## BENEATHA:
Because it doesn’t seem deep enough, close enough to what ails mankind! It was a child's way of seeing things - or an idealist's.


---

## ASAGAI:
Children see things very well sometimes – and idealists even better.


---

## BENEATHA:
I know that's what you think. Because you are still where I left off. You still care. You with all your talk and dreams about Africa! You still think you can patch up the world. Cure the Great Sore of Colonialism – with the "penicillin of Independence!"


---

## ASAGAI:
Yes!


---

## BENEATHA:
Independence and then what? What about all the crooks and thieves and just plain idiots who will come into power to steal and plunder the same as before, only now they will be black and do it in the name of the new independence - what about them?!


---

## ASAGAI:
That will be the problem for another time. First, we must get there.


---

## BENEATHA:
And where does it end?


---

## ASAGAI:
End? Who ever spoke of an end? To life? To living? 


---

## BENEATHA:
An end to misery! To stupidity! Don't you see there isn't any real progress, Asagai, there is only one large circle that we march in, around and around, each of us with our own little picture in front of us - our own little mirage that we think is the future.


---

## ASAGAI:
That is the mistake.


---

## BENEATHA:
What?


---

## ASAGAI:
What you just said - about the circle. It isn't a circle. 

---


It is simply a long line - as in geometry, you know - one that curves into infinity. And because we cannot see the end, we also cannot see how it - changes. And it is very odd, but those who see the changes - who dream, who will not give up - are called idealists... and those who see only the circle – 

---


- they call each other the "realists!"


---

## BENEATHA:
Asagai, while I was sleeping in that bed in there, people went out and took the future right out of my hands! Nobody asked me - they just went out and changed my life!


---

## ASAGAI:
Was it your money?


---

## BENEATHA:
What?


---

## ASAGAI:
Was it your money he gave away?


---

## BENEATHA:
It belonged to all of us.


---

## ASAGAI:
But did you earn it? Would you have had it at all if your father had not died?


---

## BENEATHA:
No.


---

## ASAGAI:
Then isn't there something wrong in a house - in a world - where all dreams, good or bad, must depend on the death of a man? I never thought to see you like this, Alaiyo. You. Your brother made a mistake and you are grateful to him so that now you can give up the ailing human race on account of it! You talk about what good is struggle, what good is anything! Where are we all going and why are we bothering!


---

## BENEATHA:
And you cannot answer it!


---

## ASAGAI:
I LIVE THE ANSWER! 
In my village at home it is the exceptional man who can even read a newspaper - or who ever sees a book at all. 

---

I will go home and much of what I will have to say will seem strange to the people of my village - 

---

But I will teach and work and things will happen, slowly and swiftly. At times it will seem that nothing changes at all - and then again - the sudden dramatic events which make history leap into the future. And then quiet again. Retrogression, even. Guns, murder, revolution. 

---

And I even will have moments when I wonder if the quiet was not better than all that death and hatred. But I will look about my village at the illiteracy and disease and ignorance and I will not wonder long. And perhaps - perhaps I will be a great man –

---

I mean perhaps I will hold onto the substance of truth - and perhaps for it I will be butchered in my bed some night by the servants of empire -


---

## BENEATHA:
The martyr!


---

## ASAGAI:
Or perhaps I shall live to be a very old man, respected and esteemed in my new nation - 

---

And perhaps I shall hold office and this is what I'm trying to tell you, Alaiyo, perhaps the things I believe now for my country will be wrong and outmoded, and I will do terrible things to have things my way or merely to keep my power. 

---

Don't you see there will be young men and women, not British soldiers, but my own black countrymen - to step out of the shadows some night and slit my then useless throat? 

---

Don't you see, they have always been there - that they always will be? And that such a thing as my own death will be an advance - actually replenishing all that I was.


---

## BENEATHA:
Oh, Asagai, I know all that, 


---

## ASAGAI:
Good! Then stop moaning and groaning and tell me what you plan to do.


---

## BENEATHA:
Do?


---

## ASAGAI:
I have a bit of a suggestion.


---

## BENEATHA:
What?


---

## ASAGAI:
That when it is all over – that you come home with me –


---

## BENEATHA:
Oh -Asagai - at this moment you decide to be romantic!


---

## ASAGAI:
My dear, young creature of the New World - I do not mean across the city - I mean across the ocean: home - to Africa.


---

## BENEATHA:
To Africa?


---

## ASAGAI:
Yes! 
Three hundred years later the African Prince rose up out of the seas and swept the maiden back across the middle passage over which her ancestors had come -


---

## BENEATHA:
To - to Nigeria -


---

## ASAGAI:
Nigeria. Home.
I will show you our mountains and our stars; and give you cool drinks from gourds and teach you the old songs and the ways of our people - and in time - we will pretend that – 
-you have only been away for a day. Say that you'll come. 


---

## BENEATHA:
You're getting me all mixed up-


---

## ASAGAI:
Why -?


---

## BENEATHA:
Too many things - too much has happened today. I don't know what I feel about anything. I'm just going to sit down and think.


---

## ASAGAI:
Alright, I shall leave you. 
No - don't get up. Just sit a while and think- Never be afraid to sit a while and think, 

---


How often I have looked at you and said, "Ah - so this is what the New World hath finally wrought - "


---

## BENEATHA:
Yes - just look at what the "New World Hath Wrought!" Just look! 

---


There he is! Monsieur le petit bourgeois noir himself! There he is - Symbol of a Rising Class! Entrepreneur! Titan of the system!

---


Did you dream of yachts on Lake Michigan, Brother! Did you see yourself on that Great Day sitting down at the Conference -

---


- table, surrounded by all the mighty bald-headed men in America? All halted, waiting, breathless, for your pronouncements on industry? Waiting for you - Chairman of the Board!


---

## RUTH:
Who was that?


---

## BENEATHA:
Your husband. 


---

## RUTH:
Where did he go -?


---

## BENEATHA:
How do I know - Maybe he had an appointment at U.S. Steel. 


---

## RUTH:
 You didn't say nothing bad to him, did you?


---

## BENEATHA:
Bad -? To him? No - I told him he was a sweet boy and full of dreams and everything is strictly peachy keen!


---

## MAMA:
Well - ain't it a mess in here, though?

---


I guess we all better stop moping around and get some work done. All this unpacking and everything we got to do.

---


One of you all better call the moving people and tell 'em not to come.


---

## RUTH:
Tell 'em not to come? 


---

## MAMA:
Of course, baby. Ain't no need in 'em coming all the way here and having to go back. They charges for that, too.


---

## RUTH:
Lena, no! We gotta go. Bennie - Bennie - tell her – 

---


Tell her we can still move. The notes ain't but a hundred and twenty-five a month. 

---


We got four grown people in this house - we can work -


---

## MAMA:
This just ain't our time to be trying to take on something like that.


---

## RUTH:
Lena - I'll work! I'll work twenty hours a day in all the kitchens in Chicago! I'll strap my baby on my back if I have to - and scrub all the floors in America and wash all the sheets in America if I have to - but we got to move! We got to get out of here!


---

## MAMA:
No - I sees things differently now. Been thinking 'bout how we could fix this place up some. I seen a secondhand bureau over on Maxwell Street just the other day - fit right there.

---


And - we can put up them new curtains in the kitchen
And some nice screens in your room round the baby's bassinet - Why this place be looking fine. Cheer us all up so that we forget trouble ever come -


---

Sometimes you just got to know when to give up some things - and hold on to what you got.


---

## MAMA:
Where you been, son?


---

## WALTER:
Made a call. 


---

## MAMA:
To who, son?


---

## WALTER:
To The Man.


---

## MAMA:
What man, baby?


---

## WALTER:
The Man, Mama. Don't you know who The Man is?


---

## RUTH:
Walter Lee?


---

## WALTER:
THE MAN. Like the guys in the streets say- The Man. Captain Boss - Mistuh Charley - Old Cap'n Please Mr. Bossman.


---

## BENEATHA:
Lindner!


---

## WALTER:
That's right. That's good. I told him to come right over.


---

## BENEATHA:
For what? What do you want to see him for?


---

## WALTER:
We going to do business with him.


---

## MAMA:
What you talking 'bout, son?


---

## WALTER:
Talking 'bout life, Mama. You all always telling me to see life like it is. Well - I laid in there on my back today - and I figured it out. Life just like it is. Who gets and who don't get. 

---


Mama, you know it's all divided up. Life is. Sure enough. Between the takers and the "tooken." 

---


Yeah. And some of us always getting "tooken." 

---


People like Willy Harris, they don't never get "tooken." 

---

And you know why the rest of us do? 'Cause we all mixed up. Mixed up bad. We get to looking round for the right and the wrong; and we worry about it and cry about it and stay up nights trying to figure out 'bout the wrong and the right of things all the time - 

---

And all the time, man, them takers is out there operating, just taking and taking. 

---

Willy Harris? Shoot - Willy Harris don't even count. He don't even count in the big scheme of things. But I'll say one thing for old Willy - he's taught me something: to keep my eye on what does count in this world. Yeah. 

Thanks, Willy! 



---

## RUTH:
What did you call that man for, Walter Lee?


---

## WALTER:
Called him to come on over to the show. Gonna put on a show for The Man. Just what he wants to see. You see, Mama? The man came here today himself to tell us that them people out there where you want us to move - well, they so upset they willing to pay us not to move! 

---


And- and oh, Mama - you would of been so proud of me and Ruth and Bennie - we told him to get out! Lord have mercy, we told the man to get out! Oh, we was some proud folks this afternoon, yeah, we were full of that old-time stuff -


---

## RUTH:
You talking 'bout taking them people's money to keep us from moving in our house?


---

## WALTER:
I ain't just talking 'bout it, baby- I'm telling you that's what's going to happen! 


---

## BENEATHA:
Oh God! Where is the bottom! Where is the honest-to-God bottom so he can't go any farther! 


---

## WALTER:
Where is the bottom? Where is the bottom! You and that boy that was here today. You all want everybody to carry a flag and a spear and sing some marching songs, huh? You wanna spend your life looking into things and trying to find the right and the wrong part, huh? Yeah. You know what's going to happen to that boy someday - he'll find himself sitting in a dungeon, locked in forever - and the takers will have the key! Forget it, baby! There ain't no causes - there ain't nothing but taking in this world and he who takes most is the smartest - and it don't make a damn bit of difference how.


---

## MAMA:
You making something inside me cry, son. Some awful pain inside me.


---

## RUTH:
Walter -


---

## WALTER:
Don't cry, Mama. Understand. That white man is going to walk in that door able to write checks for more money than we ever had. It's important to him and I'm going to help him - I'm going to put on the show, Mama.


---

## MAMA:
Son - I come from five generations of people who was slaves and sharecroppers - but ain't nobody in my family never took no money from nobody that was a way of telling us we wasn't fit to walk the earth. We ain't never been that poor. 

---


We ain't never been that – dead inside.


---

## BENEATHA:
Well - we are dead now. All that talk about dreams and sunlight that goes on in this house. It's all dead now.


---

## WALTER:
What's the matter with you all! I didn't make this world! 

---


It was given to me this way! Hell yes, I want me some yachts some day! 

---

Yes, I want to hang some real pearls round my wife's neck! 

---

Ain't she supposed to wear no pearls? Somebody tell me - tell who it is decides which woman is supposed to wear pearls in this world? I tell you I am a man - and I think my wife should wear some pearls in this world.


---

## MAMA:
Baby, how you going to feel on the inside?


---

## WALTER:
Fine! - Going to feel fine - a man -


---

## MAMA:
You won't have nothing left then, Walter Lee.


---

## WALTER:
I'm going to feel fine, Mama. I'm going to look that son-of-a-bitch in the eyes and say – 

---

That's your neighborhood out there! You got the right to keep it like you want! You got the right to have it like you want! Just write the check and - the house is yours. And - and I am going to say – and you - you people just put the money in my hand and you won't have to live next to this bunch of stinking niggers!

---


Maybe - maybe I'll just get down on my black knees -

---


"Captain, Mistuh, Bossman - "

---


"Ah-hee-hee-hee! O, yasssuh, boss! Yasssuh, Great White - Father!"

---


Just gi' ussen de money fo' God's sake and we's - we's ain't gwine out deh 'n' dirty up yo' white folks' neighborhood - "

---


And I'll feel fine! Fine! FINE!


---

## BENEATHA:
That is not a man. That is nothing but a toothless rat.


---

## MAMA:
Yes - death done come in this here house. 

---


Done come walking in my house. On the lips of my children. You what supposed to be my beginning again. You - what supposed to be my harvest. How did we get to this here place? 

---

You mournin’ your brother?

---

## BENEATHA:
He's no brother of mine. 


---

## MAMA:
What you say?


---

## BENEATHA:
I said that that individual in that room is no brother of mine.


---

## MAMA:
That's what I thought you said. You feeling like you better than he is today?

---


Yeah? What you tell him a minute ago? That he wasn't a man? Yeah? You give him up for me? You done wrote his epitaph, too - like the rest of the world? Who give you that privilege?


---

## BENEATHA:
Will you be on my side for once! You saw what he just did, Mama! You saw him - down on his knees. Wasn't it you who taught me to despise any man who would do that? Do what he's going to do?


---

## MAMA:
Yes - I taught you that. Me and your daddy. But I thought I taught you something else, too - I thought I taught you to love him.


---

## BENEATHA:
Love him? There is nothing left to love.


---

## MAMA:
There is always something left to love. And if you ain't learned that you ain't learned nothing. 

---


Have you cried for that boy today? I don't mean for yourself and for the family 'cause we lost the money. 

---

I mean for him; what he been through and what it done to him. Child, when do you think is the time to love somebody the most - when they done good and made things easy for everybody? 

---

Well, that ain't the time at all. It's when he's at his lowest and can't believe in hisself 'cause the world done whipped him so... When you starts measuring somebody - measure him right, child. Measure him right. 

---

Make sure you done taken into account what hills and valleys he come through before he got to wherever he is. 


---

## TRAVIS:
Grandmama - the moving men are downstairs! The truck just pulled up.

## MAMA:
Are they, baby?
They downstairs?

---

A knock on the door.

---

## LINDNER:
Uh - hello –


---

## RUTH:
He's here.


---

## LINDNER:
Well, I certainly was glad to hear from you people.
Life can really be so much simpler than people let it be most of the time.
Well - with whom do I negotiate - you, Mrs. Younger, or your son here?
Just some official papers, sonny.


---

## RUTH:
Travis, you go downstairs -


---

## MAMA:
No! Travis - you stay right here!
And you make him understand what you doing, Walter Lee. You teach him good. Like Willy Harris taught you.


---

## MAMA:
You show where our five generations done come to. Go ahead, son.
Go ahead.


---

## WALTER:
Well, Mr. Lindner

---


We called you – 

---


because, well, me and my family- 

---


well - we are very plain people -


---

## LINDNER:
Well, yes, Mr. Younger...


---

## WALTER:
I mean - I have worked as a chauffeur most of my life - and my wife here, she does domestic work in people's kitchens. So does my mother. I mean - we are plain people.


---

## LINDNER:
Yes, I see, Mr. Younger...


---

## WALTER:
And - uh - well, my father, well - he was a laborer most of his life -


---

## LINDNER:
Yes, yes, I understand ...


---

## WALTER:
And my father- 
My father almost beat a man to death once because this man called him a bad name or something. 

---


You know what I mean?


---

## LINDNER:
No, no, I'm afraid I don't -


---

## WALTER:
Yeah. Well – 
What I mean to say is that we come from people who had a lot of pride. I mean - we are very proud people.
And that's my sister over there - and she's going to be a doctor. And we are very proud.


---

## LINDNER:
Well - I am sure that is very nice, but-


---

## WALTER:
What I am telling you is that we called you over here to tell you that we are very proud and that this – 

---


Travis, come here.

---


This is my son, and he makes the sixth generation of our family in this country - and we have all thought about your offer -


---

## LINDNER:
Well, good... good -


---

## WALTER:
And we have decided to move into our house - because my father - my father - he earned it for us, brick by brick.


---

## WALTER:
We don't want to make no trouble for nobody or fight no causes - and we will try to be good neighbors. And that's all we got to say about that.
We don't want your money.


---

## LINDNER:
I take it then - that you have decided to occupy!?


---

## BENEATHA:
That's what the man said.


---

## LINDNER:
Then I would like to appeal to you, Mrs. Younger. You are older and wiser-


---

## MAMA:
I am afraid you don't understand. My son said we was going to move and there ain't nothin' left for me to say.

---


You know how these young folks is nowadays, Mister. Can't do a thing with 'em!


---

## LINDNER:
But -


---

## MAMA:
Goodbye!


---

## LINDNER:
Well - if you are that final about it. There is nothing left for me to say.
I sure hope you people know what you 're getting into.


---

## RUTH:
Well for God's sake - if the moving men are here -

---


Let's get the hell out of here!


---

## MAMA:
Ain't it the truth. Look at all this here mess. Ruth, put Travis' good jacket on him - Walter Lee, tuck your shirt in - you look like somebody's hoodlum. 

---

Lord, have mercy, where is my plant?

---


Y'all start on down - Travis, child, don't go empty­handed - Ruth, where did I put that box with my skillets? I'm going to make us the biggest dinner we ever ate tonight - Beneatha, what's the matter with them stockings? Pull them things up, girl –


---

## BENEATHA:
Mama, Asagai - asked me to marry him and go to Africa-


---

## MAMA:
He did? You ain't old enough to marry nobody – 

---


Darling, that ain't no bale of cotton; I got to sit in it again! I had that chair twenty-five years -


---

## BENEATHA:
To go to Africa, Mama - be a doctor in Africa-


---

## MAMA:
Yes, baby-


---

## WALTER:
Africa! What he want you to go to Africa for?


---

## BENEATHA:
To practice there -


---

## WALTER:
Girl, if you don't get all them silly ideas out your head. You better marry yourself a man with some loot-


---

## BENEATHA:
What have you got to do with who I marry!


---

## WALTER:
Plenty. Now I think George Murchison -


---

## BENEATHA:
George Murchison! I wouldn't marry him if he was Adam, and I was Eve!


---

## MAMA:
Yeah - they something, alright, my children.


---

## RUTH:
Yeah - they're something. Let's go, Lena.


---

## MAMA:
Yes - I'm coming. Ruth -


---

## RUTH:

## MAMA:

---

## RUTH:
Yes, Lena.


---

## WALTER:
