## POET:

[IN GREEK: RAGE. RAGE. SING THE RAGE OF ACHILLES]

---

µῆνιν ἄειδε θεὰ Πηληϊάδεω Ἀχιλῆος
MEH nin ah | EI de the | A PEH | LEH ia | DYO akhi | LEH os

---

οὐλοµένην, ἣ µυρί' Ἀχαιοῖς ἄλγε' ἔθηκε
OU lo me | NEHN HEH | MU ria | KHAI OIS | AL ge’eh | THEH ke

---

ολλὰς δ'ἰφθίµους ψυχὰς Ἄϊδι προΐαψεν
PO LLAS | D’IPH THI | MOUS PSU | KHAS ah i | DI pro i | AH

---

psen ἡρώων, HEH RO | ON—

---

Back then, oh I could sing it. For days and nights.

---

On and on, every battle, every old digression, I would sing and sing… 

---

in Mycenae once I sang for a year – you don’t believe me? 

---

In Babylon, I sang it differently, but the crowds came… 

---

in Alexandria I started to notice a few empty seats, but still I sang it.

---

Shorter though - 3 or 4 days… you know where it went down really well? 

---

Gaul, something about those people, they had a real taste for it—of course they were hard to control, 

---

they used to get up on tables and sing along, 

---

they threatened to take the whole thing over, went outside, screaming, building fires, terrible.

---

Every time I sing this song, I hope it’s the last time.

---


Oh, sing to me now.

---

Uhhh, you muses. In the halls of Olympus… you are goddesses!

---

You are everywhere! You know everything!

---

All we hear is the distant ring of glory… sing…

---

You know, in the old days, we’d be in a tavern, or a bar, I guess you would say. 

---

It was so much easier to talk about these horrors in a bar… 

---

This is the story of the Trojan War.

---

And two great fighters – Achilles and Hector.

---


Muses… (he sings)

---

May-nin Eye-ay-duh The-ah

Pelay eye-dyaw'Ah-xee-lay-ahws oo-low-may-nin…

---

RAGE! 

---

Goddess, sing the rage of Peleus’ son Achilles,

---

murderous, doomed, that cost the Achaeans countless losses, 

---

hurling down to the House of Death so many sturdy souls, 

---

great fighters’ souls, but made their bodies carrion,
feasts for the dogs and birds…

---

What drove them to fight with such a fury?

---

Ohhhh… the gods, of course… um… pride, honor, jealousy… Aphrodite… some game or other, an apple, Helen being more beautiful than somebody 

---

– it doesn’t matter. The point is, Helen’s been stolen, and the Greeks have to get her back.

---

Huhhh. It’s always something, isn’t it?

---

But- it’s a good story. I - I remember a lot of it, I remember a lot of it…

---

Imagine a beach – rocky, jagged – and oh about a mile and a half inland imagine a city, with stone ramparts protecting it.

---

This city was called Troy, and from the walls of this city Hector can see the water, down by the beach, and in that water, there are hundreds of ships. It is crowded with all kinds of Greek ships.

---

This is where my story takes place. Ages ago.

---

Who were the captains of those Greek ships? Who were the captains of Achaea?

---

Ahhhhh! The mass of troops I could never tally, I could, I could, if… if I had ten tongues in ten mouths… if, if, if, if I, if I had a heart made of me bronze, Yes!

---

A heart made of inside me bronze. And if I could remember the names, that is- if I could actually remember everybody.

---

Sing! Sing in memory
all who gathered under Troy…	
the list of ships…

The numbers of men on those ships… Muses?

---

Here goes:	

---

First came the Boeotian units led by Lay-i-tus and Pen-e-lay-os:

---

Ar-se-si-lay-us and Proth-o-ee-nor and Clonius shared command of the armed men who lived in Hyria, rocky Aulis,

---

Thespia and Gray-uh, the dancing rings of My-ka-less-us,

---

men who lived round Harma, Il-e-si-on and Er-y-three

---

Co-pae, Eu-tree-sis and Thisbe thronged with doves,

---

Ah, it’s coming back to me, yes fighters from Coronea, Haliartus deep in meadows,

---

and the men who held Plataea and lived in Glisas,

---

men who held the rough-hewn gates of Lower Thebes,

---

On-kee-stus the holy, Poseidon’s sun-filled grove,

---

men from the town of Arne green with vineyards…

---

Ah, that’s right, you don’t know any of these places… 

---

but (sigh), these names - these names mean something to me. 

---

And I knew these boys…

---

The point is, on all these ships, are boys from every small town in Ohio, from farmlands, from fishing villages…

---

The boys of Nebraska and South Dakota… the twangy boys of Memphis… the boys of San Diego, Palo Alto, Berkeley, Antelope Valley… You can imagine, you can imagine, you know, um… there are soldiers from Kansas.

---

There are soldiers from Lawrence, Kansas. There are soldiers from Springfield, Illinois.

---

Evanston, Illinois; Chicago, Illinois; Buffalo, New York; Cooperstown, New York; Brooklyn; Queens; Staten Island; uh, the Bronx; South Bronx. You have soldiers from Florida, from the Panhandle, with its snake charmers and evangelists, from the Okeechobee.

---

You have soldiers from Miami who speak Spanish, Miami who speak French, Miami who speak English. You have Puerto Rican soldiers.

---

You have soldiers from Texas, from the flatland, from Dallas, from Plano, from Houston. There are soldiers from Tennessee, from western Tennessee, from the mountains, from the mountains in Virginia, the mountains in Seattle.

---

From Flint, Michigan, from Benton Harbor, from- from- from- in the thumb, from Escanaba, you know what I mean? …that’s it.

---

That’s it. 
You get the point.

---

Known and unknown. 

---

We’re talking tens of thousands of men, emptied out of the Greek islands,

---

Picture these men, these ships, so many ships.50, 40, 40, 40, 50, 80, 100 (Agamemnon), 60, 40, 40, 12 (Odysseus),
80, 30, 50 (Achilles), 11, 40, 30, - these are ships I’m counting, not men - 40, 40, 90 (Nestor) …that’s, how many, uhhhhh, hundreds and hundreds of ships.

---

That’s 120 men on each ship …tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of Greek men. 
Do you see?

---

So here we are - Nine years. 

---

Oh please… O Muses… don’t make me do this alone. Nine years.

---

Fighting on and off, fighting to the wall and back. Greeks win one day, Trojans win the next, like a game of tug-of-war, and nothing to show for it but exhaustion, poverty, and loneliness. What was it like?

---

Ah, it was a pain. It was awful.

---

It was, it was, it was hot. How about that?

---

It was hot. How can I – ?

---

Nine years. So for- so you left home when your baby was one, you come back and your baby is ten.

---

You left your baby was one, you come back your baby is dead. You come back and your - your wife is dead.

---

You come back your wife is fat. You come back your wife has had three affairs and two more kids.

---

––Uh, hi honey, y-uhhhhh, don’t get mad, don’t get mad. You know, or you come back, and the farm is ruined.

---

Or there’s been a war and you’re no longer Greek. You’re now Diocletian or whatever it is - you’re Spartan now.

---

They came and took over, while you were hanging out at Troy, and you have no title to your land anymore. Um, your father died while you were gone.

---

You know, oh no (gasp) we don’t wear those leggings anymore, we stopped wearing them like that a long time ago…

---

And so, you can imagine, after 9 years of this, well, they want to go home. They've forgotten why they're fighting.

---

—but what humiliation it would be	
to hold out so long, then sail home empty handed. 

---

How do you know when you’ve won? You know, someone said, uh how do you ask uh a person to be the last man to die for a, for a- a losing cause and I, I’m paraphrasing but the idea being, you’re in the supermarket line, and you’ve been there for 20 minutes and the other line’s moving faster.

---

Do you switch lines now? No, goddamn it, I’ve been here for 20 minutes, I’m gonna wait in this line, I don’t care if I wait.

---

And look- I’m not leaving cuz otherwise I’ve wasted my time. 
Courage, my friends, hold out a little longer…
---

## POET:
Now this whole time, of course, the Gods were watching.

---

Up on Mount Olympus. And some of them cheered on the Greeks— “Achilles!” and some of them cheered on the Trojans—“Hector!” Like sports fans.

---

And really, back then, this was their only entertainment, they were addicted to it, they couldn’t allow it to end, and so they’d swoop down and pinch and prod and whisper, just to make sure the battles kept raging. Ah, the old gods.

---

You remember Zeus? And his wife, Hera?

---

Apollo? Athena?

---

Well, they haven’t been around.

---

Where do the old gods go?

---

That’s a song. Where do the old gods go when they die?

---

I don’t know. (giggling) 

---

Gods never die.

---

They change. They, they, they burrow inside us….

---

They become us, they become our impulses. 
Lust?

---

Aphrodite. Mischief?

---

Hermes. A good idea?

---

Athena…

---

Oh, the things the gods could do to us. 
(Distant music.)

---

Nine years in.

---

And we’re all camped out on that beach. Bad enough.

---

Only now it’s night and men are suddenly getting very sick. One minute they’re polishing their boots, the next they’re choking on black blood.

---

Down the beach, there's a massive fire burning, and the fire is not wood, it's corpses, they’re burning the corpses of men and mules and dogs, they've all been infected by plague. What is going on??

---


I’ll tell you: we’ve angered the gods. Agamemnon, our leader, our commander has taken as the spoils of war this girl –gorgeous, 15 yrs old – and she happens to be the daughter of a priest, a priest of Apollo.

---

The old man comes to Agamemnon with a cart piled high: "Please take these gifts, this ransom. Just give me back my daughter."

Agamemnon says no.

---

The priest offers to pray for the Greeks if only he'll give him his daughter back. Agamemnon says no.

---

All of the Greek commanders come back to Agamemnon and they beg him to give her back. Agamemnon says no.

---

The priest is heartsick, he goes to Apollo and Apollo gets mad. Ever seen an angry god?

---

Apollo takes these arrows, and he covers the tips in sickness, in plague. Nasty stuff.

---

The arrows clanged at his back as the god quaked with rage, Over against the ships he dropped to a knee, let fly a shaft And a terrifying clash rang out from the great silver bow –

---

(TUNG!) Infection. (TUNG!) Disease.

---

(TUNG!) Death. There’s only one way to end the plague: Agamemnon has to give the girl back.

---

## AGAMEMNON:

I won’t give up the girl! 

---

## POET:

He’s the commander, no one’s going to tell him what to do.

---

So the Greeks call a grand assembly. Allll the tribes, allll the factions, allll the warriors gather and the meeting grounds shook,

---

everybody buzzing like, like bees, you know?

---

They're angry and frightened and sick of the plague–and Agamemnon sweeps in. All the men shout, "Respect the priest!

---

Take the ransom! Give her back!" Somebody yells, "Quiet, quiet, quiet!

---

The King of Men, Agamemnon is speaking!"

---

Silence. 

---

Agamemnon grabs the scepter and rises:

---

## AGAMEMNON:
Ok – I'm willing to give her back, if that's what you all want.

---

I'm not a tyrant. I can see that it's best for everyone if I do.

---


But fetch me another prize - and straight off too - else I alone of the Argives go without my honor. That would be a disgrace.

---

And the men all kind of murmur cause there are no prizes left, they've all been distributed – someone will have to give up their prize – and suddenly a huge figure rises in the back – AH! This is our man – Achilles.

---

In the middle of all this – misery – there is this one genious. 
Achilles… is the greatest warrior that ever lived - bigger than Heracles, bigger than Sinbad, bigger than… well, who’s the greatest warrior living now…?

---

And he’s not just good at killing. It’s that he’s good at the art of war.

---

Now—you have to understand that
Achilles is superhuman. He’s, uh, half mortal, but also half god.

---

His mother Thetis is a sea-nymph, he was raised by a centaur and, you know, amazing things, like his, his, he could talk to, he could understand animals. Animals talked to him.

---

His horse —  can't remember the horse's name — talked to him. I remember wuh, once, once his horse sat him down.

---

His horse said – no, no, one day, Achilles was, he was, he was uh, he was really… he was over-eating, and his horse said (neighing), “Whoa-oa-oa-oa!” (laughs)… We all laughed. 
Oh yes… and Achilles knows he’s going to die - here, in Troy.

---

He doesn’t know when, he doesn’t know how, but he knows he won’t be going home. That’s been prophesied.

---

Achilles will have a brief but glorious life. Imagine living with that.

---

This is Achilles. Here he is.

---

## ACHILLES:

Just how, Agamemnon,	
Great field marshal… most grasping man alive,
How can the generous Argives give you prizes now? I know of no troves of treasure, piled, lying idle, anywhere.

---

Whatever we dragged from towns we plundered, all’s been portioned out. But collect it, call it back from the rank and file?

---

That would be the disgrace – and oh – he shouldn’t have said that, the men start to shrink back now, leaving Achilles alone to face the commander-in-chief. 

---

## AGAMEMNON:
You can’t talk to me like that, even if you are the bravest fighter we have.

---

You’re so gifted. You’re such a great warrior.

---

But don’t forget you’re half god. I’m only a man, but I’ll show you who’s greater.

---


What do you want? To cling to your own prize while I sit calmly by, empty-handed here?

---

I’ll take what I want – Give me Briseius!

---

## POET:
Now Briseius is someone that Achilles won, fair and square. Not only has he won her, he's come to love her.

---

Briseius is his companion
- she cooks for him, she sleeps with him, she's, she's become dear to him
---

## ACHILLES:
Don’t give me commands! 
The Trojans never did me damage, not in the least.

---

No, you colossal, shameless—we all followed you, to please you, to fight for you, to win your honor back from the Trojans – Menelaus and you, you dog-face! 

---

## POET:
The men all gasp!

---

## ACHILLES:
Never once did you arm with the troops and go to battle or risk an ambush– You lack the courage, you can see the death coming. Safer by far, you find, to foray all through camp,Commandeering the prize of any man who speaks against you.

---

King who devours his people! I have no mind to linger here, disgraced, Brimming your cup and piling up your plunder!

---

## POET:
He starts to leave–

---

## AGAMEMNON:
Desert, by all means – if the spirit drives you home! 
I will never beg you to stay, not on my account.

---

But let this be my warning on your way:
I will be there in person at your tents
To take Briseis in all her beauty, your own prize – So you can learn just how much greater I am than you! And the next man up may shrink from matching words with me!

---

## POET:
And Achilles flies into a rage:

---

He grabs the scepter -- now this scepter is, is, a Greek tradition, whenever anybody wants to speak officially we take the scepter – 

---

it’s like a talking stick, the origins of democratic process and all of that -- and Achilles says:

---

 "By this scepter, this mighty oak, that will never again flower, I swear, I will never fight again! 

---

Let all the Greeks die, let all the men be swept, not until, and, and let you, Agamemnon come on your knees to me, repentant, blubbering, 

---

wishing you had never said these words, you can eat your heart out, you can eat your words, I will never fight for you again.

---

Trojan Hector will slaughter you all, you dare to humiliate, humiliate me? 
---

## POET:

He raises his arm against Agamemnon.

---

All the men are staring at him. What is he doing?

---

And suddenly… his head yanks back. The men can’t see what Achilles can see: Athena has grabbed him by the hair, she whispers in his ear, “Hold back.

---

You can’t kill Agamemenon” And Achilles says, “Why?” And she says, “Obey.”

---

Achilles has no choice. He takes the scepter and he BSHHHH to the ground, smashes it in pieces – not really, but - Furious!

---

“None of you in this meeting will speak for me? See how you do without me.” And he storms out!

---

And all the Greek army is standing there going (awed look), and Agamemnon’s kinda going (confused grumble), ––“Who the fuck cares about him?” And he leaves. This is the rage of Peleus’ son, Achilles. 

---

May-nin Eye-ay-duh The-ah Pelay eye-dyaw'Ah-xee-lay-ahws.

---

And there it is. That’s how it starts, it’s so… It’s infuriating…

---

They take the girl to Agamemnon’s tent…

---

And Achilles wept, and slipping away from his companions, far apart, sat down on the beach of the heaving gray sea and scanned the endless ocean.

---

So... the war rages on, but Achilles stays in his tent.

---

Waiting, fuming, betting against his own side, the Greeks

---

I wish I could show you a photograph of Troy. But here is what it was like:

---

Walk through the Scaean Gates and the first thing you’ll see is a great plaza, a great plaza with a fountain, there’s water everywhere: little waterfalls, little pools, every house has its own pool, and you hear the sound of water flowing all the time, and the water is a form of music, and that music mingles with real music: flutes, lyres, singing.

---

And then as you walk through, you begin to see how every house is both private and public so every house has a private area and yet it spills into a common area, so as you’re walking through the city of Troy you see everybody, and everybody sees you.

---

 They’ll often have events, they like to have their concerts, they have public meetings, they have performances of all kinds and there’s a great sense of civic duty, so they get together to discuss things like: what do we do with the fig tree that’s dying?

---

How do we save the fig tree? And they have a committee to talk about the fig tree.

---

And of course, respect for the family, the royal family, Priam and his sons. They’ve actually brought Troy peace, they’ve actuallyfought off invasions, they’ve actually given them a life that’s stable.

---

So what you feel when you walk into Troy is a great sense of calm and a great sense of serenity… this is before the war, of course. 
Now the man named Hector.

---

Shining Hector. Man-killing Hector.

---

Hektoros hippodamoio. Hector breaker of horses– it’s always so hard to describe Hector –

---

His little brother calls him a ‘sharp ax’ – a sharp edge, always cleaving forward…

---

Hector believes in -- he believes in institutions, he believes in - in country, he believes in his family, he believes in the army.

---

Isn’t it funny how hard it is to describe a good man? 

---

Hector is a brave man but deep down, he’d rather be taming horses.

---

But Hector is the eldest – first born and he’s got DOZENS, and I mean DOZENS of brothers and sisters, more than 50, by various mothers, I can’t remember all their names now- my God- I would have to look that up, it’s all written down somewhere… 

---

But one brother especially – Paris – every time Hector sees Paris he can’t seem to stop yelling at him. And for good reason, of course, because Paris was the kind of - Paris actually figured out a way to make the case that it was better for him to stay inside, with the women, then go out and fight.

---

And even when he did try to fight once, Aphrodite swooped in and picked him up by the scruff of his neck, wrapped him in a blanket made of fog, and tossed him back in Helen’s bed. And he stayed there.

---

That’s who Paris was. It, it was something like you know, ––“Ohhh, but if I go, and if they catch me, you know they will hold me for ransom and then you’ll be put in an awkward position.

---

Better for me to stay here and, and, you know, live out my days knowing that I am a coward and…” You know you couldn’t argue with someone like that because he actually made the case for you and you were like… uhh… you are a coward, you know what I mean? But he had already called himself a coward- where are you going to go from there?

---

Everyone always wants to hear more about Paris “Paris! Paris!

---

Tell us more about Paris!” But actually, Paris isn’t really that important – I know, I know, he stole Helen away from Menelaus and brought her to Troy and that started the war, and yes, he was so handsome and everything – but he’s not interesting. Not interesting to me.

---

Anymore. 

---

But Hector.

---

You know the thing about Hector is: He’s proud. He won’t let anyone else lead the charge for Troy.

---

They’ve got allies, come in from all over, but Hector won’t let them lead their own tribes. He wants to be in charge.

---

Complicated. Full of hubris, but also decent.

---

Hector’s a good husband, and a good father. He’s a lot like… 

---

One terrible day – the Trojans are struggling – because the Greek army is full of ferocious warriors – Great Ajax, Diomedes – and even though Achilles won’t fight, the Greeks are winning because Athena… oh, the gods have made a mess of things, you wouldn’t believe all the… Athena even puts on her helmet and fights for the Greeks, stabbing her own brother Ares in the stomach, and he goes crying to Zeus - no, no, it’s a mess… On this day the Greeks, with the help of Athena, they hack and chop and decimate the Trojans, pushing them back toward the city walls.

---

Hector and his brothers try to hold their ground but they keep getting pushed back, pushed back, and Hector becomes afraid that the Trojan soldiers might give up and run away, or hide inside the city gates. Hector and one of his brothers – uh… – realize that they have to get Athena on their side.

---

So Hector runs alone back toward Troy to ask the citizens to pray to Athena. 

---

His mother, Hecuba, catches sight of him and runs and grabs his hand.
---

## HECUBA:


My child—why have you left the bitter fighting,	 why have you come home? Look how they wear you out… But wait, I’ll bring you some honeyed, mellow wine.

---

When a man’s exhausted, wine will build his strength 

---

## HECTOR:
Don’t offer me mellow wine, mother, not now – you’d sap my limbs, I’d lose my nerve for war. No- pray to the Gods – ask Athena to stop helping the Greeks.

---

## POET:

And he runs on. Then the “face that launched a thousand ships,” Helen-- she stops him:

---

## HELEN:

My dear brother, dear to me, bitch that I am, vicious, scheming – horror to freeze the heart!

---

Oh how I wish
that first day my mother brought me into the light
some black whirlwind had rushed me out to the mountains! But since the gods ordained it all, these desperate years, I wish I had been the wife of a better man.

---

But come in, rest on this seat with me, dear brother. You are the one hit hardest by the fighting, Hector, you more than all – and all for me, whore that I am, and this blind mad Paris. Oh the two of us!

---

## POET

But Hector doesn’t have time for this, the only one he wants to see is his wife, Andromache, and his son, Astyanax, who’s just, oh, maybe 6 months old… he goes to his house and they’re not there, he looks for them everywhere, he can’t find them, he’s starting to panic, then someone tells him they’re up on the tower, on the walls of the city, and he runs up there, helmet flashing - still in his full armor. There they are, his wife Andromache, and his baby boy.

---

Hector smiles – that’s a rare thing. 

---

## ANDROMACHE:


Oh Hector.

---

Why are you just staring at us? Can’t you speak?

---

What are you doing home in the middle of the day? Is the war over?

---

## HECTOR:

No. 

It’s a bad day for us.

---

I’ve come home to start the prayers. 

---

## ANDROMACHE:

Oh.

---

Hector – please listen to me. You’re all I have – Achilles killed my mother, my father, my brothers.

---

Now I have only you – and our child. I’m begging you – stay on the ramparts.

---

Why can’t you draw your army up by that fig tree down there, where the gate is weakest – you know they’ve attacked us 3 times on that very spot where the wall is low.

## HECTOR

But that would make me look like a coward. I can’t retreat – even though every night I wake in a sweat, dreaming of you widowed, enslaved, and the boy –

---

## POET:

Hector reaches for the baby – but Astyanax suddenly wails – WAHHHH!

---

## HECTOR:

What? What did I do??

---

## ANDROMACHE:

It’s your helmet! Take it off!

---

Take it off!! 

---

## HECTOR:

 No, no, no, don’t be afraid – that’s only Daddy’s helmet!Here - someday you’ll wear a helmet like this.

---

Someday you’ll be an even greater soldier than your father. You’ll ride a big horse, a dark one, just like mine.

---

You’ll fly on that horse, through the air! You’ll come home wearing the bloody gear of the mortal enemy you’ve killed in battle –

---

## ANDROMACHE:

That’s enough!

---

Reckless one, Hector — your fiery courage will destroy you. Have you no pity for him, our helpless son?

---

Or me, and the destiny that weighs me down, your widow, now so soon –

---

## HECTOR:

Andromache, why so desperate? 
No man will hurl me down to Death, against my fate.

---

And fate? No one alive has ever escaped it, neither brave man nor coward, I tell you— it’s born with us the day that we are born.

## ANDROMACHE

Oh Hector, but if you stay home --

---

## HECTOR:

I have to go.

---

Give me a kiss. Now go home, love.

---

Don’t cry. Pray.

---

## POET:

Hector puts on his heavy helmet and goes back to the front lines. 

---

Huh.

---

Have you ever seen a front line? Let’s take – I want to show you what that bloody field looked like, what Hector walked back to just then, with all those other boys scattered across it.

---

It’s like, it’s like – I have a picture here it’s from another war but— oh, I can’t – 

---

well here - you see, outside the trenches where there had been a particularly bad day – this was oh a hundred years ago but you get the picture- and uhhh the battlefield was just littered with bodies and when you look at it you think, –– Oh, well these are a bunch of bodies but they’re not just bodies cuz this is this is Jamie and this is Matthew and this is Brennan and this is Paul, this is Scottie he was 19, he was 21, he was 18, Brennan was meant to go to Oxford – he had gotten a scholarship because of his writing – his father was only a postman he would have been the first child in his whole family ever to go to University -- but he didn’t…

---

Do you see? 

---

But this is the battle I want to tell you about now: because the women of Troy prayed, and those prayers seemed to work, and the Trojans begin to fight like never before – and still no Achilles, and that begins to take its toll on the Greeks.

---

This is what the war looks like:

---

(Music begins.)

---

At last the armies clashed at one strategic point, they slammed their shields together, pike scraped pikewith the grappling strength of fighters armed in bronze and their round shields pounded, boss on welded boss, and the sound of struggle roared and rocked the earth. 

---

Screams of men and cries of triumph breaking in one breath, fighters killing, fighters killed, and the ground streamed blood.

---

Wildly as two winter torrents raging down from the mountains, swirling into a valley, hurl their great waters together, plunging down in a gorge and miles away in the hills a shepherd hears the thunder — so from the grinding armies broke the cries and crash of war. 
---

## POET:

…and Terror and Rout and relentless Strife stormed too, sister of manslaughtering Ares, Ares’ comrade-in-arms— Strife, only a slight thing when she first rears her head
but her head soon hits the sky as she strides across the earth.

---

Now Strife hurled down the leveler Hate amidst both sides, wading into the onslaught, flooding men with pain.

---

I never could come up with the right uh… epithet for Patroclus. Son of Menoetius.

---

Horseman. 

---

You know what I should call him, I suppose:

---

Friend.

---

Patroclus was Achilles’ friend. His only friend.

---

They were boyhood friends. Patroclus was sent by his own father to live with Achilles’ family – he’s slightly older than Achilles, good with horses, and practical.

---

His father said to Patroclus: ‘It’s your duty to take care of Achilles. You’re wiser than he is.

---

Counsel him and he’ll listen to you.’ And so Patroclus and Achilles were more than friends, they were brothers. And really they were more than brothers, they loved each other.

---

When Achilles couldn’t sleep, Patroclus would hold him – that kind of thing. Friends.

---

Now Patroclus was a good fighter, but when Achilles retreats to his tent, Patroclus stops fighting too. There’s no question, his first allegiance is to his friend.

---

But on this day, this day when Trojans are slaughtering Greeks left and right, and the Trojans have gotten past the Greek ramparts, they’ve crashed through all the Greek defenses, and Patroclus has been running up and down the beach, watching the bodies carried – but there’s nowhere to carry them – and he sees that Agamemnon is wounded, and Odysseus is wounded, and the one medic is wounded, and he can’t take it anymore. He runs to Achilles tent:

---

## PATROCLUS:

Don’t be mad at me – but your anger is making you blind.

---

Can’t you see that Hector is destroying us? Is your heart made of iron?

---

If you won’t fight, drive the Trojans back, then let me. Give me your armor – they might think I’m you. I’ll take that chance – but you are wrong, you will be remembered as a fool, if you won’t fight this day.

---

## ACHILLES:

But I swore. 

---

I won’t break my word, I won’t fight for Agamemnon, I won’t fight even if the Trojans sweep into my own tent.

---

It’s not even my anger now, it’s the thought of breaking my word. I CAN’T DO IT!!!

---

But you – that’s a good idea. You fight in my place.

---

The whole city of Troy comes trampling down on us, daring, wild—why? They cannot see the brow of my helmet flash before their eyes—

---

If you put on my armor… they’ll think I’m back… just the thought I’m back in the battle, will send them running in terror.

---

Here, take it, my breastplate, my greaves, my helmet -- but promise me this – you must only fight until you drive the Trojans back fromour ramparts. And no further.

---

Do not push close to the Trojan walls – not without me. 
---

## PATROCLUS:

I promise.

---

## POET:

Can you see it, can you? 

---

The young Patroclus – I can’t help it, I always see him as young, too small for Achilles’ armor, so that, you know, he’s kind of knocking around inside it…

---

Patroclus O my rider, straight at the pressing Trojan ranks you swooped…

---

And at first he does as he’s promised – the sight of Achilles’ armor terrifies the Trojan fighters, they lose their nerve, and Patroclus drives them back from the Argive ships, and then further, and further. He’s good at this, Patroclus, he never knew he was so good at it – he’s gifted, he breathes in the smell of blood and bronze, he’s been waiting NINE YEARS to show what he’s made of, and here he is wearing Achilles armor and he feels GOOD, ya know?

---

You know that feeling when, for whatever reason, you could kill somebody? Right then and there.

---

You could kill them. You could tear their fucking head off.

---

You could rend them limb from limb. The guy in front of you who cuts you off, you could ram him with your car, you don’t care about the result- just ram him!

---

And you could see the charred metal and you could see the see the smoking thing and you could see the air bag and you hope the air bag smothers him. And if it doesn’t, you’ll get out and you’ll go, “You fucking idiot!

---

Why did you fucking cut me off?!” AAAARRRRRGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!! 
Glint of a spear tore his opponent’s chest, stabbed his right jawbone, ramming the spearhead square between his teeth so hard – hoisted, dragged the Trojan – fury bursting his heart - mouth gaping - flipped him down facefirst, dead as he fell –

---

Ha! Ha! 

---

Lunging in -- he flung a rock struck between his eyes crushed both brows, the skull caved in
and both eyes burst from their sockets, NOTHING can hurt Patroclus now, he’s a killing MACHINE, my god --

---

Patroclus like something superhuman – Patroclus and his men - Hungry as wolves that rend and bolt raw flesh, hearts filled with battle-frenzy that never dies— they gorge on the kill till all their jaws drip red with blood, belching bloody meat, but the fury, never shaken, builds inside their chests though their glutted bellies burst –

---

It’s a BLUR OF KILLS!!

---

One man – SLASHED! another – GORED!

---

another – HAMMERED! another – SPLINTERED!

---

– SINEWS SHREDDED! – BRONZE RIPPING!

---

One guy – CRACKED THROUGH THE BONY SOCKET! then – WRENCHED THE WHOLE ARM OUT!!

---

IMPALED!! (MORE) WHIPPED!!

---

(MORE) STABBED!! (MORE) CHOPPED!!

---

SNAPPED!! HEWED!!

---

SMASHED!!HACKED!! 

---

WHOLE EARTH RAN HOT WITH BLOOD BLOOD BLOOD
And RED DEATH!!

---

AND IT FEELS GOOD!!!!!!! 

---

(He pants.)

---

Oh god.

---

I’m sorry…

---

I’m sorry, that’s not –

---

Sometimes it just –

---

This is why I don’t do this. This is why I don’t do this.

---

So Patroclus crowded corpse on corpse on the earth that rears us all. And then… in the middle of it all - impossibly, like I have never quite understood what happened… his helmet falls off, his armor falls off, he- suddenly gets shoved to the ground like some massive force hit him, something hit him.

---

His helmet didn’t fit anyway. The armor didn’t fit anyway.

---

I mean, like to even put it on he had to stuff rags in his head and rags in his chest to keep the thing on. It’s not his armor, it’s Achilles’ armor.

---

Achilles has like 400 pounds on him, or whatever it is. 

---

So Patroclus, you know after all the struggling, has lost his helmet, he’s lost his armor.

---

I mean at the time, you know what some people said was that Apollo knocked it off him. Apollo was on Hector’s side.

---

And that Apollo, went like this: (Click with wink)

---

Came up behind him and just went, (Click with wink)

---

With his little finger and his helmet, ––“Chhh. 
And Apollo kind of went, (exhale)

---

And the straps broke on the breastplate.

---

And it fell off. And so Patroclus stands up and goes, “(Gasp).” Totally exposed.

---

And out of nowhere comes this Dardan, this guy… a nobody- never fought before- first day of fighting, done very very well, ya know, running around, I think he has killed nine people so far, he’s knocked five chariot riders off their – uh - things. Takes his spear and literally, happens to be behind Patroclus and just kind of goes, “Uhhh.”

---

Right through him.

---

And Patroclus, like he doesn’t even feel it, just kind of goes… and sees this kid, this Dardan. The Dardan takes his spear pulls it back out, and runs away.

---

Then, Patroclus, the end of life came blazing up before you –Hector. 

---

Hector sees Achilles armor and Hector makes his move.

---

He comes running at him, from, I don’t know how far away, but he gets up ahead of steam. Comes running at him, running at him, running at him.

---

He takes his spear and, how did it work? What we say is that it went up his bowels – and the brazen point went jutting straight out through Patroclus’ back.

---

It’s a bad way to go. Patroclus crashes to the ground.

---

And then Hector begins to RAGE:

---

## HECTOR:

Patroclus--	surely you must have thought you’d storm my city down, you’d wrest from the wives of Troy their day of freedom, you fool! The vultures will eat your body raw!

---

Not for all his power could Achilles save you now— and how he must have filled your ears with orders—you maniac, you obeyed!! 

--

And then Patroclus - holding his body together with his hands - Patroclus curses Hector.

---

## PATROCLUS:


…you won’t live long yourself, I swear. 
Already I see them looming up beside you—death
and the strong force of fate, to bring you down—

---

## POET:

Death cut him short.

---

The end closed in around him. Flying free of his limbs his soul went winging down to the House of Death.

---

But Hector can’t stop yelling at Patroclus, even though he’s dead:

## HECTOR

You think you know my fate?? Why should I fear Death?

---

No. Death is on my side.

---

He is my brother. And together we will devastate you, we will murder all Greeks!!

---

## POET:

With that he planted a heel against Patroclus’ chest, wrenched his brazen spear from the wound, kicked him over, flat on his back, and then he tears the rest of Achilles’ armor off the dead body, savagely, awkwardly, crying out like an animal. 

---

Hector is… a good guy, an honorable man.

---

But at that moment – well…. 

---

Yes.

---

That’s how it happens. We think of ourselves: not me, I’m not like that, I’m a peaceful –but it happens anyway, some trick in our blood and –

(a fierce whisper)

Rage. Do you see?

---

A black cloud of grief came shrouding over Achilles. Overpowered in all his power, sprawled in the dust, Achilles suddenly loosed a terrible, wrenching cry, and his noble mother heard him…

---

Here is what Achilles says to his mother:

---

## ACHILLES

He’s dead.

---

And I sent him out there. It should have been me.

---

What do I do now? 

---

If only strife could die from the lives of gods and men	and anger that drives the sanest man to flare in outrage – bitter gall, sweeter than dripping streams of honey, that swarms in people’s chests and blinds like smoke – just like the anger Agamemnon king of men has roused within me now… 

---

Enough. Let bygones be bygones.

---

Done is done. 

---

Now I’ll go and meet that murderer head-on,
that Hector who destroyed the dearest life I know.

## THETIS:

Wait – you have no armor, Hector wears your armor now. Sit here, wait.

---

## POET:

His mother runs to Hephaestus, the crippled god of fire, and asks him to make new armor for Achilles. 

---

Hepaeustus flicks his hand and tripods swing into place and he waves his hand again and 20 bellows begin pumping and blowing on the fires and the coals start to glow white hot.

---

Again and again he waves his hands and tin, bronze, gold, silver fly through the air, plunging into cauldrons, to be melted down for Achilles - a breastplate, greaves for his legs, a helmet made of bronze and a shield - the most magnificent shield I’ve ever seen. 

---

This is Achilles’ new shield and it gleamed with a, with a beam that it- it- it went so far.

---

It was as if you were- you were, you were far out at sea, you know, a sailor when they have to look out at the shore and try to find their bearings and they look for a light and, and we have lighthouses now – but then, sometimes, you would have, like a - one guy on a mountain, herding his sheep and he would have a very strong light, you know, to try to… keep the sailors, sailors safe, and… and they’re way out at sea, and this light beam comes flying out. 

---

That’s how Achilles’ shield looked from a distance.

---

It- it- it just bounced the light back, shot it way out like that. (Wind quickly grows)

---

Achilles… dashed toward the city, heart racing… rushing on like a champion stallion drawing a chariot full tilt, sweeping across the plain in easy, tearing strides – so Achilles hurtled on, driving legs and knees.

---

And Hector was first to see him coming, surging over the plain, blazing like a star. 
And I don’t have to tell you, do I?

---

– the tide has turned, of course, because Achilles is back in the game. The Greeks are winning, raging, driving the Trojans back inside their own walls.

---

But there stood Hector,	shackled fast by his deadly fate, holding his ground, exposed in front of Troy and the Scaean Gates. 
This is what he looks like.

---

And this is what he’s thinking:

---

## HECTOR:

No way out. If I slip inside the gates and walls… Now my army’s ruined… I would die of shame to face the men of Troy and the Trojan women trailing their long robes…

---

So now, better by far for me to stand up to Achilles, kill him, come home alive or die at his hands in glory out before the walls.

---

## POET

And then he stops – listen:

## HECTOR

But wait – what if I put down my studded shield and heavy helmet, prop my spear on the rampart and go forth, just as I am, to meet Achilles… why, I could promise to give back Helen, yes, and all her treasures with her, all those riches
Paris once hauled home to Troy in the hollow ships – and they were the cause of all our endless fighting –

## POET

And that’s what we’ve all been thinking, isn’t it? Isn’t it?

---

JUST GIVE HER BACK!!!! 

## HECTOR

Yes, yes, return it all to the sons of Atreus now to haul away, and then, at the same time, divide the rest with all the Argives, all the city holds, and then I’d take an oath for the Trojan royal council that we will hide nothing!

---

Share and share alike the hoards our handsome citadel stores within its depths and –

---

Why debate, my friend? Why thrash things out?

---

No way to parley with that man – not now –
not from behind some oak or rock to whisper, like a boy and a young girl, lovers’ secrets
a boy and girl might whisper to each other… Better to clash in battle, now, at once –

## POET

So he wavered, waiting there, but Achilles was closing on him now like the god of war, the fighter’s helmet flashing, over his right shoulder shaking the Pelian ash spear,
that terror, and the bronze around his body flared like a raging fire or the rising, blazing sun. 

---

Hector looked up, saw him, started to tremble, gone, he could hold his ground no longer, he left the gates behind and away he fled in fear – so Achilles flew at him, breakneck on in fury with Hector fleeing along the walls of Troy,
fast as his legs would go.

---

One escaping, one in pursuit and the one who fled was great but the one pursuing greater, even greater – their pace mounting in speed Like powerful stallions – so the two of them whirled three times around the city of Priam, sprinting at top speed…

---

And how could Hector have fled the fates of death so long? 

---

This is the scale the gods use to weigh the fates of men.

---

Zeus weighs the fates of Hector and Achilles in the scales – and these are real, actual things, these scales - and “down went Hector’s day of doom, dragging him down to the strong House of Death – and the gods left him.”

---

## HECTOR:

No more running from you in fear, Achilles! 
Now my spirit stirs me to meet you face-to-face.

---

Now kill or be killed! Come, we’ll swear to the gods, the highest witnesses – if Zeus allows me to last it out and tear your life away, I will give your body back to your loyal comrades.

---

Swear you’ll do the same. 

---

## ACHILLES:

…Hector, stop!

---

There are no binding oaths between men and lions – wolves and lambs can enjoy no meeting of the minds – they are all bent on hating each other to the death. So with you and me –
---

## POET:

Oh!

---

If you could see the way they look at each other…

---

What do they see? 

---

I wonder if he’s scared – look at him, he may be yelling and shaking his spear but when it comes right down to it he wants to stay alive.

---

And I can even imagine, we could leave here, now, we’ll get drunk together somewhere and we’ll talk about like, “hey remember that battle, when was it 4 days ago when you guys had us pinned against the wall and then out of nowhere that young spearman got your charioteer and you guys got thrown… that was intense. Yeah, yeah, and how bout that bird that came out of nowhere, that was kinda freaky.

---

Yeah, that thing just landed in the middle of the field and for a minute we were all staring at it. Was it a heron?

---

No no no, it was an egret. Oh we call ‘em herons.

---

No, isn’t the heron with the blue tinge to its upper wings? Weeellll, Uhhh, I think we call that an egret…

---

But… no.

---

Whatever he may have been thinking, this is what Achilles said:

---

## ACHILLES:
Now you’ll pay at a stroke for all my comrades’ grief, all you killed in the fury of your spear!

---

## POET:

With that, shaft poised, Achilles hurled and his spear’s long shadow flew but seeing it coming glorious Hector ducked away, crouching down, watching the bronze tip fly past and stab the earth…

---

## HECTOR:

You missed, look – the great godlike Achilles!

---

All bluff, cunning with words, that’s all you are –  But now it’s for you to dodge my brazen spear –

---

## POET:

Shaft poised, he hurled and his spear’s long shadow flew and it struck Achilles’ shield – a dead-center hit – but off and away it glanced and Hector seethed, his hurtling spear, his whole arm’s power poured in a wasted shot. He stood there, cast down…

---

He had no spear in reserve… yes and Hector knew the truth in his heart and the fighter cried aloud,

---

## HECTOR:

…My time has come!

---

And now death, grim death is looming up beside me, no longer far away. No way to escape it now…

---

Well let me die --- but not without struggle, not without glory, no, in some great clash of arms that even men to come will hear of down the years!

---

## POET:

And on that resolve Hector swooped now, swinging his whetted sword and Achilles charged too, bursting with rage, barbaric. 

---

And fire flared from the sharp point of the spear Achilles brandished high in his right hand, bent on Hector’s death, scanning his splendid body – where to pierce it best?

---

The rest of his flesh seemed all encased in armor, burnished, brazen – Achilles’ armor that Hector stripped from strong Patroclus when he killed him –

---

That’s right! Hector is wearing Achilles armor, my god, and so there is Achilles, spear in hand, and he’s looking at himself, in a way, at an image of himself – he’s looking for a weak spot, and he knows exactly where that is, cause it’s his armor.

---

…one spot lay exposed, where collarbones lift the neckbone off the shoulders, the open throat, where the end of life comes quickest – there as Hector charged in fury, brilliant Achilles drove his spear and the point went stabbing clean through the tender neck…

---

Hector crashed in the dust – godlike Achilles gloried over him:

---

## ACHILLES:

Hector – surely you thought when you stripped Patroclus’ armor that you, you would be safe!

---

Never a fear of me – far from the fighting as I was – you fool! 

---

The dogs and birds will maul you, shame your corpse while Achaeans bury my dear friend in glory!

---

## POET:

Struggling for breath, Hector, his helmet flashing, said,

---

## HECTOR:

I beg you, beg you by your life, your parents – don’t let the dogs devour me by the Argive ships! Wait, take the princely ransom of bronze and gold, the gifts my father and noble mother will give you – but give my body to friends to carry home again –

---

## ACHILLES:

Beg no more, you fawning dog – begging me by my parents!

---

Would to god my rage, my fury would drive me now to hack your flesh away and eat you raw –
such agonies you have caused me! Ransom?

---

The dogs and birds will rend you – blood and bone! 
---

## HECTOR:

I know you well – I see my fate before me.

---

Iron inside your chest, that heart of yours. But now beware, or my curse will draw god’s wrath upon your head, that day when Paris and lord Apollo – for all your fighting heart – destroy you at the Scaean Gates!

---

## POET:

Death cut him short. The end closed in around him.

---

Flying free of his limbs his soul went winging down to the House of Death. 

---

## ACHILLES:

Now, come, you sons of Achaea, raise a song of triumph!

---

Down to the ships we march and bear this corpse on high– we have won ourselves great glory. We have brought magnificent Hector down, that man the Trojans glorified in their city like a god!

---

## POET:

So he triumphed and now he was bent on outrage, on shaming noble Hector. Piercing the tendons, ankle to heel behind both feet, he knotted straps of rawhide through them both, lashed them to his chariot, left the head to drag and mounting the car, he whipped his team to a run and breakneck on they flew, holding nothing back.

---

And a thick cloud of dust rose up from the man they dragged, his dark hair swirling round that head so handsome once, all tumbled low in the dust…

---

So his whole head was dragged down in the dust. 

---

It’s so if you’d seen it, the - the waste… Just like… there was one time… uhhhh… yes yes it was a terrible hot day during the Conquest of Sumer – I mean the Conquest of Sargon – uh – the Persian War – no -

## POET:

Hecuba opens her mouth:

Because all this time, uhhh… they were all watching – the Trojans, from the top of the rampart: His mother, Hecuba, his father, his brothers, Helen, all of the Trojans watching Hector die. 

---

Oooooooooooooo

---

(the Poet begins to wail in Ancient Greek): Teknon agoo day-lay: tie nah bay-o-my eye-nah pathosuh Suh-apatosh-nayohtos: noon aw thanatos kie moi-rah ki-cha-nay

[TRANSLATION: My child—my desolation!

---

How can I go on living? You were my pride throughout the city night and day— a blessing to us all, the men and women of Troy: throughout the city they saluted you like a god.You were their greatest glory while you lived – now death and fate have seized you dragged you down!]

---

And all around the ramparts, Hector’s family wailed with the grieving Hecuba.

---

But his wife, Andromache, wasn’t at the wall, she was inside weaving, she hadn’t heard a thing. Busy drawing his bath… she’d talked herself into the idea that he was coming home, he’d need a bath…

---

…then she hears the women wailing, she hears her mother-in-law’s voice, she recognizes that voice— she’s never, ever, heard that voice sound like that before – and her heart pounds, her legs go numb –

---

## ANDROMACHE:

-Oh I know it…	
something terrible’s coming down on Priam’s children.

## POET:

That’s an awful moment, isn’t it?

---

It starts with uhh, a bad feeling or an intuition or why did the phone ring at 3 o’clock in the morning? Or I didn’t get a phone, call, or, he didn’t come home or it’s late, it’s really late, he should have been home by now, I should have heard by now, the plane should have landed by now, he should have called…

---

She starts to walk, trying to keep herself calm, trying not to panic- but her heart begins to race and she starts getting that weird throbbing and she starts, her eyes start to go, kinda dim- she can't actually see where she's going — and she comes out and even before she gets to ask a question she looks out across the plain and she actually sees her husband, dead, being dragged behind the chariot–

---

And she starts to yell at him –

---

## ANDROMACHE:

Now you go down	to the House of Death, the dark depths of the earth, and leave me here to waste away in grief, a widow lost in the royal halls—and the boy only a baby.Hector, what help are you to him, now you are dead?

---

– what help is he to you? Think, even if he escapes the wrenching horrors of war against the Argives, pain and labor will plague him all his days to come.

---

## POET:

You know what she's really saying? She's saying, "I told you so."

---

Hector’s body disappears in a cloud of dust. 

---

Achilles drags his prize to the Greek camp and dumps it in the sand – next to the Argive ships.

---

The Greeks cheer and drink and celebrate. But Achilles’ fury just won’t end… and so he drags Hector’s body round and round Patroclus’ tomb, day after day after day.

---

And the thing you have to ask yourself is: It’s been TEN DAYS!!!!! What’s there left to drag??

---

No no no, you’d be wrong, see, because THE GODS. The gods look down and – I mean really, after all their meddling, after leaving Hector to die, well now they change their minds…

---

They wrap Hector’s body in – oh, a magic shield of storm – Zeus loves him after all – and so Hector’s body is perfect, just – unharmed.

---

Sweet-smelling. 

---

Impossible.

---

So. For ten days, the Trojans have been watching from a distance: the dust rising, funeral pyres smoking, the Greeks carousing and singing songs of the Triumph of Achilles.

---

And... And his Hector’s father, Priam, decides to go - even though he's almost 80 YEARS OLD - he decides to slog through all the battlefields to the Greek camp, to ransom himself, his kingdom, all his treasures, to Achilles to get his son’s body back.

---

He sets off with only one old charioteer in the middle of the night. It's dark and dangerous and – Just as Priam and his driver start getting tired, a young man with fabulous sandals appears in front of them.

---

## HERMES:

What are you old guys up to—? You’re crossing into Greek territory now, you’re about to cross enemy lines – with your wagon full of treasure.

---

You’ve lost your minds. Listen – I’ll help you, I’ll show you the way.

---

## POET:

Priam asks him who he is. But the young man goes (Shhh…).

---

They sweep unseen across the battlefield, past the ramparts past the sentries and when they get to the massive gate - so big that it usually takes 8 men to push open the doors - the young man, their guide, simply whistles (he whistles) and the gates fly open. ---

## HERMES:

Old man, I’ll tell you who I am.

---

I am Hermes. And I can go no further.

---

## POET:

Then he’s gone. (snap) Priam looks up to see Achilles – standing up from the dinner table.

---

It’s like staring into the face of a deathless god. Breathtaking.

---

## PRIAM:

Great Achilles — You are surprised to see me here, an old man. I am Priam, King of Troy.

---

I’ve driven a wagon, full of treasure, all the way here from my city. I will ransom - everything… Look how I kneel at your feet.

---

I have endured what no one on earth has ever done before – I put to my lips the hand of the man who killed my son. 
---

## POET:

Achilles says, he says—

---

## ACHILLES:

You amaze me, old man.

---

Get up!!! Don’t kneel at my feet!!

---

## PRIAM:

You have a father. Remember your father.

---

You're so far away from home, your father's probably suffering right now, no one is there to help him. Your father needs you, and you're far away - in Troy.

---

What would he give to have you home with him? 

---

I'm asking you now, as your father would ask me, give me the body.

---

Let me have the body of my son. 
---

## ACHILLES:

I never cried before I came to Troy.

---

But in these last 40 days, I find myself crying almost every day. I have reason to cry – and so do you, old man.

---

## POET:

And they both start to weep… Priam crying for his dead son, Achilles crying for his aging father, so far away, and for his dead friend Patroclus, and for himself. 
---

## ACHILLES:

Enough.

---

Enough grief, enough tears. What good will our tears do?

---

I won’t see my father again. You can’t bring your son back to life.

---

## PRIAM:

Give me my son! You took him from me!

---

His body is rotting out there on the beach – I’ve had enough of this – LET ME SEE MY SON!! 
---

## ACHILLES:

Don’t make me mad.

---

You don’t know – the way my heart is – so full of rage – I’m sick with it, old man – don’t stir my rage, don’t make me angry, or I’ll…

---

## POET:

And now here’s the thing. What I love singing, and I hope I can make you see: for once, Achilles, who is addicted to rage – as so many of us are, really, when it comes right down to it – this fighting man feels the rage well up in his heart….and he makes it disappear.

---

He just – (Poet breathes out)

---

Achilles lets go of his rage, and goes outside, and he lifts Hector up in his own arms…

---

…Achilles lifted Hector up in his own arms—	

---

And laid him down in his father’s wagon. 
---

## ACHILLES:

OK, it’s done.

---

I’ve laid him in your wagon, old man. No— don’t run out there now — I’ll have my men make a bed for you, out on the porch — in the morning, you will see him, and then you’ll take him home.

---

Oh— one more thing: how many days do you need to bury Prince Hector? 
---

## PRIAM:

Well, we need time to set up his memorial… our city is far from the hills – we’d have to go out and haul in timber for the pyre… we’d need 9 days to mourn him, and then we’d bury him on the 10th day, and one more day to finish his tomb, and have a feast in his honor… 11 days.

---

We would need 11 days. And then we could fight again on the 12th day… if that’s absolutely necessary.

---

## ACHILLES:

Done. You’ll have your 11 days.

---

I’ll make the Greeks stop fighting for 11 days. 

---

## PRIAM:

Put me to bed.

---

## POET:

Priam reached out his hand, and Achilles took it, and led the old man to the porch. Priam slept, dreaming of the journey home, and Achilles slept, dreaming of his father, and the entire Greek Army slept, dreaming of the next day’s battle…

---

…and the sentries guarding the walls of Troy slept, and all of the Trojan civilians slept, and all of the Trojan soldiers slept.

---

And in the countryside, the farmers and the shepherds and the animals slept, and in the Greek ships the slaves and the oarsmen slept, and even, way up on Olympus, Zeus lay his head on Hera’s shoulder, and even the gods fell asleep…

---

I don’t want to tell you about what happens next – I know you know - about the trick that did it – the Trojan Horse – I can’t do it – how the Greeks pretended to leave, and Troy rejoiced and they thought it was over, the war was over – but that night Greek soldiers snuck out – and began the slaughter and the burning –the Sack of Troy, that’s not – I’m not singing that song…

---

The song of the murder of Priam, the song of the death of Achilles…

---

The song of Hector’s infant son thrown from the battlements – how the Greek soldier held him up in one hand, but the baby laughed, the soldiers’ helmet made him think of his father, and this time he thought it was a game – the sound of the boy’s head splitting on the pavement…

---

The song of the Trojan Women, all of them kidnapped and raped and taken to Greece, the song of Aeneas escaping with his father on his back, the song of Odysseus, trying to get home, no, it’s too much, all these songs…

---

Imagine it for yourselves, the destruction of a city, a civilization, you know what that looks like…

---

…like… Persepolis…
…like… Babylon…
…like…

---

Alexandria, all that history lost… 
…like…

---

Constantinople, burning for weeks…

---

…like… the Aztec temples, razed…

---

…like… Dresden…Hiroshima…
…like… Sarajevo…. …like…

Kabul….

---

…like… Aleppo…
I will tell you this:

---

Cassandra saw them first.

---

Priam and the wagon and the body of Hector. Priam told his people of the cease-fire, not to worry, there would be no war for 11 whole days, they could bury Hector the proper way.

---

And so they built a pyre, and they mourned him, and on the 10th night they burned his body – until the sun came up. 

---

At last, when young Dawn with her rose-red fingers shone once more, the people massed around illustrious Hector’s pyre…	

---

And once they’d gathered, crowding the meeting grounds, they first put out the fires with glistening wine, wherever the flames still burned in all their fury.

---

Then they collected the white bones of Hector— all his brothers, his friends-in-arms, mourning, and warm tears came streaming down their cheeks. They placed the bones they found in a golden chest, shrouding them round and round in soft purple cloths.

---

They quickly lowered the chest in a deep, hollow grave and over it piled a cope of huge stones closely set, then hastily heaped a barrow, posted lookouts all around for fear the Achaen combat troops would launch their attack before the time agreed. 

---

And once they’d heaped the mound they turned back home to Troy, and gathering once again they shared a splendid funeral feast in Hector’s honor, held in the house of Priam, king by will of Zeus.(in Greek)
hós hoig ámfiepón tafon Héktoros híppodamóio.

---

And so the Trojans buried Hector breaker of horses. 

---

You see?

---
