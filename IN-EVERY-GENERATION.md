## YAEL:
Hineni.

## DEV:
Sorry
---
## YAEL:
No, go ahead.
---
## DEV:
Hineni, Here I am, 
---
ready to perform the mitzvah 
---
of retelling the story 
---
of the Exodus from Egypt. 
---
## YAEL:
This is the bread of affliction 
---
that our ancestors ate in the land of Egypt. 
---
As it says in the Torah, 
---
“seven days shall you eat matzot - 
---
the bread of poverty and persecution” 
---
so that you may “remember that you were a slave in Egypt.” 
---
Let all who are hungry, come and eat. 
---
Let all who are in need, come and share the Pesach meal. 
---
This year we are still here 
---
Next year, in the land of Israel. 
---
This year we are still slaves 
---
Next year, free people.

No. I’m just saying

I have about a thousand questions I’d like to ask God,

you know, if He has the time.

## DEV:
Four is a mystical number in Judaism. 
---
In Passover, you know, 
---
there are the four questions. 
---
The four sons. 
---
Four cups of wine.

It symbolizes wholeness.

Which can only come from experiencing

both slavery and freedom at the same time.

## YAEL:
Yeah no

## VALERIA:
Let’s sing “Go Down Moses”!

## YAEL:
It’s cultural appropriation, Ma.
---
It’s a spiritual.

## PAOLA:
It’s about Moses.

## YAEL:
It’s about slavery.

We were slaves too!

They tried to kills us.

They didn’t.

Um. I guess I’ll go?

Next is the ten plagues.

“As we prepare to spill wine from our cup

at the mention of each plague,

we recall the sentence from the Torah, 
---
‘Rejoice not when your enemy falls.’”

Ha!

Ma!

Che? Abbiamo fatto festa quando hanno ucciso Eichmann.

Ok, uh.

“Our Rabbis taught that 
---
when the children of Israel sang songs of praise to God 
---
as the Egyptians drowned in the sea, 
---
the angels wished to join in these songs 
---
and were stopped by God who said, 
---
‘These are my creatures who are drowning in the sea! 
---
For this you would sing songs of praise?’ 
---
And so we diminish this cup of joy, 
---
for our redemption had to come through the destruction of others.”
---
You know this was only invented in 1947 or something.
---
## VALERIA:
What?
---
## DEV:
Yeah, the dipping our finger in wine. 
---
‘Diminishing our cup of joy.’ 
---
It’s from a Reform Rabbi in America, 
---
like 70 years ago or whatever.
---
## YAEL:
Did Dad tell you that?
---
## DEV:
No, just like...
---
I think back in the day it was all about like, 
---
like not getting killed.
---
And like hiding from the Romans and the Cosacks
---
## PAOLA:
And the Germans.
---
## DEV:
Yeah, we didn’t have time to cry 
---
over our oppressors’ suffering.

## PAOLA:
Amen.

But here we’re not...

I mean, we’re free.

We’re not free.

## VALERIA:
Ma!

## PAOLA:
Did you see on the news?

They desecrated another Jewish cemetery in Chicago.

I’m not very smart,

Yes, but

No, that’s not why I wanted to

## DEV:
You’re seriously gonna do this at Seder?

## YAEL:
It’s just, in one of my classes this semester,

we’re studying epigenetics.

You know what that is?

## PAOLA:
Do I look like Einstein?

## VALERIA:
Well, you do have the

## PAOLA:
Never mind, don’t answer that.

## YAEL:
Well, it’s like how the expression of your genes can change

and be passed down based on situational factors.

So a few years ago they did this study on mice at Emory. 
---
They trained male mice to fear the smell of cherry blossoms 
---
by pairing the smell with a small electric shock. 
---
## PAOLA:
Poverini!
---
## YAEL:
Then they took the sperm from these mice 
---
and used it to inseminate female mice. 
---
And the baby and even the grandbaby mice, 
---
who never in their lives smelled cherry blossom, 
---
they had the same fearful response to the smell. 
---
So, like, they actually inherited the trauma.
---
## VALERIA:
Wow, hon.
---
## YAEL:
Yeah. 
---
And so this Doctor in New York figured if it works on mice, 
---
it must be true for humans too. 
---
So she studied the progeny of Holocaust survivors 
---
and found that they’re, like, 
---
predisposed to stress and anxiety disorders.

like, if I could study my own DNA

that would be really cool research.

## DEV:
Judaism’s never been just an ethnicity, though.
---
## YAEL:
Um. Yes it is.
I mean, it’s a religion too,

kind of, but it’s also an ethnicity.

## DEV:
Judaism’s always accepted people in.

Think about way back in the day,

in the desert, like the first Passover,

O.G. Passover. 
---
Moses married a Midianite, Tzipporah.
---
## YAEL:
So?
---
## DEV:
So his kids were half-Midianite. 
---
And do you think they weren’t Jews?
---
Because it wasn’t their full birthright?
---
## YAEL:
You sound like Dad.
---
## DEV:
What? No I don’t.
---
## YAEL:
Yes you do. 
---
Like that sermon he wrote that went viral a couple years ago. 
---
About Tzipporah and like embracing the stranger.
---
template: overlap
## DEV:
That wasn’t his point.

## YAEL:
Then what was his point?
---
## DEV:
That Tzipporah’s not a stranger.

## YAEL:
Ok whatever, I wasn’t saying

## VALERIA:
Girls, enough. 
---
Honey, hell, you’re more Jewish than any of us.
---
## DEV:
I mean, genetically I’m not. 
---
But I was raised with the the language, 
---
the holidays, the stories, 
---
all the mishugas.
---
## PAOLA:
Mishugas is an Ashkenazi word.
---
## YAEL:
The world is so Ashkenormative.

Whatever.

Even though I don’t look like you,

I’d be on a list.

So did I.

## YAEL:
I didn’t mean...

I just,

I wanted to,

I don’t know,

understand our family better.

## DEV:
Like this project?

## YAEL:
Dev, I’m sorry. Really.

I didn’t know it would bring up all this stuff.

## DEV:
It’s not.

## YAEL:
OK.

## YAEL:
I wish we could have heard more of Nonno’s stories, 
---
now that he can’t...
---
## DEV:
No way he would have let you record him.
---
## YAEL:
How do you know?
---
## DEV:
We talked A LOT this year, Yaya, 
---
and I asked him about the war 
---
and all that stuff and he knew he was going to lose his speech 
---
and he still wouldn’t talk.
---
## YAEL:
Oh. I didn’t know you

## DEV:
Wanted to know about where I come from?

## DEV:
Ohmygoddon’t remind me.

## YAEL:
I’m like hell yeah that’s my sister.

Nonna’s been acting crazy lately.

And Mom’s like barely keeping it together.
---
You know, she has Chinese take-out in the kitchen.
---
## YAEL:
What?
---
## DEV:
Yeah. 
---
I found it underneath the sink. 
---
She’s not even gonna eat all this food she made.
---
## YAEL:
That’s crazy.
---
## DEV:
I think she’s like purposefully breaking Passover,
---
just to spite Dad.
---
## YAEL:
Well, can you blame her? 
---
It’s only been like ten months.
---
I thought about staying at school.
---
## DEV:
Yaya
---
## YAEL:
I didn’t obviously. 
---
I’m just saying. 
---
I don’t blame her.
---
## DEV:
When I got home from work the other day, 
---
she was giving away the ArtScroll Talmuds. 
---
Like what is Goodwill gonna do with 2,000 dollars worth of holy text?
---
## YAEL:
Yikes.

## YAEL:
Are you ok?

## DEV:
Yeah, I’m fine.

You’re happy here?

Living at home and working part-time

as a receptionist at a rock gym?

Oh yeah, that’s the American dream.

I don’t know.

You get to be outdoorsy and all.

A few weeks, probably.

I don’t know if I’ll do it.

I’m sure Dad is excited.

Following in his footsteps.

Runs in the family.

I hope that’s ok.

I didn’t know what...

Tofu’s perfect.

## VALERIA:
And there’s plenty of vegetables,

and lots of desserts.

It looks delicious, Ma.

## YAEL:
Thank you.

## YAEL:
Woah! New teeth, Nonna?

## VALERIA:
What? Oh my god, Ma!
---
## PAOLA:
I didn’t tell you?
---
## VALERIA:
No!
---
## DEV:
She’s had them for a couple weeks.
---
## VALERIA:
What happened?
---
## PAOLA:
I’m old, what can I tell you? 
---
The dentist told me I needed new teeth, 
---
I got new teeth.
---
## DEV:
And she was too cheap 
---
template: overlap
to get the 4000 dollar surgery, so...

## VALERIA:
Ma!
---
## PAOLA:
2000 dollars per tooth? 
---
What am I, Rockefeller? 
---
No thank you. 
---
So I got these dentures. 
---
Anyway. 
---
One day I woke up 
---
I take them out to go to sleep 
---
and I couldn’t find them. 
---
I looked everywhere for them. 
---
Under the bed, 
---
in between the cushions on the couch, 
---
everywhere! 
---
So then it hit me. 
---
The dog must have swallowed them. 
---
I was beside myself. 
---
So I rushed poor Bacio to the Vet 
---
and they gave him this liquid thing.
---
## DEV:
Hydrogen peroxide.
---
## PAOLA:
Right. 
---
Hydrogen peroxide. 
---
And it made him throw up. 
---
But no teeth came up. 
---
Meanwhile, this poor dog, 
---
he was so scared. 
---
Gosh, you should have seen him. 
---
Shaking and crying. 
---
So I decided to pray for him. 
---
You know the last time I prayed? 
---
When the Germans were dropping bombs on us. 
---
That’s when. 
---
Anyway, I prayed and prayed. 
---
“God, please let Bacio be OK.” 
---
I told myself if God helped him, 
---
I’d promise to be a better Jew. 
---
And so the Vet gave him more peroxide, 
---
but still, no teeth. 
---
But just wait. 
---
Devorah searched the house again 
---
and what do you know? 
---
There it was, under my pillow, 
---
can you believe it? 
---
Bacio was fine in a few hours. 
---
Isn’t that a miracle? 
---
B’shert, I tell you.
---
## VALERIA:
So how are you being a better Jew now?
---
## PAOLA:
Well I’m here, aren’t I?
---
## YAEL:
You’re here every year.
---
## PAOLA:
Yes, but with your Nonno this year... 
---
But here we are, Baruch Hashem.
---
## DEV:
He looks happier than I’ve seen him in a long time.
---
## VALERIA:
They were under your pillow the whole time?
---
That’s not a miracle.
---
## PAOLA:
What? 
---
You don’t believe that things are meant to be?
---
## VALERIA:
Not really.
---
## PAOLA:
Look at your beautiful daughters.
---
## PAOLA:
A miracle!
---
What else could it be?
---
template: noise

---
## YAEL:
Can I...?
---
## DEV:
Oh. Uh, sure. 
---
There’s another bib in his bag by the door.
---
## PAOLA:
You were a miracle.
---
## VALERIA:
You were a miracle too, hon.
---
## DEV:
I thought you didn’t believe in that.
---
## VALERIA:
I don’t. But you were. 
---
## DEV:
It’s really good, Ma. 
---
You should eat.
---
## VALERIA:
It would be better with bread.
---
## DEV:
You used to love Passover.
---
## VALERIA:
Well.
---
## DEV:
Then why did you do all of this?
---
## VALERIA:
It’s your Nonno’s favorite holiday, 
---
of course I’m doing it.
---
## VALERIA:
I’m sorry about New Haven.
---
## DEV:
It’s fine.
---
## VALERIA:
I’m not even sure if
---
## DEV:
You should go. Really.
---
## VALERIA:
I don’t want to leave my Dad.
---
## DEV:
Ma, he probably...
---
## VALERIA:
Won’t make it to July. 
---
Yeah.
---
At least we’re all together now.
---
---
## VALERIA:
Well maybe we’ll all take a trip this summer. 
---
Go to Hawaii, or something. Relax.
---
## DEV:
Nonna’s way too stubborn to relax.
---
## VALERIA:
Ha!
---
## DEV:
I was, um. 
---
I was thinking about... 
---
I mean, obviously I’ll wait to see how Nonno...
---
but
Uh...
---
I’ve kind of been saving up to go to China.
---
## VALERIA:
China?
---
## DEV:
Um. Yeah. If that’s...
---
## VALERIA:
Of course, hon.
---
I didn’t know you were...
---
## DEV:
Not really. I mean...
---
I don’t know. 
---
But it’s Passover. 
---
And on Passover we remember what our ancestors did 
---
tens of thousands of years ago. 
---
Like we can actually remember a past 
---
that’s tens of thousands of years old.
---
And I don’t even know what my people- 
---
I mean, you know, 
---
my other people, birth people, 
---
whatever
---
what they did, like, ten years ago. 
---
Twenty-three years ago.
---
## VALERIA:
I think that’s great.
---
## DEV:
Yeah?
---
## VALERIA:
Yeah, I do.
---
---
## DEV:
There’s this story in the Torah.
---
template: overlap
## VALERIA:
Dev, please.

## DEV:
No, just...
---
When the Israelites are in the desert, 
---
they complain, saying they’re going to die off and stuff.
---
template: overlap
## VALERIA:
What does that have to...

## DEV:
Wait. 
---
So God made flowers bloom. 
---
In the desert. 
---
Out of thin air. 
---
A miracle. 
---
Like as a sign that they would survive. 
---
That the Jewish people would bloom. 
---
They would never die. 
---
## VALERIA:
Ok...
---
## DEV:
I just... it’s cool. 
---
Whether it was a miracle or not, whatever. 
---
It’s cool that we’re still here. 
---
Telling the same story. 
---
Surviving. 
---
You know, blooming.
---
## VALERIA:
Maybe we should stop telling those stories.
---
## DEV:
Mom.
---
## VALERIA:
Flowers don’t bloom in the desert. 
---
They can’t. 
---
The Jews were starving. 
---
They were dying off. 
---
Why do they tell us these stories 
---
template: overlap
and just cover up all the bad stuff when there’s

## DEV:
Not everything’s about Dad.
---
## VALERIA:
That’s not what I said. 
---
I just...

---
template: overlap
I don’t feel like I’m blooming.

---
I don’t know! 
---
Like you haven’t been dreading 
---
what I want to do with my life
---
## VALERIA:
So I should just not say anything? 
---
## DEV:
You know that’s not what I...
---
## VALERIA:
So your plan is what? 
---
To leave for China 
---
and then go right to Rabbinical school? 
---
template: overlap
## YAEL:
China?

## PAOLA:
What’s in China?
---
template: overlap
## DEV:
No, it’s not a... 
I’m not even going to get in so this is

## VALERIA:
Dev’s going to China this summer.
---
template: overlap
## YAEL:
Ooh can I come?

## DEV:
I thought you were working in that lab
---
template: overlap
## YAEL:
Not the whole summer

## VALERIA:
And I’ll be here. 
By myself.
---
## DEV:
The school is in LA, Ma. 
---
So I wouldn’t even be leaving.
---
## VALERIA:
You’d have to be in Israel for your third year. 
---
template: overlap
Your father

## DEV:
This isn’t about him! 
It’s about me! 
---
template: overlap
I’m trying to figure out who I am and where

## VALERIA:
Of course it’s about him. 
How can it not be
---
## PAOLA:
Basta! 
---
Forse sarebbe l’ultimo Seder di tuo padre.
---
## VALERIA:
Lo so! 
---
Why do you think I did all of this? 
---
## PAOLA:
So Rabbi. 
---
What does the Torah say about DNR?
---
## DEV:
Well now I don’t want to
---
## YAEL:
Oh come on.
---
## DEV:
Not if you’re all gonna look at me 
---
template: overlap
like I’m the demon child

## PAOLA:
Please, gioia. 
---
For Nonno.
---
## DEV:
Well, um, Pirkei Avot tells us that 
---
“we are not to judge another person 
---
until we have been in their place.”
---
## VALERIA:
Fluffy bullshit, as usual.
---
## PAOLA:
Parla per bene,  
---
Valeria. Sheesh!
---
## DEV:
But there are kind of two opposing camps. 
---
On the one hand, uh... 
---
Jewish philosophy is based on the idea that life is sacred. 
---
The Talmud tells us that
---
one who closes the eyes of a dying person, 
---
bringing about death by mere moments, 
---
is a full-fledged murderer.
---
## PAOLA:
Aha!
---
## VALERIA:
Oh come on!
---
## DEV:
But... 
---
Halakha also recognizes that life is finite. 
---
If there’s no... cure, uh, 
---
medication may be withdrawn. 
---
If a patient wishes.
---
## PAOLA:
Which he doesn’t.
---
## YAEL:
So. Just. 
Make up your own rules?
---
## VALERIA:
Testa dura! 
---
When I’m that age, girls, just pull the plug.
---
template: overlap
## DEV:
Ma!

## YAEL:
Mom!
---
## VALERIA:
Not if I have a cold! 
---
But anything worse, hasta la vista.
---
## PAOLA:
Basta, Valeria. 
---
---
## PAOLA:
Yaya, tell us about the young man you’re seeing.
---
template: overlap
## VALERIA:
What?

## YAEL:
Nonna!
---
## PAOLA:
I didn’t know it was a secret.
---
template: overlap
## YAEL:
It’s not. I mean...

## VALERIA:
Everything’s a secret tonight.
---
## DEV:
You’re seeing someone?
---
## YAEL:
Kind of, yeah.
---
## VALERIA:
Who?
---
## YAEL:
His name is Nate. Nate Moore. 
---
He’s in Branford with me.
---
## PAOLA:
Moore. 
---
That’s an awfully goyischa name
---
## VALERIA:
Ma.
---
## PAOLA:
What? Is he Jewish?
---
He’s not Jewish?
---
## YAEL:
No.
---
## PAOLA:
Ay. Capisci, Davide?
---
template: overlap
## VALERIA:
Ma, stop.

## PAOLA:
What? You approve?
---
## VALERIA:
Is he a nice guy?
---
## YAEL:
The nicest.
---
## PAOLA:
You couldn’t find the nicest Jewish guy?
---
## YAEL:
Isn’t that discrimination?
---
## PAOLA:
Valeria, devi parlare con lei!
---
## VALERIA:
Ma, what? 
---
template: overlap
If he’s a good guy

## YAEL:
He is.
---
## VALERIA:
So I’m just saying 
---
that it’s more important 
---
to find someone who respects you, 
---
who loves you, 
---
who will be loyal to you, 
---
than what holidays he celebrates.
---
template: overlap
## DEV:
Seriously?

## YAEL:
Thank you.
---
## PAOLA:
You know how many Jews we lost? 
---
Your grandparents? 
---
Your aunts and uncles? 
Cousins? 
---
## VALERIA:
Non di nuovo!
---
## PAOLA:
Because we were Jewish. 
---
Because we wanted to raise our children Jewish. 
---
Not to have goyischa great-grandchildren 
---
asking us what we got them for Christmas.
---
## VALERIA:
Ma, basta! 
---
## YAEL:
You never harass Dev about who’s she dating!
---
## DEV:
Yael!
---
## PAOLA:
She doesn’t date! 
---
If she did, you bet your tuches I would harass her.
---
## DEV:
It’s not that I don’t date.
---
## PAOLA:
Oh?
---
## DEV:
I just don’t tell you about my dates.
---
template: overlap
## VALERIA:
Who are you dating?

## YAEL:
You’re dating someone?
---
## PAOLA:
Is he Jewish?
---
## DEV:
I’m just saying.
---
## VALERIA:
Well, good luck dating when you’re a Rabbi. 
---
## DEV:
Ohmygod
---
## YAEL:
She’s right. 
---
How many birthdays did Dad miss?
---
## PAOLA:
Yaya, per favore.
---
Is Nate at least a convert-able?
---
## YAEL:
Convertible?
---
## PAOLA:
Will he convert?
---
## YAEL:
We’ve only been dating for a few months.
---
## PAOLA:
Ah, well, sei giovane. 
---
Avrai molti fidanzati.
---
## YAEL:
I really like him, Nonna.
---
## PAOLA:
I dated a goy guy once, you know.
---
## DEV:
Really?
---
## PAOLA:
Back in Italy, during the war. 
---
At the convent. 
---
## YAEL:
I haven’t heard this story.
---
## PAOLA:
Your Nonno doesn’t like me to talk about other men. 
---
Right, gioia?
---
template: noise
grunt
---
## PAOLA:
Anyway. 
---
There was this handsome young blonde man 
---
who fixed things around the convent. 
---
He was kind. 
---
Never said a word to anyone about who I was. 
---
I think his name was Giorgio, 
---
or Rolfe, or Federico or something. 
---
He was always looking at me. 
---
Especially when I sang.
---
## YAEL:
You sang?
---
## PAOLA:
Of course! 
---
The nuns taught me all sorts of songs.
---
## DEV:
Nonna, I think you’re getting confused 
---
with The Sound of Music.
---
## PAOLA:
No, they taught me all sorts of Christian songs.
---
And By the way, 
---
the movie was garbage, total nonsense.
---
template: overlap
## YAEL:
We know!

## DEV:
We know!
---
## PAOLA:
When we were running for our lives through the hills to Italy, 
---
you think we could sing and dance? 
---
“The hills are alive!” Nonsense. 
---
I love the music, though. 
---
Beautiful.
---
template: song
“Edelweiss, edelweiss...”
---
## YAEL:
So what happened to Rolfe?
---
## PAOLA:
Oh. Well, when the War was over, 
---
I wanted to find my family. 
---
The nuns wanted to keep me of course. 
---
They were very kind, but I wanted my Mama. 
---
I didn’t know she was dead. 
---
So I left. 
Ciao. 
Goodbye. 
---
I went to the DP camp, 
---
and I met your Nonno. 
---
Much more handsome. 
---
And Jewish. 
---
## PAOLA:
Oy, not again.
---
template: overlap
## YAEL:
I’m sorry, Dev. Really.

## DEV:
No you’re not. 
---
template: overlap
This is fun for you.

## YAEL:
She was going to find out eventually.
---
## DEV:
Yeah, when I decided to tell her.
---
template: overlap
## YAEL:
And when were you going to decide

## DEV:
Literally any day but today.
---
## YAEL:
Well I’m sorry, ok?
---
## YAEL:
Oy, Ma, you’re killing my diet.
---
## PAOLA:
You and me both.
---
## YAEL:
You’re timeless, Nonna.
---
## PAOLA:
And you’re a liar, carina.
---
template: noise
knock at the door

## PAOLA:
Who’s knocking at this time of night?

## DEV:
Maybe it’s Elijah?
---
template: noise
grunt
---
## YAEL:
I’ll go get it. 
---
## DEV:
Did you know Nonna dated a goy
---
during the War?
---
## PAOLA:
Carina!
---
## VALERIA:
That’s not true.
---
## PAOLA:
How would you know?
---
## VALERIA:
Ha!
---
## PAOLA:
What? I don’t tell you everything.
---
## VALERIA:
You can’t just make up stories, Ma.
---
## DEV:
Mom!
---
## PAOLA:
I’m not!
---
## YAEL:
Girl scouts. 
I said no.
---
## VALERIA:
Damn, I’m out of Samoas.
---
## PAOLA:
È Pasqua, Valeria!
---
## YAEL:
They’ll be more than enough 
---
leftover dessert anyway, Ma.
---
## DEV:
Mmm it’s so good. 
---
I can’t believe it doesn’t have flour.
---
## PAOLA:
Proprio come la torta di Pasqua di mia madre. 
---
## VALERIA:
It’s her recipe.
---
## PAOLA:
Brava!
---
## YAEL:
You still have Nonna Valeria’s recipes?
---
## PAOLA:
Do you just turn off your ears when I talk? 
---
## VALERIA:
There are a lot of stories, Ma.
---
## YAEL:
That’s why I want to record them!
---
## PAOLA:
Well, here’s one. 
---
I kept the recipes in my brassiere all throughout the war.
---
## YAEL:
You were five when you left Zagreb. 
---
Were you really wearing a bra?
---
## PAOLA:
I was quite developed at a young age. 
---
template: overlap
Like you.

## YAEL:
I’m nineteen!
---
## PAOLA:
OK, maybe in my socks. 
---
I don’t know. 
---
I’m 85 years old, what do you want?
---
## DEV:
Well, I can’t hide anything in my bra. 
---
Tiny boobies.
---
## YAEL:
I wish I had your tette! 
---
You can wear anything you want 
---
and run and climb and stuff 
---
without them jiggling everywhere.
---
## VALERIA:
Girls, your Nonno’s sitting right there.
---
## PAOLA:
Oh he doesn’t mind. 
---
When we first moved here, 
---
your Nonno made us speak English all the time. 
---
Right, gioia? 
---
To assimilate, you know, learn the language. 
---
Except when we would talk about three things:
---
## ALL:
Judaism, money, and the bathroom.
---
## PAOLA:
Ok, so you listen to some of my stories.
---
## DEV:
Even I know what “quel posto” means.
---
## YAEL:
The bathroom, really?
---
template: overlap
## PAOLA:
È volgare!

## YAEL:
How is it vulgar?
---
## PAOLA:
Do you really want me to talk about making pishy and poopy?
---
## PAOLA:
See?
---
## YAEL:
OK, but Judaism? 
---
Why couldn’t you talk about that?
---
## PAOLA:
Ah, essere giovane e spensierata.
---
## VALERIA:
Aaand we’re back again.
---
## PAOLA:
It was bad enough with our accents. 
---
You think we wanted to broadcast who we were?
---
## YAEL:
But you’re white. 
---
And in America. 
---
That’s like having literally the most privilege in the world. 
---
## VALERIA:
Yael.
---
## YAEL:
And isn’t that what this holiday is supposed to be about? 
---
We remind ourselves every year that we suffered. 
---
That we were slaves. 
---
That we were oppressed. 
---
This same old story over and over again. 
---
But we’re not the victims anymore.
---
## DEV:
So what? We shouldn’t celebrate Passover, 
---
template: overlap
the most important

## YAEL:
Well we’re free now, so
---
## PAOLA:
Free for now.
---
## VALERIA:
Non di nuovo
---
## PAOLA:
In Zagreb, when I was a little girl, 
---
we thought we were free. 
---
We were, what did you say,
---
“privileged,” right?
---
My father was a dentist, you know? 
---
## YAEL:
We know.
## DEV:
We know.
---
## PAOLA:
But it’s a cycle. 
---
When something goes wrong
---
the economy crashes, there’s a war, whatever
---
we’re to blame for everything. 
---
The Jews.
--- 
Then my father loses his job.
---
The Germans start knocking on doors, dropping bombs. 
---
We’re not Yugoslavs anymore. 
---
We’re Jews. 
---
Everyone hates us. 
---
## YAEL:
OK. 
---
I’m sorry, Nonna. 
---
## PAOLA:
No. Don’t you be sorry. 
---
Arguing is good. 
---
Arguing is Jewish. 
---
Tip-toeing around other peoples’ feelings all the time, 
---
that’s what Wasps are for.
---
template: overlap
## VALERIA:
Ma!

## PAOLA:
What? È vero.
---
template: overlap
## YAEL:
OK. So then it was

## VALERIA:
Yael, let’s just finish the meal.
---
## YAEL:
See? That’s the problem! 
---
We’re all too uncomfortable to talk about our privilege. 
---
People say, “The Jews control the banks. 
---
The Jews control Hollywood. 
---
The Jews control the White House.” 
---
And then we throw a fit and say 
---
“oh, that’s antisemitism.”
---
## DEV:
It is.
---
## YAEL:
I know. Obviously. 
---
But isn’t it also kind of true?
---
## PAOLA:
You should be proud. 
---
We are in those positions 
---
because we’re a people of the book. 
---
We value knowledge. 
---
We value education.
---
## DEV:
All people value knowledge and education.
---
## VALERIA:
That’s true.
---
## YAEL:
So you agree when Dev says it.
---
template: overlap
## VALERIA:
That’s not true.

## YAEL:
Whatever. 
---
All people value knowledge and education, right. 
---
But because we’re white, 
---
and we’re in America, and we have money, 
---
we have the privilege to be in those positions
---
## PAOLA:
Yale is filling your head with all sorts of garbage. 
---
The school had a Jewish quota until the 1960’s, you know.
---
## VALERIA:
That was over 50 years ago, Ma. 
---
## PAOLA:
That may feel like a long time to you, 
---
but to me
---
## VALERIA:
Today, there are more than 30 different Jewish clubs at UCLA. 
---
And those students, 
---
they’re marching for Black Lives Matter, for metoo. 
---
A group from Hillel went to the border last week 
---
to protest family separation. 
---
I think 
---
being Jewish means standing up 
---
for those who are being oppressed now.
---
## YAEL:
Exactly! 
---
We say “Never Again.” 
---
Never Again can’t be this like catchphrase 
---
to dismiss our own privilege 
---
and the harm that we do as white people.
---
## PAOLA:
But who will march for us when the time comes? Huh?
---
## YAEL:
Nonna, I just think it’s time we realize 
---
that it was horrible back then. 
---
It was. 
---
But it’s very different here, now.
---
## PAOLA:
Like I said. 
---
For now. 
---
Wait till something goes wrong. 
---
## DEV:
Something is wrong. 
---
## PAOLA:
And what do you know? 
---
Swatstikas and guns wow wow wow. 
---
They’re back in fashion.
---
## YAEL:
Dev, you of all people 
---
template: overlap
should know what I’m talking about

## DEV:
Me of all people? Seriously?
---
template: overlap
## VALERIA:
Yael!

## DEV:
One minute you act like I’m not here 
---
and then all of a sudden 
---
template: overlap
when I don’t take your side you 

## YAEL:
No, I just mean that... 
---
template: overlap
you know what I

## DEV:
Yes. I know what you mean.
---
## VALERIA:
Can’t it be both? 
---
I mean, can’t we be multiple things at once?
---
## YAEL:
Sure, but there are people that are in actual danger. 
---
There’s real violence, 
---
real hatred, for people who were not born here, 
---
or who aren’t white. 
---
And we’re responsible for that!
---
## PAOLA:
How am I responsible?
---
## YAEL:
We’re like perpetuating the system. 
---
We came here with a 200 year head start.
---
## PAOLA:
Your Nonno and I came here with nothing.
---
## YAEL:
Exactly! And look at us now.
---
## PAOLA:
È vero, carina.
---
But first it was the Egyptians, 
---
then the Babylonians, then the Greeks, 
---
the Romans, the Christians, the Crusades, 
---
the Ghettos, the Pogroms, 
---
then the Germans.
---
Who’s next?
---
Five hundred or even fifty years is a long time for the young. 
---
But for the old, 
---
it’s not long enough to forget. 
---
Or to rest.
---
---
## VALERIA:
You’re still hungry?
---
## YAEL:
It’s Passover.
---
You didn’t say anything when Dev took more food.

## PAOLA:
Well Dev is...

Skinnier? 

## VALERIA:
Yaya.

## DEV:
Oh come on.

## YAEL:
What? It’s true.

## PAOLA:
I should watch my weight too.

Not just you.

## VALERIA:
You each have your own

beautiful and different strengths.

## YAEL:
Yeah well

I want one that doesn’t make you 
cringe every time I want to eat.

We weren’t cringing.

because you don’t give a shit

Yes I do! Why would

this is a problem for me, right?

How could I possibly know what it’s like to look different from you?

The one thing that I...

## YAEL:
What?

## DEV:
Seriously?

You’re like “oh I’m special because I have ‘disordered eating’?”

Like as if that’s your special little trauma narrative, 
---
that you can’t control what you eat?

## PAOLA:
Devorah!

## DEV:
Is that Nonno’s fault too? 
---
He starved in Auschwitz,

and so you like inherited an eating disorder?

Is that why you’re doing this?

That’s enough, Dev.

How did this turn into a fight?

## DEV:
You’re a trauma junkie,

everything with you turns into a fight.

I’m a cannibal, I hate the environment

When did I ever say that to you?

we all bend over backwards

but I found some second cousins

Projection: April 2050, 15th of Nissan 5810. Los Angeles, California.
## DEV: (54), ## YAEL: (50) and ## VALERIA: (88) sit around the table. ## DEV: and ## YAEL: pick at their mostly empty plates of food. ## DEV: wears a Kippa. ## VALERIA: is in a wheelchair. She no longer has the ability to speak. She is hooked up to a thought-to-text machine.
Anytime ## VALERIA: grunts or responds to the conversation in any way, the translation of her responses should be subtitled for the audience.
## DEV:
Hineni, Here I am, ready to perform the Levi Family tradition of recreating the story of the Exodus from Egypt. As it says in the Haggadah, “let all who are hungry, come and eat. Let all who are in need, come and share the Pesach meal.” So, as our Nonno did in Auschwitz for Judel, we too shall share our food with those in need. 
## YAEL:
Amen.
## YAEL: and ## DEV: take all of the leftover food and ritualistically put it into to-go boxes.
## YAEL:
Can I save some for the girls?
## DEV:
Yaya. It’s for the elderly who became homeless when the Hebrew Homes were shut / down
## YAEL:
I know, I know. 
But Maya’s going to be so sad she missed her Aunt ## DEV:’s cooking. Just a bite?
## DEV:
Fine, just a bite.
Silence as they finish the ritual.
## YAEL:
Oh, I missed this.
## DEV:
It’s nice to have you back.
## YAEL:
Nice to be back, sis.
## DEV:
Mom was so excited you were coming this year she insisted I make-
Oh shoot. Let me go get it.
## DEV: exits to the kitchen.
## YAEL:
What is she getting?
## VALERIA: grunts (You’ll have to see.)
yael
Ugh fine. 
Come ti senti?
(How are you feeling, Ma?)
## VALERIA: gives a thumbs up (My two girls under the same roof? I couldn’t be happier.)
## YAEL: takes her mother’s hand.
## YAEL:
Me too, Ma.
## VALERIA: grunts (She missed you.)
## YAEL:
You know I missed her too.

## YAEL:
Oh wow! It looks amazing.
## VALERIA: gives a thumbs up (Yeah, it looks beautiful, hon.). 
## DEV:
Thanks, Ma.
They eat in silence for a bit.
## YAEL:
It was a really nice service last week.
You did a beautiful job. 
## DEV:
Thanks.
## YAEL:
I’m glad Beit Yisrael is safe again. 
Dad would have wanted to be buried there.
## DEV:
Yeah.
## YAEL:
And so many of his old congregants showed up. 
I thought they’d all left or converted.
## DEV:
Yeah, most of them have.

## DEV:
I can’t believe Zoey starts middle school in the fall. 
## VALERIA: grunts (They grow up so fast.)
## YAEL:
I know, right?
## DEV:
And those boobies!
## YAEL:
I know! 
## DEV:
They’re like mini ## YAEL:-sized boobies.
## YAEL:
I took her bra shopping for the first time last week.
## DEV:
Oh my god.
## YAEL:
She was mortified.
## DEV:
I bet. 
## YAEL:
Like “Mom, give me your wallet and go outside!”
## DEV:
Oof. 
## YAEL:
I went into the dressing room with her. She threw a fit.
And I’m like, you think I’m bad? Imagine doing this with Grandma like Aunt ## DEV: / and I did!
## VALERIA: grunts (I wasn’t as bad as your Nonna!).
## DEV:
Remember? I used to stuff my bras with socks.
## YAEL:
And I used to pull them out.
## DEV:
At Hebrew school.
## YAEL:
Yeah sorry.
## DEV:
We’d be learning like the Mi Chamocha or something and everyone would be like “look Jewlan lost her boobies! Jewlan lost her boobies!”
## YAEL:
Jewlan?
## DEV:
You don’t remember?
## YAEL:
...
## DEV:
That’s what everyone at Hebrew school used to call me. Like Mulan. But Jew-Lan.

You’re right. I’m sorry.
A beat.
## YAEL:
I did just teach her about the Shoah.
## DEV:
Oh?
## YAEL:
Yeah, she started studying World War 2 in history class. They kind of skirt around it.
## DEV:
Even at Saint Mary’s?
## YAEL:
Yup.
And she must have told Maya because now Maya’s afraid to go in the shower. 
dev
Did that ever happen to you?
## VALERIA: grunts (I used to have to go in the shower with her.)
## YAEL:
Oh my gosh, right.
## DEV:
My first memory is being in the gas chambers.
## YAEL:
What?
## DEV:
Yeah. I mean, obviously not. But, like, my first memory is of a series of recurring nightmares I had when I was little where I was in Auschwitz.
## YAEL:
Wait. Oh my gosh me too. I used to have Holocaust dreams all the time.
## DEV:
Seriously?
yael
Yeah. There’s this one where I was in the shower room and gas started coming out, and I tried to scream and nothing came out of my mouth.
## DEV:
I had this one once, I think I was maybe 11 or 12 or something, where you and I had to dig Nonno’s grave. Like the Nazis were yelling at us, and we had to dig his grave to shoot him into.
## VALERIA: grunts (Non fatte le noiose, girls!).
yael
Did you ever have the one where you’re running over the Italian border, and you / trip?
dev
Trip? OhmygodYES.
## YAEL:
Sometimes they’re doing selections. And I lie and tell them I’m someone else. And they take the fake ## YAEL: away to the showers.
## DEV:
Woah. That’s dark, sis.
A beat.
## DEV:
Did you see? The last Shoah survivor just...
## YAEL:
I know.
A beat. A long one. This should land.
## DEV:
I thought you were such a prick for making Nonna record all her stories, but...
## YAEL:
I was kind of a prick.
## DEV:
But now you can show them to the girls. Instead of whatever bullshit they’re learning at Saint Mary’s.
## YAEL:
It’s better than what they teach in public school. You know, two sides to the Holocaust and two sides to slavery and two sides to like Japanese / internment and
## DEV:
Exactly. Thank God you have those recordings.
## YAEL:
Yeah, but they’re just kids.
## DEV:
So were we.
## YAEL:
And look how we turned / out ha
## DEV:
At least we know where we come from. 
A knock on the door. 
## YAEL:
Who is that? Shit!
The knocking continues. ## YAEL: panics. She quickly and automatically hides the Seder plate and Jewish items, including the screen upon which they were reading their mothers’ thoughts.
dev
What are you doing?
yael
Oh my god don’t be a martyr.
## DEV:
I’m not.
## YAEL:
So help me!
## VALERIA: grunts.
## DEV:
We don’t need to do this anymore. No one’s gonna / raid our
## YAEL:
I have two daughters, ## DEV:. You know I can’t be found with this / [stuff]
## DEV:
Yes, that’s clear.
More knocking.
## YAEL:
You didn’t put the Mezuzah back on the door, did you?
DeV
Of course I did! 
## YAEL:
Seriously? Even after they ransacked your house?
## DEV:
Yes. I should answer. Just [leave it be].
## DEV: exits the room to answer the door. ## YAEL: continues to cover up the Jewish items. 
## VALERIA: grunts.
YaeL
I’m sure it’s nothing. Don’t worry.
After a moment, ## DEV: returns.
## DEV:
Just a package. Mom’s meds.
## YAEL:
Oh.
## YAEL: breathes a sigh of relief. 
## YAEL:
Sorry. I didn’t mean to [freak out]. Habit.
## VALERIA: sticks out her tongue and waves it around.
## YAEL:
What is she / doing?
## DEV:
More?
## VALERIA: gives a thumbs up.
## DEV: grabs a can of Diet Coke and feeds it to ## VALERIA: through a straw.
## YAEL:
Seriously?
## DEV:
That’s what the tongue means.
## YAEL:
Testa dura. It’s going to rot / her teeth
## DEV:
Really?
## YAEL:
You’re right. Sorry.
## YAEL: feeds the diet coke to ## VALERIA: and strokes her hair. ## DEV: wipes ## VALERIA:’s bib. A tender moment. They calm down.
## YAEL:
That brisket was mmm so good. I’m stuffed.
dev
I was trying Mom’s old recipe. I remember she made it in 2019, you know, before the... It was Nonno and Nonna’s last...
## YAEL:
Right, I loved that brisket.
## DEV:
You didn’t eat that brisket.
## YAEL:
What? Yes I did.
## VALERIA: grunts.
## DEV:
Weren’t you a vegan or like a pescatarian or something like / that
## YAEL:
No I wasn’t.
## DEV:
Oh. I thought/
## YAEL:
No. That was my partner in college. Nate Moore.
## DEV:
Oh right. Nate Moore.
I didn’t like him.
## YAEL:
You never liked my partners.
## DEV:
Yeah well Miguel, can you blame me?
## YAEL:
Well.
## VALERIA: grunts.
## DEV:
You never liked mine either.
## YAEL:
Yes I did. I liked Rachel.
## DEV:
Rachel was like seven years ago, Yaya.
And she cheated on me.
## YAEL:
Oh. I didn’t-
Sorry.
## DEV:
It’s fine. It was a long time ago.
## YAEL:
Well. Is there someone I should not like now?
## DEV:
Nope. No one.
Between Mom and the synagogue, it’s like...
## YAEL:
Yeah.
## DEV:
There are 50 new families this year.
## YAEL:
Wow. You would think after...
## DEV:
I know, but when Temple Sinai and Wilshire Boulevard folded, we got most of their congregants.
## YAEL:
It’s because you’re Head Rabbi.
## DEV:
I’m sure that’s / not
## YAEL:
Nonno would be so proud.
## DEV:
You think?
## VALERIA: gives a thumbs up.
## YAEL:
Yeah.
A beat.
## DEV:
He would want his great-granddaughter to have a Bat-/ Mitzvah
## YAEL:
Seriously? I thought you were gonna drop it.
## DEV:
I know, I am.
I’m just saying, Zoey and Maya will probably be the only/
## YAEL:
Don’t say that. 
You could get off the adoption waitlist soon.
## DEV:
Ha!
## YAEL:
Stephanie, another doctor at the hospital, she waited for six years.
## DEV:
Is Stephanie a Chinese Jewish lesbian Rabbi? I had no idea there was another one! 
## YAEL:
The ban lifted two years ago.
## DEV:
No I know.
Anyway, I reserved Zoey a slot. March 2052.
## YAEL:
I don’t know. We’ll see.
## DEV:
She needs to have a Bat-Mitzvah, Yaya.
## VALERIA: grunts.
## YAEL:
You know she can’t speak Hebrew.
## DEV:
I’ll teach her!
## YAEL:
I’d need to talk to Miguel.
## DEV:
Screw Miguel.
## YAEL:
He’s scared. After what he’s been through, he has a right to be/
## DEV:
The synagogue is a fortress. There’s a huge wall covered in barbed wire, face recognition security at every entrance, and armed guards and metal detectors lining the Sanctuary and Social Hall.
## YAEL:
Exactly! I don’t want a 12-year-old having to go through all that just to learn some stupid language.
## DEV:
Stupid? Really?
## YAEL:
I didn’t mean / that
## DEV:
Yes you did. 
## VALERIA: grunts.
## YAEL:
Look. It’s one thing if you want to have [Jewish] stuff all over your house, but/
## DEV:
You can say “Jewish.” It’s not like Voldemort. It’s not a bad word.
## YAEL:
Ohmygod that’s not what I was/
## DEV:
You used to think you were such an activist.
## YAEL:
I’m still an/
## DEV:
How?
## YAEL:
What?
## DEV:
Tell me. How are you still an activist? 
## YAEL:
Do we have to do this right now?
## DEV:
I’m just asking.
## YAEL:
I’m keeping my children alive. Protecting them is my / activism.
## DEV:
You don’t hide who you are. That’s what being an activist is. You don’t disappear. 
I can’t! I can’t just... pass. So you are supposed to stand up for/ 
## YAEL:
OK so I’m a bad Jew. Sue me.
## VALERIA: grunts.
## DEV:
Are you even listening to me? That’s not what I was saying. It’s not about whether you’re a good Jew or a bad / Jew
## YAEL:
Yes it is. You’re this like super Jew/
## DEV:
Oh / come on
## YAEL:
You’re this super Jew and I’m like this outsider. You’re in, I’m out. And fine, whatever. / I’m allowed
## DEV:
There’s literally thousands of years of Judaism in your literal blood.
## YAEL:
Don’t make this about/
## DEV:
You can’t call yourself an outsider. You can’t.
## YAEL:
Ok. Whatever. I’m not an outsider, but I’m not like, like Moses.
## DEV:
What?
## YAEL:
Leading our people out of shootings and cross burnings and University quotas into some like better world.
## DEV:
You think that’s what I’m doing?
## YAEL:
And that’s good. Really. I’m proud of you. But that’s not the life I chose.
## DEV:
I’m just trying to give hope, like help people survive this, so that their children don’t have to freak out whenever there’s a knock on the door. So they can have a Bat-Mitzvah.
## VALERIA: grunts.
## YAEL:
You sound like Dad: “today I helped bring people closer to God, ## YAEL:, what did you do with your day?”
## DEV:
Don’t make this about/
## YAEL:
I’m just saying like being super Jew always came first, before Mom, before us, and this was before he ran off with what’s-her-name, president of the sisterhood/
## DEV:
So you’re abandoning your people because our father left us?
## YAEL:
Don’t exaggerate! I am NOT “abandoning” / our
## DEV:
Even Mom started to daven again after she lost her job.
## VALERIA: grunts.
## YAEL:
And whose fault is that?
## DEV:
What are you saying?
## YAEL:
You don’t think your “activism” is the reason she was fired?
## DEV:
They fired Jewish professors all over the country, Yaya.
## YAEL:
Ok. Then what about my daughter?
## DEV:
I thought we weren’t going to get into this.
## YAEL:
I just... you haven’t changed. Even after you put Zoey in danger/
## DEV:
I would never put my niece in / danger
## YAEL:
They knew she was Jewish because of the picture of the two of you online. You know that.
And I thought after all these years, you would have understood. 
## DEV:
I do understand! I told you a million times. I understand why you were scared. That’s human. I said I wouldn’t be with the girls in public anymore.
## YAEL:
That’s not / what I was
dev
I wasn’t the one that cut off all communication after that, Yaya. You did the same thing with Dad. When things get tough, you just BAM, shut people out of your life.
## YAEL:
To protect my family! 
## DEV:
Oh come on. I’m not the bad guy here.
## YAEL:
No. Just the martyr.
## VALERIA: grunts.
## DEV:
In Auschwitz, Nonno gave his food to the younger boys. 
It’s the least we can do.
## YAEL:
I’m not Nonno! I can’t be Nonno!
## DEV:
But you can. That’s what I’m saying! It’s a choice.
## YAEL:
I have kids, ## DEV:. I don’t get a choice.
## DEV:
Yes you do.
## YAEL:
What would you / know about 
## DEV:
I choose to put on this Kippah, Yaya, when I walk outside. But even if I didn’t, everyone still sees-
(she motions at herself)
I don’t get a choice.
## YAEL:
You’re right. / I’m sorry. That’s not what
## DEV:
And you don’t have to think twice about holding your partner’s hand in public. I do. I have to. But I still choose to do it. And I still choose to put on a Kippah. Because this is who I am.
## YAEL:
You’re a better person than me, ok? Is that what you want me to say?
## DEV:
No! I just want / you to
## YAEL:
Stop. Can we please just.
The girls were so happy we were talking again. Mom was so happy we were talking again.
## DEV:
So am I!
## YAEL:
Really?
## DEV:
Of course! 
## YAEL:
Because we’re together again or because I’m the one taking Mom to the hospital so you can go off and lead another synagogue vigil?
## DEV:
That is so unfair. 
You only started talking to me again when Mom got sick.
## VALERIA: grunts.
## DEV:
And those vigils are important. Our community needs healing.
## YAEL:
I know, that’s not / what I was-
## DEV:
Most of our people either moved to Israel or 
(indicating ## YAEL:)
Erased any semblance of who they are.
## YAEL:
/ Seriously?
## VALERIA: grunts.
## DEV:
We have to survive this somehow.
## YAEL:
Stop. Just stop, please. 
## DEV:
And things are finally getting back to normal. Your children have a real chance to grow up with all the joyful parts of Judaism, without fear / and hate
## YAEL:
I’m their mother! You’re not their... 
You could have kids and raise them your own way.
## DEV:
Well I’m not going to.
## YAEL:
What?
## DEV:
I took my name off the adoption list.
## VALERIA: grunts.
YaeL
Wait what?
## DEV:
Yeah. A few weeks ago. 
At Dad’s funeral, I was just like thinking about our life growing up, how much he missed, and/
## YAEL:
You wouldn’t be like him/
## DEV:
You don’t know that. Plus all the death threats, it was just too...
## YAEL:
Oh ## DEV:.
## DEV:
But now you have a responsibility to raise your children/
## YAEL:
I’m sorry ## DEV:, but you can’t use my children as if they’re the last hope of the Jewish people, that’s completely / and ridiculously out of line!
## DEV:
But you have to face reality, Yaya! You can’t just la di da hide your head under the sand and hope / that
## VALERIA: bangs her hands on the table in anger. 
Everyone shuts up. Silence.
## VALERIA: grunts again.
## YAEL:
Shoot, we didn’t check Ma’s thingy. The thought-to-text / thingy.
## DEV:
Where’s the screen? I thought it was right here.
## YAEL:
Oh God, I think I hid it with the Seder stuff.
## YAEL: takes back out the screen with the though-to-text app. 
## YAEL:
Sorry, Ma. We didn’t see. 
Here, we can look. What did you say?
They look at the screen. We see all of what ## VALERIA: was trying to communicate:
“I want the Diet Coke.” 
“Miguel è un bastardo.” 
“Rachel è una bastarda.” 
“Girls!” 
“Girls, please!” 
“Seriously, stop!” 
“Oh, don’t drag me into this!” 
“Girls, please, stop it.” 
“Seriously, girls, enough.” 
Next slide:
“Pretty soon, it will just be you girls. That’s it. You have to take care of each other. Please take care of each other.”
A long, long silence.
## DEV:
I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to/
## YAEL:
No. Me too. You know I....
## DEV:
I know.
## YAEL:
I don’t want to go another five years without...
## DEV:
Me neither. Really.
A long beat.
## DEV:
Should we finish the Seder?
## YAEL:
## DEV:, it’s getting late and/
## VALERIA: grunts (Please. I want to finish.)
## YAEL:
Ok, Ma. Let’s do it. What’s left?
## DEV:
Elijah. I’ll get the door. 
## DEV: gets up to the open the front door. She looks outside just to make sure no one’s listening. 
## YAEL:
(holding up Elijah’s cup)
Remember Nonno used to sneakily drink the cup of wine and then say, “Guess Elijah was thirsty?”
## VALERIA: grunts and gives a thumbs up (Yes! That was my favorite part of the Seder.)
## DEV: returns to the table.
## DEV:
Ready?
## YAEL: nods, but doesn’t sing along. ## VALERIA: bobs her head along and the lyrics to the prayer float up on the screen. 
## DEV:
(singing)
Eliyahu ha-navee
Eliyahu ha-Tish-bee
Eliyahu Eliyahu Eliyahu ha-Giladee
Beem-hei-ra b’ya-mei-nu
Yavo ei-leinu
Eem ma-shee-ach ben David
Eem ma-shee-ach ben David
Eliyahu ha-navee
Eliyahu ha-Tish-bee
Eliyahu Eliyahu Eliyahu ha-Giladee
## VALERIA: gives a thumbs up (Thank you.)
## YAEL:
Yeah, that was beautiful sis. Ok, I should really get going.
## DEV:
Give the girls a big kiss from me.
## YAEL:
I will.
## DEV:
I wanted to let you know. I’m leading a mission trip to Auschwitz next Spring.
## YAEL:
Oh. Wow.
## DEV:
Yeah, it’s the first trip to the Camps since the travel ban was lifted. 
If you want, you should bring the girls.
## YAEL:
I’ll think about it.
## DEV:
This isn’t me pushing. But for Maya and Zoey/
## YAEL:
Please, ## DEV:. 
## DEV:
It’s dangerous, not knowing where your family comes from. 
## YAEL:
## DEV:, it’s not the/
## DEV:
No I know.
But for your kids, for me, not knowing...
I’m not saying it’s worse than shootings and all this, but... I think it’s a kind of trauma too.
A beat. 
## YAEL:
When we were in China that summer and we went to the orphanage where you... you said it felt like a a dream. Like you got there and you were expecting it to, I don’t know... but it didn’t feel like home.
## DEV:
I was angry. I was 23 years old!
## YAEL:
Saying these prayers tonight, like Mah Nishtana, Eliyahu...
it’s like I know all the words, they’re so engrained-
But it’s just a foreign language.
## DEV:
Our people survived horrible, horrible things to be able to say those words.
## YAEL:
You sound like Nonna.
## DEV:
Well we did.
A beat.
## YAEL:
I’ll think about the trip. I will. 
Love you, Ma. I’ll see you tomorrow.
## YAEL: kisses ## VALERIA: on the cheek. 
## YAEL:
I didn’t think we would have to go through this again.
## DEV:
È la vita. 
## YAEL:
It’s nice Nonno and Nonna went together, you know? Just hours apart. I keep thinking about Mom... 
## DEV:
Yeah. I know.
## YAEL:
It just seems like every time we get a second to breathe...
## DEV:
It’s when we’re the most tired that God does her work.
## YAEL:
No ‘Rabbi ## DEV:’, / please.
## DEV:
I’m not trying to go all ‘sermon’ on you. 
But there were flowers in the desert!
It’s when we’re the most tired, just getting through to the next day, just surviving, that we can see the miracle. 
I’m trying to make a miracle.
## YAEL:
(## YAEL: points to ## VALERIA:)
What’s the miracle in this?
I’m trying to turn off my science brain. 
But tell me. 
What’s the miracle in this, ## DEV:?
A beat.
## DEV:
I don’t know yet.
## VALERIA: grunts (You are the miracle. You are my miracles.)
## YAEL: hugs ## DEV:.
## DEV:
Hey sis. L’shanah ha-ba-ah bee-Yeru-sha-layim. 
Next year in Jerusalem.
## YAEL:
Next year in Jerusalem.
## YAEL: exits. ## DEV: goes to clean up the table. She sees that somehow (magically?) Elijah’s cup of wine is empty. 
From faraway: the sound of a timbrel.
## DEV: holds the cup up to the light. ## VALERIA: smiles.
END OF PART THREE.
part 4: chag ha-pesach (the festival of passover)
Hundreds or thousands or tens of thousands of years ago. 40 years since the Exodus. Maybe 1406 BCE? 
The stage explodes. We’re suddenly in the desert of Sinai. We’re in a sacred time, a Biblical time. A time of miracles. 
Another warm evening in April. Another Passover Seder. 
Projection: April ~1406 BCE, 15th of Nissan ~2344. 40 years since the Exodus. Sinai Desert.
A group of Israelites [## PAOLA:, ## DAVIDE:, ## VALERIA:, ## DEV:, and ## YAEL:] sit on the floor in the desert of Sinai. 
Though they share the same names and the resemblance is uncanny, ## PAOLA:, ## DAVIDE:, ## VALERIA:, ## DEV:, and ## YAEL: are not themselves in the present. They are Israelites in the Sinai Desert. ## PAOLA: and ## DAVIDE: speak in unaccented English.
(This scene is spoken in English, but it’s really in Hebrew. Hebrew subtitles should be shown. Some of the text in this scene is taken directly from the Torah.)
Manna falls from the sky. ## DEV: gathers it in a basket. 
## DEV:
Hineni. Here I am.
## DEV: enters the tent, carrying a basket of Manna.
## YAEL:
Finally! I’m so hungry.
## DEV:
You’re always hungry.
## YAEL:
You’re always / mean.
davide
Girls, please! Be nice to each other.
## YAEL:
Sorry.
## DEV:
Sorry, Saba.
## VALERIA: gives everyone a portion of Manna.
## VALERIA:
B’tay-a-vone.
They begin eating.
## YAEL:
Ughhh I’m so sick of Manna.
paola
Well, it’s your last night.
## YAEL:
Yes!
(chanting)
Last night of Manna!
## YAEL: and dEV
(chanting)
Last night of Manna! Last night of Manna!
## DAVIDE: takes ## PAOLA:’s hand.
## DEV:
What’s wrong, Safta?
## PAOLA:
Nothing, my joy.
## YAEL:
What kind of food will there be in the Promised Land?
davide
Oh, watermelon and pomegranates and grapes and olives and milk and honey. Up to your ears!
yael
What does watermelon taste like?
davide
Like dancing naked on a hot day.
## PAOLA:
/ Ooh!
yael
What does dancing naked on a hot day taste like?
davide
Like the memory of a memory.

## DEV:
I can’t believe we’re going to be in Jerusalem tomorrow.
## VALERIA:
Probably not tomorrow, hon. It might take a little while for Joshua and the army to get through Jericho. 
## DEV:
Fine, well then by next year.
## YAEL:
Next year in Jerusalem!
## DEV:
Next year in Jerusalem!
## DAVIDE: takes ## PAOLA:’s hand.
## DEV:
Is it true the people are the size of giants?
## YAEL:
Giants?
## DEV:
Joshua said we’re grasshoppers compared to them!
paola
Oh, Joshua’s handsome.
## DAVIDE:
And a Rabbi!
valeria
Abba! Joshua’s too old for / her.
yael
I want to marry Moses’ son.
paola
Moses’ son? You should marry a Jew.
## DEV:
He is Jewish!
paola
His mother is a Midianite.
valeria
Eema!
## PAOLA:
What? She is. Tzipporah. What kind of a goyischa name / is that?
dev
Safta, Shhhhhhh. You’ll get leprosy. Like God gave Miriam.
paola
It’s ok. God doesn’t listen to me anyway.
dev
God listens to everyone.
paola
Oh, to be young and forgetful.
## YAEL:
What’s the first thing you’re going to do in Canaan, Safta?
A beat.
## PAOLA: looks at ## VALERIA: and ## DAVIDE:.
## DEV:
What’s going on?
## PAOLA:
Nothing, my treasures. 
## DEV:
Then what’s the first thing you’re going to do in Canaan?
No response.
## DEV:
See? What’s going / on?
## VALERIA:
We have to tell them.
## PAOLA:
## VALERIA:!
## YAEL:
Tell us what?
## DEV:
You’re coming with us, right?
A beat.
## DAVIDE:
No, carina. We’re not.
## YAEL:
What? You have to come! 
## DEV:
Yes, we won’t go without you!
## PAOLA: and ## DAVIDE: speak once again in their accents. The accents should start out light and grow heavier as the scene progresses.
davide
Even if we could, gioia, we’re not allowed. Neither is Moses.
## DEV:
Why?
## PAOLA:
We were born in Egypt. Freedom is for the young, not the old.
## YAEL:
What do you mean? We’re free now.
## PAOLA:
We’re wandering, that’s not free.
yael
I don’t understand.
## PAOLA:
Do we look like we can fight off the Amalekites? The Hittites? The Jebusites? The Amorites? The Giants? 
yael
But don’t you want to have a watermelon, Nonno?
davide
I have de memory. Dayeinu.
## YAEL:
Mom, you have to talk to them.
## VALERIA: looks at her parents. 
yael
What?
## VALERIA:
I was born in Egypt too. 
I can’t come to the Promised Land either.
dev
What? No! You have to come!
## YAEL:
Yes, we’ll sneak you in! 
## VALERIA:
Hon, I can’t. You don’t think I want to watch you girls grow up? Of course I do. More than...
But I can’t.
## YAEL:
But it’s not fair!
## VALERIA:
Sometimes people leave you, hon. And it’s not fair. Sometimes it’s just about making it through the day, getting out of bed. 
## YAEL:
But I want to stay with you! I don’t want to go anymore.
valeria
## YAEL:/
## YAEL:
What? We’re probably not going to make it there anyway. 
## PAOLA:
Non fare la noiosa/
## YAEL:
And even if we do, the Amalekites don’t want us. They’ll kill us off or burn down our houses or fire us from our jobs or give our children black eyes / or 
dev
But Yaya, we have to try.
## YAEL:
Why?
## DEV:
Where else are we going to go?
## VALERIA: wraps her daughters in a hug.
## VALERIA:
You’re ready. You don’t need us to take care of you anymore. 
## YAEL:
At least we won’t be alone.
## VALERIA:
That’s right. It’s time for you to take care of each other. 
Please take care of each other. 
A beat.
## YAEL:
What are we supposed to do?
## DAVIDE:
You tell the story of how we got here. You remember. 
So when you are free, you can tell your children and your children’s children and deir children. So dey will remember de story. So dey will remember us. Dat’s how you keep going, gioia.

## DEV:
(taking her sister’s hand)
Then tell us the story. From the beginning.
## PAOLA:
Ok.
Well as you know, we were slaves in Egypt for a long time. It was a hard, bitter life.
## DEV: pulls Maror out of the sand. 
## VALERIA:
What’s that?
## DEV:
Maror. So we can remember the bitterness of slavery.
## DEV: draws a circle in the sand (the shape of a Seder plate) and places the Maror on the Seder Plate.
## YAEL:
What are you doing?
## DEV:
I’m trying to make a miracle.
What happened next?
## PAOLA:
Well, one day, after Moses talked to God at de burning bush/
## DEV:
(I want to talk to God.)
## DAVIDE:
Ah, la nostra piccola Rabbina!
## PAOLA:
So Moses saw bush burning/
davide
Wait. We have to tell dem about de boy we lost. Before we got here. Before ## VALERIA:.
## PAOLA:
## DAVIDE:/
## DAVIDE:
We need to tell all parts, gioia. Good and bad.
(back to the story)
Pharaoh told all of us we had to kill de baby boys. Throw dem in the Nile.
## PAOLA:
Doctor say he no have chance.
## DAVIDE: takes ## PAOLA:’s hand.
## VALERIA:
But after a long time, Moses came back to Egypt to save us. And he said to Pharaoh: Let my people go! But Pharaoh said no.
## PAOLA:
So God brought down de ten plagues. 
## PAOLA:, davide, and valeria
Blood, frogs, / lice
yael and dev
Lice. We know.
## VALERIA: opens a can of diet coke and drinks it from a straw.
## PAOLA:
De final plague was de Death of the firstborn.
## DAVIDE:
We sacrificed a lamb and took de blood to put on our doors. 
## DEV: pulls a shankbone out of the sand and places it on the Seder plate.
## DAVIDE:
So dat God would not kill us. Only kill de oders. And Pharaoh’s son Judel died.
dev
Judel?
## PAOLA:
It was Ramses, tesoro mio.
## DAVIDE:
Oh, right. Ramses.
## YAEL:
Who was Judel?
## PAOLA:
Is ok. You no need to tell, gioia. We make nice story.
## DAVIDE:
No. Dey need to know. Is only way to be free.
## DAVIDE: pulls an egg out of the sand and places it on the Seder plate.
## DAVIDE:
For Judel. May his memory be a blessing.
They all look at ## DAVIDE:. Recognition.
dev
What happened next?
## VALERIA:
After the tenth plague, Pharaoh told us we could finally leave. But quickly!
## YAEL:
Wait. I want to record this. One sec. So we can remember.
## YAEL: takes out some kind of modern anachronistic voice recording device (the one we saw her use in Part One). She starts recording.
## PAOLA:
We gathered all of our stuff in a hurry and den we hurried down to de Sea. We didn’t even have enough time for our bread to rise. So we took it as it was. 
dev
Matzah!
## DEV: pulls a piece of Matzah out of the sand and places it on the Seder plate.
## PAOLA:
Esattamente.
Now at dis point, Pharaoh had change of heart. Il bastardo. So an army of Germans-
## YAEL:
Egyptians, Nonna.
## PAOLA:
Right, Egyptians. 
Dey followed us down to de water. We no know what to do. But your Nonno was brave man, he starts walking into de water.
## DAVIDE:
No, no brave.
## PAOLA:
Yes brave, gioia. 
You are best person I ever know, ## DAVIDE:.
## DAVIDE:
Tesoro mio.
## PAOLA:
Sempre e per sempre.
So de water came up to his ankles, den his knees, den his waist, his chest, his neck. Finally, his head. And at de very moment when he was about to drown, de seas split. And we walked right through. 
And de seas closed and de Egyptians drowned behind us.
And den Miriam starts singing. 
And dancing with a timbrel.
And we all join her. 
All de women. 
Singing and crying and dancing. 
Your Mama on my back. 
(singing)
Mi Chamocha-
## PAOLA: tries to sing, but it’s too hard. 
## DEV:
I can do it, Nonna. It’s our turn.
(singing)
Mi Chamocha Ba’elim Adonai
Mi Kamocha Ne’edar BaKodesh
Nora t’hilot/
## YAEL: joins in.
## DEV: and yael
Oseh feleh?
Nora t’hilot, oseh feleh?
~
We break in reality. The Levi-Katz family starts singing and dancing with timbrels, which have now appeared. 
It is the past and the present and the future.
Slowly, over the course of the song and dance, flowers start blooming everywhere - seemingly out of thin air. They’re cherry blossoms.

Mi Chamocha Ba’elim Adonai
Mi Kamocha Ne’edar BaKodesh
