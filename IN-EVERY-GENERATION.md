part 1: chag ha-matzot (the festival of unleavened bread)
---
2019. An old home in the Westwood neighborhood of Los Angeles, California.
---
The dining room table is set for a Passover Seder. A warm evening in April.
---
Projection: April 2019, 15th of Nissan 5779 (the date in English and Hebrew). Los Angeles, CA.
---
Dev (23), Yael (19), Valeria (57), Davide (87), and Paola (85) sit around the table. Davide sits in a wheelchair. He no longer has the ability to speak.
---
## DEV:
Hineni.
---
## YAEL:
Hineni.
---
## DEV:
Sorry/
---
## YAEL:
No, go ahead.
---
## DEV:
(reading from Haggadah)
---
Hineni, Here I am, ready to perform the mitzvah of retelling the story of the Exodus from Egypt.
---
Dev indicates for her sister to continue reading. Yael removes the cover from the matzah, and raises the broken half of the matzah.
---
## YAEL:
(reading from Haggadah)
---
This is the bread of affliction that our ancestors ate in the land of Egypt. As it says in the Torah, "seven days shall you eat matzot - the bread of poverty and persecution" so that you may "remember that you were a slave in Egypt." Let all who are hungry, come and eat. Let all who are in need, come and share the Pesach meal. This year we are still here - Next year, in the land of Israel. This year we are still slaves - Next year, free people.
---
Davide grunts.
---
## PAOLA:
Pulisciti la faccia, tesoro mio.
---
Paola wipes Davide's mouth on his bib.
---
## VALERIA:
Come ti senti, papá?
---
Davide gives a thumbs up.
---
## PAOLA:
I should check his feeding thingy.
---
## DEV:
It's ok. I got it.
---
Dev fusses with the feeding tube.
---
## PAOLA:
Andiamo! Nonno non può stare / a lungo.
---
## VALERIA:
English, / Ma!
---
## YAEL:
It's OK. Sto imparando.
---
## PAOLA:
Bravissima, carina! A Yale?
---
## YAEL:
Sì.
---
## DEV:
What?
---
## YAEL:
I'm, um, I'm studying Italian.
---
## PAOLA:
Have you decided on a major?
---
## YAEL:
Biology, or pre-med, I think.
---
## PAOLA:
Brava! Hai sentito, Davide? Una dottoressa?
---
Davide gives a thumbs up. Paola kisses him on the cheek.
---
## VALERIA:
Cazzo! I forgot your laundry.
---
## YAEL:
It's fine. Don't worry.
---
## PAOLA:
Valeria! Bada a come parli!
---
## VALERIA:
We only get you for a week, I wanna do your laundry.
---
## YAEL:
Mom, it's fine.
---
## PAOLA:
Allora, andiamo.
---
## DEV:
It's the Mah Nishtana. The Four Questions.
---
Everyone looks at Yael expectantly.
---
## YAEL:
Oh come on, I've been doing it forever.
---
## VALERIA:
You're still the baby, hon.
---
## YAEL:
Can't Dev / sing it
---
## DEV:
No, it's not / my
---
## VALERIA:
Yael, you do it tonight, Dev can do it tomorrow.
---
## DEV:
We're, um, we're going to Dad's tomorrow.
---
## VALERIA:
Oh, I see.
---
## YAEL:
What?
---
## DEV:
Yeah, he invited us to the synagogue with "Margot."
---
## YAEL:
What? No! I'm not going back there! We always do/
---
## VALERIA:
Great! I can watch Dancing with the Stars.
---
## PAOLA:
Andiamo!
---
## VALERIA:
(whispering)
---
We'll discuss this later. Nonno needs to / get home.
---
## YAEL:
Fine.
---
Yael stands on her chair. While Yael sings, Paola takes Davide's hands and claps them in rhythm to the song.
---
## YAEL:
(singing)
---
Mah nishtanah halailah hazeh mikol haleilot?
 Mikol haleilot?
 Sheb'khol haleilot anu okhlin

---
Uh (shoot. How does it...)
---
(singing)
---
Sheb'khol haleilot (da da da da)
---
## DEV:
(singing)
---
Ein anu matbilin/
---
## YAEL:
I got it.
---
## DEV:
I was just trying to help!
---
## VALERIA:
Girls!
---
Yaya, continue.
---
## YAEL:
(singing)
---
Sheb'khol haleilot _ein anu matbilin_
---

---
halailah hazeh, halailah hazeh, shtei f'amim.
---
(speeds up the singing, to get it over with)
---
halailah hazeh, halailah hazeh, shtei f'amim.
---
Davide coughs. Paola tends to him.
---
## YAEL:

Dev pokes Yael. Yael pokes back.

## YAEL:
(singing quickly)
---
halailah hazeh, halailah hazeh, kulanu m'subin.
---
halailah hazeh, halailah hazeh, kulanu m'subin.
---
## PAOLA:
Why four questions?
---
## YAEL:
What?
---
## PAOLA:
Why not 50 or a hundred?
---
## VALERIA:
Do you want to be here / all night?
---
## PAOLA:
No. I'm just saying I have about a thousand questions I'd like to ask God, you know, if He has the / time.
---
## DEV:
Four is a mystical number in Judaism. In Passover, you know, there are the four questions. The four sons. Four cups of wine. It symbolizes wholeness. Which can only come from experiencing both slavery and freedom at the same time.
---
## PAOLA:
Ooh! We have a little Rabbi over here.
---
Davide grunts.
---
## PAOLA:
Come / va?
---
## YAEL:
What's next?
---
## DEV:
We haven't decided. I mean, Dad would always do the/
---
## VALERIA:
Let's sing a song!
---
## YAEL:
Ok. What song?
---
## DEV:
How about the Mi Chamocha?
---
## VALERIA:
Too much Hebrew.
---
## YAEL:
Yeah no
---
## VALERIA:
Let's sing "Go Down Moses"!
---
## YAEL:
It's cultural appropriation, Ma.
---
It's a spiritual.
---
## PAOLA:
It's about Moses.
---
## YAEL:
It's about _slavery_.
---
## PAOLA:
We were slaves too!
---
## YAEL:
Like hundreds of thousands / of years ago
---
## VALERIA:
Enough! Never mind. Forget I asked.
---
A beat.
---
## PAOLA:
Allora, si può mangiare adesso? Can we eat?
---
## DEV:
We're not done telling the story.
---
## PAOLA:
What else is there? They tried to kills us. They didn't. Let's eat.
---
## DEV:
Just a few more minutes.
---
Um. I guess I'll go?
---
Next is the ten plagues.
---
(reading)
---
"As we prepare to spill wine from our cup at the mention of each plague, we recall the sentence from the Torah, 'Rejoice not when your enemy / falls.'"
---
## PAOLA:
Ha!
---
## VALERIA:
Ma!
---
## PAOLA:
Che? Abbiamo fatto festa quando hanno ucciso Eichmann./
---
## DEV:
What?
---
## VALERIA:
Ma, don't.
---
## PAOLA:
We threw a party when they killed / Eichmann.
---
## YAEL:
Nonna!
---
## VALERIA:
Dev, continue.
---
## DEV:
Ok, uh.
---
(reading)
---
"Our Rabbis taught that when the children of Israel sang songs of praise to God as the Egyptians drowned in the sea, the angels wished to join in these songs and were stopped by God who said, 'These are my creatures who are drowning in the sea! For this you would sing songs of praise?' And so we diminish this cup of joy, for our redemption had to come through the destruction of others."
---
You know this was only invented in 1947 or something.
---
## VALERIA:
What?
---
## DEV:
Yeah, the dipping our finger in wine. 'Diminishing our cup of joy.' It's from a Reform Rabbi in America, like 70 years ago or whatever.
---
## YAEL:
Did Dad tell / you that?
---
## DEV:
No, just like...
---
I think back in the day it was all about like, like not getting killed.
---
And like hiding from the Romans and the Cosacks/
---
## PAOLA:
And the Germans./
---
## DEV:
Yeah, we didn't have time to cry over our oppressors' suffering.
---
## PAOLA:
Amen.
---
## YAEL:
But here we're not... I mean, we're free.
---
## PAOLA:
...
---
We're not free.
---
## VALERIA:
Ma!
---
## YAEL:
In America?
---
## PAOLA:
Did you see on the news? They desecrated another Jewish cemetery in Chicago. I'm not very smart, but I believe that's _in America._
---
## YAEL:
Yes, but/
---
## PAOLA:
And the neo-Nazis marching at that college / in Virginia
---
## YAEL:
Nonna, that was a symptom / of another
---
## DEV:
And the two synagogue SHOOTINGS. One was just two hours away, Yaya/
---
## YAEL:
Ok fine, you're right. Not 'free' or whatever, but not like in immediate, like Egyptians are chasing after us, kind of danger.
---
## DEV:
Tell that to the people / in Pittsburgh and Poway
---
## VALERIA:
Girls, please!/
---
## PAOLA:
Ah, essere giovani e spensierati!
---
## DEV:
What?
---
## YAEL:
To be young and...
---
## PAOLA:
Forgetful.

## YAEL:
I'm not / being-
---
## VALERIA:
Let's hit 'pause' until dinner, OK? Nonno.
---
## PAOLA:
Certo.
---
## YAEL:
Fine.

## DEV:
My drops are perfectly in line.
---
## PAOLA:
È tradizione!
---
## YAEL:
I made a pattern.
---
## DEV:
What? A giant blob / pattern

## YAEL:
It's a flower not a BLOB/

---
## YAEL:
Sorry, / Nonna.
---
## DEV:
Sorry.
---
## PAOLA:
You know it was Passover 1943 when they were taken from me.
---
## DEV:
I thought it was Yom Kippur 1943.
---
## YAEL:
Yeah.
---
## VALERIA:
Girls!
---
Dev and Yael share a look of affection- Nonna always changes her war story.
---
## VALERIA:
Dev, let's just keep going.
---
## DEV:
Sure... Um.
---
The lights swirl and shift.
---
~
---
Dev stands in the Sinai desert, hundreds or thousands or tens of thousands of years ago. From faraway: the sound of a timbrel.
---
## DEV:
B'khol dor v'dor chayav adam li'roat et atzmo, k'ilu who yatzah mi mitzraim.
---
In every generation one is obligated to see oneself as one who personally went out from Egypt.
---
In the background, we hear quiet singing: "Mi Chamocha Ba'elim Adonai, Mi Kamocha Ne'edar BaKodesh..."
---
~
---
Back to the present.
---
## VALERIA:
Hallelujah! Dinner time!
---
## PAOLA:
Grazie a dio! It's a miracle!
---
Davide gives a thumbs down.
---
## PAOLA:
Ti ho detto di non farlo, tesoro mio.
---
## VALERIA:
Dev, a little help?
---
Valeria and Dev exit to the kitchen to get the food.
---
## YAEL:
So how's he doing?
---
## PAOLA:
Oh, you know. É la vita.
---
But tell me, tell me. How's Yale?
---
## YAEL:
Bene, bene.
---
## PAOLA:
Bravissima. Nonno sarebbe così orgoglioso.
---
## YAEL:
Orgoloso?
---
## PAOLA:
(teaching her, moving Yael's lips)
---
Orgoglioso.
---
It means proud, gioia.
---
## YAEL:
I wish you would have spoken Italian to us growing up.
---
## PAOLA:
It must have skipped a generation. Your mother, she doesn't like to speak it too much.
---
## YAEL:
Well, io amo la lingua.
---
## PAOLA:
Perfetto, gioia.
---
So
---
...
---
are you seeing anyone?
---
## YAEL:
Nonna!
---
## PAOLA:
What? Am I not allowed to ask?
---
## YAEL:
No, it's...
---
Um
---
yes, actually.
---
## PAOLA:
Ah, brava! Who?
---
## YAEL:
His name is, um, Nate.
---
## PAOLA:
Nate. Hmm. È un ebreo?
---
Valeria and Dev enter with the first course: matzoh ball soup. Valeria's also carrying a can of Diet Coke.
---
## PAOLA:
Valeria!
---
## YAEL:
Seriously, Ma?
---
## VALERIA:
What?
---
## YAEL:
I thought you were going to stop.
---
## DEV:
Yaya, chill. It's just soda/
---
## VALERIA:
_Diet_ soda. Zero / calories.
---
## YAEL:
It still rots your teeth.
---
## VALERIA:
So let them rot.
---
## PAOLA:
Ma è Pasqua, Valeria! You're not supposed to drink Diet / Coke.
---
## VALERIA:
Can we go one day without picking apart everything I do?
---
## YAEL:
Sorry.
---
A beat.
---
## VALERIA:
Do you think Dad can drink it? Not the matzoh ball, but the soup?
---
Davide gives a thumbs up.
---
## DEV:
Here, let's try.
---
## PAOLA:
Wait, did you unclog / the
---
## DEV:
Yes, this morning.
---
## YAEL:
What?
---
## DEV:
His feeding tube.
---
## YAEL:
How do you know how to do that?
---
## DEV:
I'm getting some nursing certification. Just online.
---
Dev spoons Matzoh ball soup into Davide's mouth. He slurps it up.
---
## PAOLA:
Brava!
---
## YAEL:
Oh wow, that's/
---
## VALERIA:
Dev's been over there every day.
---
## DEV:
Right, Nonno? We're having fun together?
---
Davide points to his eye, then rubs his heart, then points at Dev (signaling 'I love you.') Dev does the same gesture back.
---
## PAOLA:
O tesoro mio. It's your Nonno's greatest joy.
---
Yael has visible FOMO. Dev clocks this.
---
## DEV:
Yeah, we've been spending a lot of time together. Bro-ing out.
---
Right, Nonno? "Bro-ing?"
---
Davide chuckles, which sounds like a grunt.
---
Dev tries again to feed him soup. He starts coughing. It gets all over his bib.
---
## PAOLA:
Va bene, basta.
---
Everyone begins eating their soup.
---
## YAEL:
Is it vegetarian, Ma?
---
## VALERIA:
Yours is.
---
## YAEL:
Thank / you.
---
## DEV:
You're a vegetarian?
---
## YAEL:
Vegan, yeah, for the last few / months.
---
## DEV:
Vegan?
---
## PAOLA:
Vegan? What do you eat?
---
## YAEL:
There's a whole vegan section in the Yale / dining hall.
---
## PAOLA:
There's not even a word for 'vegan' in Italian, I don't think. C'è vegetariana, / ma non so
---
## YAEL:
/ Vegano
---
## DEV:
Why did you decide to become / a vegan?
---
## YAEL:
Don't you know how terrible the meat and dairy industry is for the environment? I read the Jonathan Safran Foer book, "Eating Animals." And if we don't do / something, the
---
## PAOLA:
You've become a little activist!
---
## VALERIA:
Everyone's an activist in college.
---
## PAOLA:
You weren't.
---
## VALERIA:
You made me live at home! I didn't have time to be an activist.
---
## YAEL:
There's always time. It's the world that's running out / of time.
---
## PAOLA:
Your Nonno was an activist too.
---
## YAEL:
Really?
---
## PAOLA:
Oh sure. He used to march all the time. Any cause, your Nonno was there. He even smuggled prayer books into the Soviet Union in the 1980s.
---
## YAEL:
Oh wow, I had no / idea
---
## VALERIA:
And during the war, he always split his rations with the younger boys. What was his name? Judel, I think. Right, Dad?
---
Davide grunts.
---
## YAEL:
I've been meaning to ask, Nonna, if I could- I mean, if you wanted to...
---
if I could record some of your stories, before...
---
## PAOLA:
Before I die?
---
## VALERIA:
Ma, non fare la noiosa!
---
## PAOLA:
Va bene, any day now I'll be the one with the catheter.
---
## DEV:
Nonna!
---
## PAOLA:
What? È la vita.
---
## YAEL:
No, that's not why I wanted to...
---
Yael takes out a recording device.
---
## DEV:
You're seriously gonna do this at Seder?/
---
## YAEL:
It's just, in one of my classes this semester, we're studying epigenetics. You know what that is?
---
## PAOLA:
Do I look like Einstein?
---
## VALERIA:
Well, you do have the / [hair]
---
## PAOLA:
Never mind, don't answer that.
---
## YAEL:
Well, it's like how the expression of your genes can change and be passed down based on situational factors. So a few years ago they did this study on mice at Emory. They trained male mice to fear the smell of cherry blossoms by pairing the smell with a small electric shock.
---
## PAOLA:
Poverini!
---
## YAEL:
Then they took the sperm from these mice and used it to inseminate female mice. And the baby and even the grandbaby mice, who never in their lives smelled cherry blossom, they had the same fearful response to the smell. So, like, they actually inherited the trauma.
---
## VALERIA:
Wow, hon.
---
## YAEL:
Yeah. And so this Doctor in New York figured if it works on mice, it must be true for humans too. So she studied the progeny of Holocaust survivors and found that they're, like, predisposed to stress and anxiety disorders.
---
## VALERIA:
Makes sense.
---
## PAOLA:
Non dare la colpa a me per i tuoi / problemi!
---
## VALERIA:
Non / sono!
---
## DEV:
What are you saying??
---
## VALERIA:
Oh, sorry, hon. It's / nothing.
---
## YAEL:
Anyway, so I was thinking, like, if I could study my own DNA and pinpoint specific stressors or something, that would be really cool research.
---
## PAOLA:
La nostra piccola / dottoressa!
---
## DEV:
To see if you're like genetically oppressed?
---
## VALERIA:
/ Dev.
---
## YAEL:
No just like for research. I got that job in Professor Bradley's lab for the / summer so
---
## PAOLA:
Mazel Tov!
---
## YAEL:
Thanks, yeah, and I'll have access to all the equipment for my own research.
---
## VALERIA:
We're so proud of you, hon.
---
## YAEL:
Thanks!
---
## DEV:
You're going to be gone all summer?
---
## YAEL:
Yeah. I thought I told you that?
---
## DEV:
No.
---
## YAEL:
Anyway, yeah, I'll be in New Haven this summer. And maybe Mom when you come visit, I can test your DNA / too if-
---
## DEV:
You're going to New Haven?
---
## VALERIA:
I haven't booked anything yet.
---
## YAEL:
I thought you said you were going to come in July?
---
## VALERIA:
I haven't-
---
## DEV:
What about me?
---
## YAEL:
I thought you'd have to work.
---
## DEV:
Um. Ok.
---
## YAEL:
I'm serious. I'm sorry. I would have invited you, Dev, I just thought/
---
## DEV:
You don't need my DNA.
---
## VALERIA:
Hon, that's not/
---
## YAEL:
Right, but that's what I'm saying! Don't you think it would be interesting to see if it's, like, inherited or situational?
---
## DEV:
Um, not really.
---
## YAEL:
Seriously? You don't want to know if your birth / parents, like
---
## VALERIA:
Yael, enough.
---
## PAOLA:
You know, I took one of those DNA tests. That 23me site.
---
## YAEL:
Really?
---
## PAOLA:
It was very interesting. Very, very few Jews are 100% Jewish. Did you know that? I'm not, and I'm from the 'old country' as they say/
---
## VALERIA:
Zagreb isn't the old / country, Ma.
---
## PAOLA:
Did you know I'm 2.3 percent Neanderthal?
---
## VALERIA:
Makes sense.
---
## PAOLA:
Anyway, these days it's hard to tell. It's not just curly hair and big noses. Not that Hitler found us that way / anyway.
---
## VALERIA:
Non fare la noiosa, Ma!
---
## DEV:
Judaism's never been _just_ an ethnicity, though.
---
## YAEL:
Um. Yes it is.
---
I mean, it's a religion too, kind of, but it's also an ethnicity.
---
## DEV:
Judaism's always accepted people in.
---
## YAEL:
If they ask and get turned away three / times first.
---
## VALERIA:
/ Girls!
---
## DEV:
Think about way back in the day, in the desert, like the first Passover, O.G. Passover. Moses married a Midianite, Tzipporah.
---
## YAEL:
So?
---
## DEV:
So his kids were half-Midianite. And do you think they weren't Jews? Because it wasn't their full birthright?
---
## YAEL:
You sound like Dad.
---
## DEV:
What? No I don't.
---
## YAEL:
Yes you do. Like that sermon he wrote that went viral a couple years ago. About Tzipporah and like embracing the stranger.
---
## DEV:
That wasn't his point.
---
## YAEL:
Then what was his point?
---
## DEV:
That Tzipporah's _not_ a stranger.
---
## YAEL:
Ok whatever, I wasn't / saying
---
## VALERIA:
Girls, enough. Honey, hell, you're more Jewish / than any of us.
---
## DEV:
I mean, genetically I'm not. But I was raised with the the language, the holidays, the stories, all the _mishugas_.
---
## PAOLA:
Mishugas is an Ashkenazi word.
---
## YAEL:
The world is so Ashkenormative./
---
## DEV:
Whatever. Even though I don't look like you, I'd be on a list.
---
## VALERIA:
Ma, guarda cosa hai fatto!
---
## PAOLA:
Io? No! Guarda cosa ha fatto Hitler! Ancora, settanta / anni dopo la
---
## DEV:
Speak English! Please!
---
## VALERIA:
Sorry, hon.
---
## PAOLA:
Sorry.
---
## VALERIA:
There's no list.
---
## DEV:
But if there was, I'd be on it. Same as you, Yaya.
---
## YAEL:
That's not / what I
---
## VALERIA:
Who's done with their soup?
---
Everyone hands their plates to Valeria. Dev stands up to help.
---
## PAOLA:
Sit, sit. Watch him.
---
Davide grunts.
---
Valeria and Paola exit to the kitchen with the dishes.
---
A long silence. Too long. At least thirty seconds.
---
## YAEL:
Come ti senti, Nonno?
---
Davide grunts. A beat.
---
## DEV:
Why are you taking Italian?
---
## YAEL:
Language requirement.
---
## DEV:
I took Hebrew.
---
## YAEL:
I already know Hebrew.
---
## DEV:
So did I.
---
## YAEL:
I didn't mean.. I just, I wanted to, I don't know, understand our family better.
---
## DEV:
Like this project?
---
## YAEL:
Dev, I'm sorry. Really. I didn't know it would bring up all this / stuff.
---
## DEV:
It's not.
---
## YAEL:
OK.
---
## DEV:
OK.
---
A beat.
---
## YAEL:
I wish we could have heard more of Nonno's stories, now that he can't...
---
## DEV:
No way he would have let you record him.
---
## YAEL:
How do you know?
---
## DEV:
We talked A LOT this year, Yaya, and I asked him about the war and all that stuff and he knew he was going to lose his speech and he still wouldn't talk.
---
## YAEL:
Oh. I didn't know you/
---
## DEV:
Wanted to know about where I come from? I can't do science or whatever, but...
---
## YAEL:
You should take that test thing Nonna was talking about.
---
## DEV:
23&amp;me?
---
## YAEL:
Yeah.
---
## DEV:
No thanks.
---
## YAEL:
OK. Sorry.
---
A long beat.
---
## DEV:
How's school?
---
## YAEL:
Good.
---
## DEV:
Good.
---
## YAEL:
How's home?
---
## DEV:
Good.
---
## YAEL:
Mom tells me you're kicking ass at the rock gym.
---
## DEV:
I'm only there a couple days a week.
---
## YAEL:
Still.
---
## DEV:
I guess.
---
A beat.
---
## YAEL:
I'm sorry, can we... [start over]?
---
I miss you.
---
## DEV:
You too.
---
## YAEL:
No like really.
---
Whenever I walk by the Women's Fountain, I think of when you visited me at / school and
---
## DEV:
Ohmygoddon't remind me.
---
## YAEL:
I'm like hell yeah that's my sister.
---
## DEV:
A very drunk version of your very square sister.
---
## YAEL:
My square sister danced NAKED / on the Women's
---
## DEV:
Shhhhhhdon't tell Mom.
---
## YAEL:
My lips are sealed
---
my tongue / is tied.
---
## DEV:
Ohmygod!/
---
Dev and ## YAEL:
(with a secret handshake)
---
If secrets are revealed
---
Sisterhood will die!
---
## DEV:
We haven't done that in/
---
## YAEL:
I know.
---
## DEV:
I miss you too.
---
Really.
---
Nonna's been acting (crazy) lately. And Mom's like (barely keeping it together).
---
You know, she has Chinese take-out in the kitchen.
---
## YAEL:
What?
---
## DEV:
Yeah. I found it underneath the sink. She's not even gonna eat all this food she made.
---
## YAEL:
That's crazy.
---
## DEV:
I think she's like purposefully breaking Passover, just to spite Dad.
---
## YAEL:
Well, can you blame her? It's only been like ten months.
---
I thought about staying at school.
---
## DEV:
Yaya/
---
## YAEL:
I didn't obviously. I'm just saying. I don't blame her.
---
## DEV:
When I got home from work the other day, she was giving away the ArtScroll Talmuds. Like what is Goodwill gonna do with 2,000 dollars worth of holy text?
---
## YAEL:
Yikes.
---
A beat.
---
## YAEL:
Are _you_ ok?
---
## DEV:
Yeah, I'm fine.
---
## YAEL:
You're happy here? With work and everything?
---
## DEV:
Living at home and working part-time as a receptionist at a rock gym? Oh yeah, that's the American dream.
---
## YAEL:
I don't know. You get to be outdoorsy and all.
---
## DEV:
It's inside. Air-conditioned.
---
## YAEL:
You know what I mean.
---
## DEV:
...
---
Secret time?
---
## YAEL:
Mylipsaresealedmytongueistied
---
## DEV:
I applied to Rabbinical school.
---
## YAEL:
What?
---
## DEV:
Yeah.
---
## YAEL:
Woah
---
## DEV:
It's not a big / deal
---
## YAEL:
It's a huge deal!
---
## DEV:
Don't say / anything
---
## YAEL:
When do you hear back?
---
## DEV:
A few weeks, probably.
---
## YAEL:
Holy shit.
---
## DEV:
Even if I get in, WHICH I WON'T, I don't know if I'll do it.
---
A tiny beat.
---
## YAEL:
(a dig)
---
I'm sure Dad is excited. Following in his footsteps.
---
## DEV:
I haven't told him yet.
---
I wanted to tell Mom first, see how she...
---
## YAEL:
Yeah.
---
## DEV:
Are you...?
---
## YAEL:
I mean.
---
## DEV:
Please don't be...
---
## YAEL:
What?
---
## DEV:
Mad.
---
## YAEL:
Well what do you want me to say?
---
## DEV:
I don't know.
---
## YAEL:
Just like I can't walk by the Hillel on campus without having a panic attack.
---
Cause like I smell the Manishewitz and remember seeing Margot lying spread eagle on the bimah with Dad and it's like [heavy breathing]
---
## DEV:
That's because he's Dad, not because he's a / Rabbi.
---
## YAEL:
You didn't see it.
---
## DEV:
No, but/
---
## YAEL:
And the way the synagogue just covered it up? So fucking hypocritical.
---
## DEV:
That's not what all synagogues / are like
---
## YAEL:
You weren't there when Mom got the phone call. I had to literally hold her while she/
---
## DEV:
I'm here now. I know what it's been like.
---
## YAEL:
No I know.
---
Mom's gonna be...
---
## DEV:
I know.
---
Anyway it won't even matter. Cause I won't get in.
---
They hear Valeria and Paola entering.
---
Paola (o.s.)
---
Bada a come parli, per favore.
---
## DEV:
Shhhhhhhhh don't tell Mom.
---
If secrets are revealed...
---
Valeria and Paola re-enter with giant plates of traditional Sephardic Passover dishes, and brisket, tofu, and every kind of vegetable.
---
## DEV:
Look at all / this food!
---
## YAEL:
Are you feeding an army in the attic?
---
## VALERIA:
Leftovers!
---
## PAOLA:
She's a Jewish mother. Runs in / the family.
---
## VALERIA:
I made you some tofu. I hope that's ok. I didn't / know what-
---
## YAEL:
Tofu's perfect.
---
## VALERIA:
And there's plenty of vegetables, and lots of desserts.
---
## DEV:
It looks delicious, Ma.
---
## YAEL:
Thank you.
---
All except Valeria start eating their food. Paola takes out her bottom two front teeth. They're attached to wire hooks.
---
## YAEL:
Woah! New teeth, Nonna?
---
Davide attempts a laugh.
---
## VALERIA:
What? Oh my god, Ma!
---
## PAOLA:
I didn't tell you?
---
## VALERIA:
No!
---
## DEV:
She's had them for a couple weeks.
---
## VALERIA:
What happened?
---
## PAOLA:
I'm old, what can I tell you? The dentist tole me I needed new teeth, I got new teeth.
---
## DEV:
And she was too cheap to get the 4000 dollar surgery, / so-
---
## VALERIA:
Ma!
---
## PAOLA:
2000 dollars per tooth? What am I, Rockefeller? No thank you. So I got these dentures. Anyway. One day I woke up - I take them out to go to sleep- and I couldn't find them. I looked everywhere for them. Under the bed, in between the cushions on the couch, everywhere! So then it hit me. The dog must have swallowed them. I was beside myself. So I rushed poor Bacio to the Vet and they gave him this liquid thing-
---
## DEV:
Hydrogen peroxide.
---
## PAOLA:
Right. Hydrogen peroxide. And it made him throw up. But no teeth came up. Meanwhile, this poor dog, he was so scared. Gosh, you should have seen him. Shaking and crying.
---
So I decided to pray for him.
---
You know the last time I prayed? When the Germans were dropping bombs on us. That's when.
---
Anyway, I prayed and prayed. "God, please let Bacio be OK." I told myself if God helped him, I'd promise to be a better Jew. And so the Vet gave him more peroxide, but still, no teeth. But just wait. Devorah searched the house again and what do you know? There it was, under my pillow, can you believe it? Bacio was fine in a few hours.
---
Isn't that a miracle? B'shert, I tell you.
---
## VALERIA:
So how are you being a better Jew now?
---
## PAOLA:
Well I'm here, aren't I?
---
## YAEL:
You're here every year.
---
## PAOLA:
Yes, but with your Nonno this year...
---
But here we are, Baruch Hashem.
---
## DEV:
He looks happier than I've seen him / in a long time.
---
## VALERIA:
They were under your pillow the whole time. That's not a miracle.
---
## PAOLA:
What? You don't believe that things are meant to be?
---
## VALERIA:
Not really.
---
## PAOLA:
Look at your beautiful daughters.
---
Yael and Dev strike silly poses.
---
## PAOLA:
A miracle! What else could it be?
---
Davide starts coughing. He spits up on his bib. Paola and Dev stand to help.
---
## YAEL:
Can I...?
---
## DEV:
Oh. Uh, sure. There's another bib in his bag by the door.
---
Dev sits back down.
---
## PAOLA:
(to Yael, as they exit)
---
You were a miracle.
---
Paola and Yael exit with Davide.
---
## VALERIA:
You were a miracle too, hon.
---
## DEV:
I thought you didn't believe in that.
---
## VALERIA:
I don't. But you were.
---
They continue to eat.
---
## DEV:
It's really good, Ma. You should eat.
---
## VALERIA:
It would be better with bread.
---
## DEV:
You used to love Passover.
---
## VALERIA:
Well.
---
## DEV:
Then why did you do all of this?
---
## VALERIA:
It's your Nonno's favorite holiday, of course I'm doing it.
---
A beat.
---
## VALERIA:
I'm sorry about New Haven.
---
## DEV:
It's fine.
---
## VALERIA:
I'm not even sure if/
---
## DEV:
You should go. Really.
---
## VALERIA:
I don't want to leave my Dad.
---
## DEV:
(gentle)
---
Ma, he probably...
---
## VALERIA:
Won't make it to July. Yeah.
---
At least we're all together now.
---
Dev takes her mother's hand. A beat.
---
## VALERIA:
Well maybe we'll all take a trip this summer. Go to Hawaii, or something. Relax.
---
## DEV:
Nonna's way too stubborn to relax.
---
## VALERIA:
Ha!
---
## DEV:
I was, um. I was thinking about... I mean, obviously I'll wait to see how Nonno...but
---
Uh...
---
I've kind of been saving up to go to China.
---
## VALERIA:
China?
---
## DEV:
Um. Yeah. If that's...
---
## VALERIA:
Of course, hon.
---
I didn't know you were...
---
## DEV:
Not really. I mean...
---
I don't know. But it's Passover. And on Passover we remember what our ancestors did tens of thousands of years ago. Like we can actually remember a past that's tens of thousands of years old.
---
And I don't even know what my people-
---
I mean, you know, my other people, birth people, whatever-
---
what they did, like, ten years ago. Twenty-three years ago.
---
## VALERIA:
I think that's great.
---
## DEV:
Yeah?
---
## VALERIA:
Yeah, I do.
---
A beat.
---
## DEV:
There's this story in the Torah.
---
## VALERIA:
Dev, please.
---
## DEV:
No, just...
---
When the Israelites are in the desert, they complain, saying they're going to die off and stuff.
---
## VALERIA:
What does that have to/
---
## DEV:
Wait. So God made flowers bloom. In the desert. Out of thin air. A miracle. Like as a sign that they would survive. That the Jewish people would bloom. They would never die.
---
## VALERIA:
Ok...
---
## DEV:
I just... it's cool. Whether it was a miracle or not, whatever. It's cool that we're still here. Telling the same story. Surviving. You know, blooming.
---
## VALERIA:
Maybe we should stop telling those stories.
---
## DEV:
Mom.
---
## VALERIA:
Flowers don't bloom in the desert. They can't. The Jews were starving. They were dying off. Why do they tell us these stories and just cover up all the bad stuff / when there's
---
## DEV:
Not everything's about Dad.
---
## VALERIA:
That's not what I said. I just... I don't feel like I'm blooming.
---
## DEV:
Ma.
---
## VALERIA:
Sometimes it's just about making it through the day, getting out of / bed
---
Paola (o.s.)
---
(calling from offstage)
---
Devorah, can you bring the bag by my chair with the extra bib?
---
## DEV:
Sorry. We can/
---
## VALERIA:
No. [Go, go]
---
## DEV:
Coming!
---
Dev grabs the bag and exits.
---
Valeria has a moment to herself. She suppresses her tears until she can't. She lets it all out.
---
When she hears voices, she wipes her face on the tablecloth and shakes it off.
---
Dev (o.s.)
---
You're supposed to wait until the / thing is attached
---
Yael (o.s.)
---
I know you're supposed to wait. I'm not an idiot.
---
Paola, Dev, and Yael re-enter with Davide.
---
## VALERIA:
How is/
---
## YAEL:
Good as new.
---
What are you doing tomorrow night?
---
## PAOLA:
Resting. Nonno can't do two Seders.
---
## YAEL:
Ma?
---
## VALERIA:
Nothing.
---
## YAEL:
Nothing?
---
## PAOLA:
Niente?
---
## DEV:
Really?
---
## VALERIA:
Don't 'really' me.
---
## PAOLA:
È Pasqua, Valeria!
---
## DEV:
Why don't you go to Sharon's?
---
## VALERIA:
I'm an adult. I can make my own decisions.
---
## YAEL:
We'll do another one here. I'll cook. Just the three of us.
---
## VALERIA:
You don't know how / to cook!
---
## DEV:
We have to go to the synagogue with Dad and Margot.
---
## YAEL:
I'm not going.
---
## DEV:
Yael, I promised.
---
## YAEL:
Of course you did.
---
## DEV:
Stop! Don't you want to celebrate, Ma?
---
## VALERIA:
I _want_ to watch "Dancing with the Stars."
---
## PAOLA:
Again with the stars dancing!/
---
## VALERIA:
I teach tomorrow, I don't want to have to set / everything-
---
## PAOLA:
Valeria, è Pasqua!
---
## VALERIA:
UCLA doesn't shut down the whole school, Ma.
---
## DEV:
But you're allowed to take the day off for Jewish holidays, right?
---
## PAOLA:
Certo! / Siamo in America!
---
## VALERIA:
I want to teach, ok? / Drop it.
---
## DEV:
Mom's up for this big award.
---
## YAEL:
Really?
---
## VALERIA:
It's not a big / deal
---
## DEV:
It is a big deal. It's UCLA's Distinguished Teaching Prize.
---
## PAOLA:
Really?
---
## VALERIA:
Yeah.
---
## PAOLA:
Mazel Tov!
---
## YAEL:
Congrats, Ma! So cool!
---
## VALERIA:
Thank you.
---
## YAEL:
What are you teaching now?
---
## VALERIA:
Tomorrow's Fra Fillippo Lippi.
---
## PAOLA:
Ah, the Jesus painter!
---
## YAEL:
Nonna!
---
## PAOLA:
You know, people think we drink Christian blood to make our Matzah for this holiday.
---
## VALERIA:
/ Ma, come on!
---
## PAOLA:
So vai, vai. Teach Jesus on Passover!
---
In Zagreb, you know, we didn't even use red wine on Passover. In case the neighbors mistook it for blood.
---
## YAEL:
We know.
---
## DEV:
We know.
---
## PAOLA:
Girls, it's your turn. I've tried. You have to remind your mother that she's Jewish.
---
## DEV:
/ Nonna!
---
## VALERIA:
What did I cook this whole meal for?
---
## PAOLA:
Ever since your / father
---
## VALERIA:
Basta!
---
## PAOLA:
You get to a certain age, girls, no one listens to you anymore. Look at your Nonno.
---
Davide grunts. It's clear he's in pain. They look at him. A beat.
---
## VALERIA:
Have you changed your mind about...
---
## PAOLA:
No.
---
## VALERIA:
But if he's in pain/
---
## YAEL:
What are you talking about?
---
## DEV:
DNR.
---
## YAEL:
He wants to be resuscitated??
---
## PAOLA:
Sì, certo. He wrote it down five years ago.
---
## VALERIA:
_Before_ he was diagnosed with ALS.
---
## PAOLA:
He didn't survive Auschwitz just to give up.
---
## VALERIA:
But Ma, he's 87 years old.
---
## PAOLA:
He's a fighter. Trust me.
---
Just look at him.
---
They all look at Davide. Davide grunts.
---
## YAEL:
Do you have power of attorney?
---
## PAOLA:
Sei troppo giovane per sapere di / queste cose.
---
## YAEL:
Ho diciannove / anni!
---
## VALERIA:
English, Ma.
---
## PAOLA:
How do you know about these things?
---
## YAEL:
I'm pre-med, Nonna.
---
## PAOLA:
So what do your medical studies tell you?
---
## YAEL:
Well, uh, in cases where death is [inevitable], you know, with or without medical / intervention
---
## VALERIA:
Which it / is.
---
## YAEL:
There's no benefit, just additional pain.
---
## VALERIA:
See?
---
## DEV:
Yael! That's not... It's really more of an ethical issue.
---
## PAOLA:
Esattamente!
---
## VALERIA:
I don't want him to pass away either, Ma, but/
---
## YAEL:
What does the Torah say, Dev?
---
## DEV:
What?
---
## VALERIA:
How would Dev / know?
---
## DEV:
Oh right I don't know anything because I don't go to Yale?/
---
## VALERIA:
No of course not, / hon, that's
---
## YAEL:
Well you've been studying this stuff, right?
---
## DEV:
Yael!
---
## VALERIA:
What?
---
## YAEL:
Just tell her!
---
## DEV:
(Shut up)
---
## VALERIA:
Tell me what?
---
## DEV:
(Seriously? You can't keep a secret / for like five minutes?)
---
## PAOLA:
What secret?
---
## DEV:
Nothing.
---
## YAEL:
Dev, come / on
---
## DEV:
If secrets are revealed,
---
Sisterhood will die.
---
## VALERIA:
Enough. Just tell me.
---
A beat. Yael looks at Dev.
---
## YAEL:
Dev applied to Rabbinical school.
---
## DEV:
Yael!
---
## PAOLA:
What?
---
## DEV:
Um, yeah. Nonno helped me with the application before...
---
They all look at Davide. He gives a thumbs up.
---
## VALERIA:
Why didn't you tell me?
---
## YAEL:
It's pretty obvious how you feel about Rabbis, / Ma.
---
## DEV:
Seriously stop talking!/
---
## PAOLA:
They have women Rabbis now?
---
## YAEL:
Nonna, of course they do!
---
## PAOLA:
(taking Davide's hand)
---
Le mie nipotine! Una dottoressa ed una / Rabbina!
---
## VALERIA:
When did you apply?
---
## DEV:
A few months ago
---
## VALERIA:
Did your father encourage / you to
---
## DEV:
No!
---
## VALERIA:
I'm just asking!
---
## DEV:
Ohmygod I knew you were gonna react / this way
---
## VALERIA:
Well how should I react?
---
## DEV:
Like a Mom! I don't know! Like you haven't been dreading what I want to do / with my life
---
## VALERIA:
So I should just not say anything?
---
## DEV:
You know that's / not what I
---
## VALERIA:
So your plan is what? To leave for China and then go right to Rabbinical school?
---
## YAEL:
China?
---
## PAOLA:
What's in China?
---
## DEV:
No, it's not a... I'm not even going to get in / so this is
---
## VALERIA:
Dev's going to China this summer.
---
## YAEL:
Ooh can I come?
---
## DEV:
I thought you were working in that lab
---
## YAEL:
Not the whole summer
---
## VALERIA:
And I'll be here. By myself.
---
## DEV:
The school is in LA, Ma. So I wouldn't even be leaving.
---
## VALERIA:
You'd have to be in Israel for your third year. Your father/
---
## DEV:
This isn't about him! / It's about me! I'm trying to figure out who I am and where
---
## VALERIA:
Of course it's about him. / How can it not be
---
## PAOLA:
Basta! Forse sarebbe l'ultimo Seder di tuo padre.
---
## VALERIA:
Lo so! Why do you think I did all of this?
---
A beat.
---
## PAOLA:
So _Rabbi_. What does the Torah say about DNR?
---
## DEV:
Well now I don't want / to
---
## YAEL:
Oh come on.
---
## DEV:
Not if you're all gonna look at me like I'm the demon / child
---
## PAOLA:
Please, gioia. For Nonno.
---
Davide gives a thumbs up. Dev looks at her grandfather.
---
## DEV:
Well, um, Pirkei Avot tells us that "we are not to judge another person until we have been in their place."
---
## VALERIA:
Fluffy bullshit, / as usual.
---
## PAOLA:
Parla per bene, / Valeria. Sheesh!
---
## DEV:
But there are kind of two opposing camps. On the one hand, uh...
---
Jewish philosophy is based on the idea that life is sacred. The Talmud tells us that one who closes the eyes of a dying person, bringing about death by mere moments, is a full-fledged murderer.
---
## PAOLA:
Aha!
---
## VALERIA:
Oh come on!
---
## DEV:
But... Halakha also recognizes that life is finite. If there's no... cure, uh, medication may be withdrawn. If a patient wishes.
---
## PAOLA:
Which he / doesn't.
---
## YAEL:
So. Just. Make up your own rules?
---
## VALERIA:
Testa dura! When I'm that age, girls, just pull the plug.
---
## DEV:
Ma!
---
## YAEL:
Mom!
---
## VALERIA:
Not if I have a cold! But anything worse, hasta la vista.
---
## PAOLA:
Basta, Valeria.
---
A long, awkward beat.
---
## PAOLA:
Yaya, tell us about the young man you're seeing.
---
## VALERIA:
What?
---
## YAEL:
Nonna!
---
## PAOLA:
I didn't know it was a secret.
---
## VALERIA:
Everything's a secret / tonight.
---
## YAEL:
It's not. I mean...
---
## DEV:
You're seeing someone?
---
## YAEL:
Kind of, / yeah.
---
## VALERIA:
Who?
---
## YAEL:
His name is Nate. Nate Moore. He's in Branford with me.
---
## PAOLA:
Moore. That's an awfully goyischa / name
---
## VALERIA:
Ma.
---
## PAOLA:
What? Is he Jewish?
---
...
---
He's not Jewish?
---
## YAEL:
No.
---
## PAOLA:
Ay. Capisci, Davide?
---
Davide grunts.
---
## VALERIA:
Ma, stop.
---
## PAOLA:
What? You approve?
---
## VALERIA:
Is he a nice guy?
---
## YAEL:
The nicest.
---
## PAOLA:
You couldn't find the nicest Jewish guy?
---
## YAEL:
Isn't that discrimination?
---
## PAOLA:
Valeria, devi parlare / con lei!
---
## VALERIA:
Ma, what? If he's a good guy/
---
## YAEL:
He is.
---
## VALERIA:
So I'm just saying that it's more important to find someone who respects you, who loves you, who will be loyal to you, than what holidays he celebrates.
---
## DEV:
Seriously?
---
## YAEL:
Thank you.
---
## PAOLA:
You know how many Jews we lost? Your grandparents? Your aunts and uncles? Cousins?
---
## VALERIA:
Non / di nuovo!
---
## PAOLA:
Because we were Jewish. Because we wanted to raise our children Jewish. Not to have goyischa great-grandchildren asking us what we got them for Christmas.
---
## VALERIA:
Ma, basta!
---
## YAEL:
You never harass Dev about who's she dating!
---
## DEV:
Yael!
---
## PAOLA:
She doesn't date! If she did, you bet your tuches I would harass her.
---
## DEV:
It's not that I don't date.
---
## PAOLA:
Oh?
---
## DEV:
I just don't tell you about my dates.
---
## VALERIA:
Who are you / dating?
---
## YAEL:
You're dating / someone?
---
## PAOLA:
Is he Jewish?
---
## DEV:
I'm just saying.
---
## VALERIA:
Well, good luck dating when you're a Rabbi.
---
Valeria storms off into the kitchen to get dessert.
---
## DEV:
Ohmygod
---
## YAEL:
She's right. How many birthdays did Dad miss?
---
## PAOLA:
Yaya, per favore.
---
Is Nate at least a convert-able?
---
## YAEL:
Convertible?
---
## PAOLA:
Will he convert?
---
## YAEL:
We've only been dating for a few months.
---
## PAOLA:
Ah, well, sei giovane. Avrai molti fidanzati.
---
## YAEL:
I really like him, Nonna.
---
## PAOLA:
I dated a goy guy once, you know.
---
## DEV:
Really?
---
## PAOLA:
Back in Italy, during the war. At the convent.
---
## YAEL:
I haven't heard this story.
---
## PAOLA:
Your Nonno doesn't like me to talk about other men. Right, gioia?
---
Davide grunts.
---
## PAOLA:
Anyway. There was this handsome young blonde man who fixed things around the convent. He was kind. Never said a word to anyone about who I was. I think his name was Giorgio, or Rolfe, or Federico or something. He was always looking at me. Especially when I sang.
---
## YAEL:
You sang?
---
## PAOLA:
Of course! The nuns taught me all sorts of songs.
---
## DEV:
Nonna, I think you're getting confused with The Sound of Music.
---
## PAOLA:
No, they taught me all sorts of Christian songs.
---
And By the way, the movie was garbage, total nonsense.
---
## YAEL:
We know!
---
## DEV:
We know!
---
Yael tries to connect with Dev. Dev doesn't meet her gaze.
---
## PAOLA:
When we were running for our lives through the hills to Italy, you think we could sing and dance? "The hills are alive!" Nonsense.
---
I love the music, though. Beautiful.
---
(singing)
---
"Edelweiss, edelweiss..."
---
## YAEL:
So what happened to _Rolfe_?
---
## PAOLA:
Oh. Well, when the War was over, I wanted to find my family. The nuns wanted to keep me of course. They were very kind, but I wanted my Mama. (I didn't know she was dead.) So I left. Ciao. Goodbye. I went to the DP camp, and I met your Nonno. Much more handsome. And _Jewish_.
---
Davide spits up.
---
## PAOLA:
Oy, not again.
---
Paola attends to Davide. While she's distracted, Yael and Dev whisper to each other.
---
## YAEL:
I'm sorry, Dev. / Really.
---
## DEV:
No you're not. This is fun for you.
---
## YAEL:
She was going to find out eventually.
---
## DEV:
Yeah, whenI decided to tell her.
---
## YAEL:
And when were you going / to decide
---
## DEV:
Literally any day but today.
---
## YAEL:
Well I'm sorry, ok?
---
A long beat.
---
Valeria enters with all kinds of Kosher for Passover desserts.
---
## YAEL:
Oy, Ma, you're killing my diet.
---
Paola sits back down.
---
## PAOLA:
You and me both.
---
## YAEL:
You're timeless, Nonna.
---
## PAOLA:
And you're a liar, carina.
---
A knock on the door.
---
## PAOLA:
Who's knocking at this time of night?
---
## DEV:
Maybe it's Elijah?
---
Only Davide laughs/grunts.
---
## YAEL:
I'll go get it.
---
Yael exits to answer the door.
---
## DEV:
Did you know Nonna dated a goy / during the War?
---
## PAOLA:
Carina!
---
## VALERIA:
That's not true.
---
## PAOLA:
How would you know?
---
## VALERIA:
Ha!
---
## PAOLA:
What? I don't tell you everything.
---
## VALERIA:
You can't just make up stories, Ma.
---
## DEV:
Mom!
---
## PAOLA:
I'm not!
---
Yael returns.
---
## YAEL:
Girl scouts. I said no.
---
## VALERIA:
Damn, I'm out of Samoas.
---
## PAOLA:
È Pasqua, / Valeria!
---
## YAEL:
They'll be more than enough leftover dessert anyway, Ma.
---
## DEV:
Mmm it's so good. I can't believe it doesn't have flour.
---
## PAOLA:
Proprio come la torta di Pasqua di mia madre.
---
## VALERIA:
It's her recipe.
---
## PAOLA:
Brava!
---
## YAEL:
You still have Nonna Valeria's recipes?
---
## PAOLA:
Do you just turn off your ears when I talk?
---
## VALERIA:
There _are_ a lot of stories, Ma.
---
## YAEL:
That's why I want to record them!
---
## PAOLA:
Well, here's one. I kept the recipes in my brassiere all throughout the war.
---
## YAEL:
You were five when you left Zagreb. Were you really wearing a bra?
---
## PAOLA:
I was quite developed at a young age. Like you.
---
## YAEL:
I'm nineteen!
---
## PAOLA:
OK, maybe in my socks. I don't know.
---
I'm 85 years old, what do you want?
---
## DEV:
Well, I can't hide anything in my bra. Tiny boobies.
---
## YAEL:
I wish I had your tette! You can wear anything you want and run and climb and stuff without them jiggling / everywhere.
---
## VALERIA:
Girls, your Nonno's sitting right / there.
---
## PAOLA:
Oh he doesn't mind.
---
When we first moved here, your Nonno made us speak English all the time. Right, gioia? To assimilate, you know, learn the language. Except when we would talk about three things:
---
All
---
Judaism, money, and the bathroom.
---
## PAOLA:
Ok, so you listen to some of my stories.
---
## DEV:
Even I know what "quel posto" means.
---
## YAEL:
The bathroom, really?
---
## PAOLA:
È volgare!
---
## YAEL:
How is it / vulgar?
---
## PAOLA:
Do you really want me to talk about making pishy and poopy?
---
Davide makes a thumbs down.
---
## PAOLA:
See?
---
## YAEL:
OK, but Judaism? Why couldn't you talk about/
---
## PAOLA:
Ah, essere giovane e spensierata.
---
## VALERIA:
/ Aaand we're back again.
---
## PAOLA:
It was bad enough with our accents. You think we wanted to broadcast who we were?
---
## YAEL:
But you're white. And in America. That's like having literally the most privilege in the / world.
---
## VALERIA:
Yael/
---
## YAEL:
And isn't that what this holiday is supposed to be about? We remind ourselves every year that we suffered. That we were slaves. That we were oppressed. This same old story over and over again. But we're not the victims anymore.
---
## DEV:
So what? We shouldn't celebrate Passover, the most / important
---
## YAEL:
Well we're free now, / so
---
## PAOLA:
Free for now.
---
## VALERIA:
Non di nuovo/
---
## PAOLA:
In Zagreb, when I was a little girl, we thought we were free. We were, what did you say, "privileged," right? My father was a dentist, you know?
---
## YAEL:
We know.
---
## DEV:
We know.
---
## PAOLA:
But it's a cycle.
---
When something goes wrong- the economy crashes, there's a war, whatever - we're to blame for everything. The Jews.
---
Then my father loses his job. The Germans start knocking on doors, dropping bombs. We're not Yugoslavs anymore. We're Jews. Everyone hates us.
---
## YAEL:
OK.
---
I'm sorry, Nonna.
---
Dev grabs more dessert.
---
## PAOLA:
No. Don't you be sorry. Arguing is good. Arguing is Jewish. Tip-toeing around other peoples' feelings all the time, that's what Wasps are for.
---
## VALERIA:
Ma!
---
## PAOLA:
What? È / vero.
---
## YAEL:
OK. So then / it was
---
## VALERIA:
Yael, let's just finish / the meal.
---
## YAEL:
See? That's the problem! We're all too uncomfortable to talk about our privilege. People say, "The Jews control the banks. The Jews control Hollywood. The Jews control the White House." And then we throw a fit and say "oh, that's antisemitism."
---
## DEV:
It is.
---
## YAEL:
I know. Obviously. But isn't it also kind of true?
---
## PAOLA:
You should be proud. We are in those positions because we're a people of the book. We value knowledge. We value education.
---
## DEV:
All people value knowledge and education.
---
## VALERIA:
That's true.
---
## YAEL:
So you agree when Dev / says it.
---
## VALERIA:
That's not / true.
---
## YAEL:
Whatever. All people value knowledge and education, right. But because we're white, and we're in America, and we have money, we have the _privilege_ to be / in those positions
---
## PAOLA:
Yale is filling your head with all sorts of garbage. The school had a Jewish quota until the 1960's, / you know.
---
## VALERIA:
That was over 50 years ago, Ma.
---
## PAOLA:
That may feel like a long time to you, / but to me
---
## VALERIA:
Today, there are more than 30 different Jewish clubs at UCLA. And those students, they're marching for Black Lives Matter, for metoo. A group from Hillel went to the border last week to protest family separation. I think being Jewish means standing up for those who are being oppressed now.
---
## YAEL:
Exactly! We say "Never Again." Never Again can't be this like catchphrase to dismiss our own privilege and the harm that we do as white people.
---
## PAOLA:
But who will march for us when the time comes? / Huh?
---
## YAEL:
Nonna, I just think it's time we realize that it was horrible back then. It was. But it's very different here, now.
---
## PAOLA:
Like I said. For now. Wait till something goes wrong.
---
## DEV:
Something _is_ wrong.
---
## PAOLA:
And what do you know? Swatstikas and guns wow wow wow. They're back in fashion.
---
## YAEL:
Dev, you of all people should know what I'm / talking about
---
## DEV:
Me of all people? / Seriously?
---
## VALERIA:
/ Yael!
---
## DEV:
One minute you act like I'm not here and then all of a sudden when I don't take your side / you
---
## YAEL:
No, I just mean that... you know what / I
---
## DEV:
(hard)
---
Yes. I know what you mean.
---
## VALERIA:
Can't it be both? I mean, can't we be multiple things at once?
---
## YAEL:
Sure, but there are people that are in actual danger. There's real violence, real hatred, for people who were not born here, or who aren't white. And we're responsible for that!
---
## PAOLA:
How am I responsible?
---
## YAEL:
We're like perpetuating the system. We came here with a 200 year head / start.
---
## PAOLA:
Your Nonno and I came here with nothing.
---
## YAEL:
Exactly! And look at us now.
---
## PAOLA:
È vero, carina.
---
But first it was the Egyptians, then the Babylonians, then the Greeks, the Romans, the Christians, the Crusades, the Ghettos, the Pogroms, then the Germans.
---
Who's next?
---
Five hundred or even fifty years is a long time for the young. But for the old, it's not long enough to forget. Or to rest.
---
A long beat. Yael reaches for another piece of cake.
---
## VALERIA:
You're still hungry?
---
## YAEL:
It's Passover.
---
...
---
You didn't say anything when Dev took more food.
---
## PAOLA:
Well Dev is...
---
## YAEL:
Skinnier?
---
## VALERIA:
Yaya.
---
## DEV:
Oh come on.
---
## YAEL:
What? It's true.
---
## PAOLA:
I should watch my weight too. / Not just you.
---
## VALERIA:
You each have your own beautiful and different / strengths.
---
## YAEL:
Yeah well I want one that doesn't make you cringe every time I want to eat.
---
## PAOLA:
Carina
---
## VALERIA:
We weren't / cringing.
---
## YAEL:
Yes you / were!
---
## DEV:
Ohmygod stop!/
---
## YAEL:
What?
---
## DEV:
You're Yael and you go to Yale and you're smart and perfect because you don't give a shit about being Jewish / so just
---
## YAEL:
Yes / I do! Why would
---
## DEV:
So just stop complaining for like / one second.
---
## YAEL:
You realize that, like, this is a problem for me, right? That I have body issues and you're / like triggering them right now?
---
## VALERIA:
You should have another / piece of cake, Yaya. I'm sorry.
---
## DEV:
Ohmygod how am I "triggering" them?
---
## YAEL:
Do you even weigh 100 pounds?
---
## DEV:
Yael/
---
## YAEL:
So you don't know.
---
## DEV:
Oh of course I don't.
---
## YAEL:
What?
---
## DEV:
How could I possibly know what it's like to look different from you?
---
## YAEL:
That's not what I / was saying!
---
## DEV:
Then what were you / saying?
---
## VALERIA:
Girls! Stop!
---
## YAEL:
This was my...
---
The one thing that I...
---
## DEV:
Really?
---
## YAEL:
What?/
---
## DEV:
Seriously? You're like "oh I'm _special_ because I have 'disordered eating'?" Like as if that's your special little trauma narrative, that you can't control what you eat?
---
## PAOLA:
Devorah!
---
## DEV:
Is that Nonno's fault too? He starved in Auschwitz, and so you like inherited an eating disorder? Is that why / you're doing this
---
## VALERIA:
That's enough, Dev.
---
## YAEL:
How did this turn into a fight?
---
## DEV:
You're a trauma junkie, everything with you turns into a fight. I'm a cannibal, I hate the / environment
---
## YAEL:
When did I ever say that to you?
---
## DEV:
It's not what you say, it's how / you say it
---
## YAEL:
(getting revenge)
---
That's bullshit, we all bend over backwards/
---
## DEV:
/ Well I'm sorry I'm such a-
---
## YAEL:
all the time to make you feel like a part of this family and you still complain that we/
---
Davide bangs his hands on the table in anger. Everyone shuts up.
---
## VALERIA:
Yael, apologize to your sister.
---
## YAEL:
What? She's the one that... what did I/ ???
---
## VALERIA:
Now!
---
## DEV:
Do you feel that way?
---
That I'm not a part / of this family?
---
## YAEL:
No, no, that's not what I/
---
## VALERIA:
Of course not, hon. How could you/
---
## DEV:
I'm going to my room.
---
Dev stands up.
---
## PAOLA:
Devorah, sit down.
---
## DEV:
You know, I did one of those 23&amp;me things too. I'm 83 percent Chinese, 7 percent Southeast Asian. Woo!
---
## YAEL:
You said you / didn't want
---
## DEV:
I'm zero percent Ashkenazi and zero percent Sephardic. Surprise surprise.
---
My birth parents I guess didn't take it, but I found some second cousins with names I don't even know how to pronounce.
---
And I don't... I mean. I didn't need a piece of paper to tell me where I come from, or who I belong to.
---
Dev starts to walk away.
---
## VALERIA:
Dev!
---
## DEV:
I'm not hungry anymore.
---
## VALERIA:
Why do we always have to fight every time there's a stupid Jewish holiday?
---
## DEV:
You're Jews. Apparently that's what you do.
---
## PAOLA:
You are too. Don't you take after / your mother
---
## VALERIA:
How is this my fault?
---
## YAEL:
Don't you want to be like a freaking leader of the Jews?
---
## DEV:
I'm not even going to get in, so this is just stupid and pointless and Yael should just leave and go back to Yale.
---
## YAEL:
How is this / my fault?
---
## DEV:
I'm done!
---
## PAOLA:
Ma è Pasqua, Devorah! Non essere/
---
## DEV:
SPEAK ENGLISH! WE'RE IN AMERICA, WE SPEAK ENGLISH HERE! I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING!
---
## VALERIA:
Devorah Levi Katz, don't you yell at your / Nonna!
---
## YAEL:
Let's just finish the Seder and then / you can go be a crazy person.
---
As Dev exits:
---
## DEV:
Blah blah blah next year in freaking Jerusalem!
---
END OF PART ONE.
---
part 2: Chag ha-cheirut (the festival of freedom)
---
The past. 65 years before Part One. A warm evening in April. A small apartment in Los Angeles, California. A Passover Table.
---
Projection: April 1954, 15th of Nissan 5719. Los Angeles, California.
---
Davide (22) and Paola (20) sit around the table. When they speak in English, they both speak with heavy accents.
---
## DAVIDE:
(reading from the Haggadah, struggling)
---
Hineni. Here I am, ready to perform de mitzvah of retelling de story of de Exodus from Egypt.
---
## PAOLA:
Brava. Possiamo mangiare adesso?
---
(_Good. Can we eat now?_)
---
## DAVIDE:
Ah ah, in inglese, tesoro mio.
---
(_Ah, ah, in English, my treasure_.)
---
## PAOLA:
(mocking the English)
---
I'm hungry. Is time to eat?
---
## DAVIDE:
It de Ma Nishtanah. And you have twenty years old. Dat's more more young dan me.
---
## PAOLA:
I don't remember de words.
---
## DAVIDE:
That is what de book / is for.
---
## PAOLA:
Non riesco a leggere l'Inglese o l'ebraico, Davide. Lo sai che non riesco. Perché tu /
---
(_I can't read English or Hebrew, Davide. You know I can't. Why are you / trying_)
---
## DAVIDE:
OK. I'm sorry, gioia.
---
Davide pours himself another glass of wine.
---
## DAVIDE:
Tu vuoi?
---
(_Do you want?_)
---
## PAOLA:
Just a little.
---
Davide pours Paola a full glass.
---
## PAOLA:
Davide!
---
## DAVIDE:
Four cups of wine, yes?
---
## PAOLA:
Over de whole Seder, not all four before food.
---
## DAVIDE:
Is holiday!
---
## PAOLA:
Is Tuesday! You have work / tomorrow.
---
## DAVIDE:
Every day is holiday in America!
---
## PAOLA:
I go early to factory tomorrow.
---
## DAVIDE:
So you need good sleep.
---
Paola reluctantly raises her glass. Davide too.
---
## DAVIDE:
Barukh atah adonai eloheinu melekh ha'olam, borei pri hagafen.
---
## PAOLA:
Amen.
---
They cheers and drink.
---
## DAVIDE:
Is good wine.
---
## PAOLA:
Rosa gave to me.
---
## DAVIDE:
Who is Rosa?
---
## PAOLA:
Other seamstress at factory.
---
## DAVIDE:
See? Friends already!
---
## PAOLA:
No friend. Other seamstress.
---
She is from Mexico. She speak Spanish, io parlo l'italiano (_I speak Italian)_, we quasi (_kind of_) understand each other.
---
## DAVIDE:
Good!
---
## PAOLA:

## DAVIDE:
You find her husband.
---
## PAOLA:
Who? Who I know?
---
## DAVIDE:
We meet people soon.
---
## PAOLA:
Where?
---
## DAVIDE:
We go to sinagoga, Rabbi find us people.
---
## PAOLA:
Non di nuovo.
---
(_Not again_)
---
## DAVIDE:
What?
---
## PAOLA:
We no go to sinagoga.
---
## DAVIDE:
Gioia/
---
## PAOLA:
No. End of conversation.
---
## DAVIDE:
Fine. I go to sinagoga. I meet Rabbi. He find us husband for Rosa.
---
Husband for bottle of wine? Is good deal.
---
## PAOLA:
Rosa no is Jewish.
---
## DAVIDE:
Oh.
---
## PAOLA:
No one here is Jewish.
---
## DAVIDE:
If we go to / sinagoga
---
## PAOLA:
Rosa is Catholic. I tell her I know all de prayers. She no believe me. So I start saying dem. She believe me den.
---
## DAVIDE:
Yes.
---
## PAOLA:
She ask me if I meet Pope in Roma.
---
## DAVIDE:
Ha!
---
## PAOLA:
Papa Pio XII. Il bastardo!
---
## DAVIDE:
Sì.
---
## PAOLA:
She say he best Pope ever. I tell her he murder your family.
---
## DAVIDE:
You said dat?
---
## PAOLA:
Yes I said dat, of course I said dat!
---
## DAVIDE:
Paola.
---
## PAOLA:
What? He no lift finger to save Jews. He sit there twirling thumbs on 'quel posto' when Nazis come in and put all of us on trains.
---
Rosa said he save Rabbi. She heard on radio he save Zolli.
---
## DAVIDE:
Zolli è un traditore.
---
(_Zolli is a traitor_)
---
## PAOLA:
Dis what I say!
---
He become Catholic to save il suo culo
---
(_his ass_)
---
## DAVIDE:
Esattamente!
---
(_Exactly!_)
---
## PAOLA:
See? We no be friends.
---
## DAVIDE:
She still give wine.
---
## PAOLA:
She is good woman.
---
She sends i soldi to her family back in Mexico.
---
(_money_)
---
Paola is sweating profusely. She starts fanning herself to no avail.
---
## PAOLA:
Fa troppo caldo.
---
## DAVIDE:
Inglese, gioia.
---
(_English, my joy_)
---
## PAOLA:
Is too hot.

## DAVIDE:

## PAOLA:

---
## DAVIDE:
A fan.
---
## PAOLA:
We need a fan.

## DAVIDE:
We get fan soon.
---
## PAOLA:
Soon, soon, everything soon.
---
## DAVIDE:

## PAOLA:
Why we no get one from John?
---
## DAVIDE:

---
## PAOLA:
Yes. He say he has extra fan.

## DAVIDE:
You talk to him?
---
## PAOLA:
Oh finiscila.
---
(_Oh stop it_)
---
## DAVIDE:
He like you.

## PAOLA:

## DAVIDE:

---
## PAOLA:

---
## DAVIDE:

---
So. We can say Mah Nishtana?
---
## PAOLA:
Can we just pass it?
---
## DAVIDE:
Paola.
---
## PAOLA:
No 'Paola' me.
---
## DAVIDE:
Is Pasqua.
---
## PAOLA:
So?
---
## DAVIDE:
Is what we do.
---
## PAOLA:
In old country, maybe.
---
## DAVIDE:
Paola. Our brothers and sisters/
---
## PAOLA:
No! You no / tell me about
---
## DAVIDE:
They would want us to / make Seder.
---
## PAOLA:
Non ero a Auschwitz, ma ho perso anche io la mia famiglia
---
(_I wasn't in Auschwitz, but I lost my family too.)_
---
## DAVIDE:
Lo so. Perdonami.
---
(_I know. Forgive me._)
---
A beat. The sound of a knock on the door. Paola instinctively starts hiding the Jewish Seder items.
---
## DAVIDE:
Paola, it no is our door. Knock from upstairs.
---
## PAOLA:
Oh, I thought...
---
## DAVIDE:
I know. But is ok. Is America.
---
A beat.
---
## DAVIDE:
We do one part den food, ok?
---
## PAOLA:
Davide.
---
## DAVIDE:
What?
---
## PAOLA:
I no know parts.
---
## DAVIDE:
Yes you do.
---
## PAOLA:
No.
---
## DAVIDE:
You know Mah Nishtana. You know ten piaghe.
---
(_ten plagues_)
---
## PAOLA:
No.
---
## DAVIDE:
Fine, den song. Just one song. Mi Chamocha? You know-
---
(half-singing)
---
Mi Chamocha Ba...
---
Gioia?
---
A beat.
---
## PAOLA:
In convent I try to make Seder. I take... come si dice... vino di comunione/
---
## DAVIDE:
Communion wine.
---
## PAOLA:
I take communion wine and uh wafer. For Matzah. But I no remember prayers. I try and try but...
---
Den de nun, Suora Maria, she come in and she tell me to say prayer before bed. And I remember all of "Pater noster qui es in caelis" (_Our father, who art in heaven_) - I still remember- but I no remember de Jewish prayers.
---
I cry and cry because I thought my parents be mad at me. How I remember "Pater noster" and no de words of _my_ people?
---
## DAVIDE:
You had eight years old, gioia.
---
## PAOLA:
Lo so, ma ancora... is hard for me when you try make us be Jewish.
---
(_I know, but still...)_
---
## DAVIDE:
We are Jewish.
---
## PAOLA:
Yes.
---
## DAVIDE:

---
Is not same though.
---
## PAOLA:
Is not same, no.
---
A beat.
---
## PAOLA:

---
A beat. Davide tops off his glass of wine, then Paola's.
---
## PAOLA:
Parla con me, tesoro mio.
---
(_Talk to me, my treasure._)
---
## DAVIDE:
What you want me to say?
---
## PAOLA:
Something.
---
Anything.
---
## DAVIDE:
I no have something to say.
---
## PAOLA:
You have to start to talk about it.
---
## DAVIDE:
I no "have to."
---
## PAOLA:
Davide.
---
## DAVIDE:
No. No one at work ask me. When I clean 'quel posto' no one ask me 'oh where you from?'
---
They no look in eyes, just walk by.
---
And is good.
---
Is how / I want.
---
## PAOLA:
I am no someone at work.
---
## DAVIDE:
I know.
---
## PAOLA:
I am me.
---
## PAOLA:

---
## DAVIDE:
We in America so we no _need_ to talk about it.
---
Is too soon.
---
## PAOLA:
Is ten years.
---
## DAVIDE:
Pasqua mi fa triste, OK?
---
(_Passover makes me sad, ok?)_
---
Mama make il petto di manzo (_brisket_), Nonna make la minestra (_soup_). Piccolo (_little_) Alberto say Mah Nishtana. Mi fa triste, Paola. (_It makes me sad, Paola_)
---
## PAOLA:
Ok.
---
## DAVIDE:
I do one in Auschwitz. Guard bang on door. We no need Maror to show us
---
(he looks in the Haggadah)
---
"bitterness of slavery."
---
Davide drinks from his wine. A beat.
---
## PAOLA:
Next year be more easy.
---
And more easy year after year after.
---
## DAVIDE:
Maybe.
---
## PAOLA:
Yes. I will make more easy. I make petto di manzo (_brisket_) like your Mama. You make la minestra (_soup_) like my Nonna.
---
## DAVIDE:
And piccola Valeria say Mah Nishtana.
---
(_And little Valeria say the Four Questions._)
---
## PAOLA:
Piccola Valeria?
---
## DAVIDE:
I thought we could name her after your Mama.
---
## PAOLA:
Valeria, mmmm.
---
Forse piccolo Yosef. Come tuo padre.
---
(_Maybe little Yosef. Like your father._)
---
## DAVIDE:
We make hundred babies who all fight to say Mah Nishtana.
---
## PAOLA:
Hundred?
---
## DAVIDE:
Twenty boys, eighty girls.
---
## PAOLA:
E li spingerai tutti fuori dalla tua vagina?
---
(_And you will push them all out of your vagina?_)
---
## DAVIDE:

---
## PAOLA:

## DAVIDE:

---
## DAVIDE:

(_Cherry blossoms._)
---
## PAOLA:

---
Ma non abbiamo soldi to make hundred babies.
---
(_But we don't have money to..._)
---
## DAVIDE:
So start with one, yes?
---
## PAOLA:
Maybe. Soon.
---
## DAVIDE:
"Soon, soon, everything soon."
---
Paola drinks from her cup.
---
## PAOLA:
You make me drink four cups of vino, maybe we start tonight.
---
## DAVIDE:
No make joke.
---
## PAOLA:
Is no joke.
---
## DAVIDE:
Is no joke?
---
Paola shakes her head. Davide kisses her.
---
Davide raises his glass of wine.
---
## DAVIDE:
New favorite holiday! Sexy holiday!
---
They clink glasses.
---
## PAOLA:
Pasqua no is sexy.
---
## DAVIDE:

## PAOLA:

## DAVIDE:

---
## PAOLA:
You think they be smart?
---
## DAVIDE:
So smart. Doctors and Rabbis!
---
## PAOLA:
Doctors and Rabbis, ha!
---
## DAVIDE:

## PAOLA:

---
(_dentist)_

## DAVIDE:

---
## PAOLA:

## DAVIDE:

---
## DAVIDE:

## PAOLA:

---
## DAVIDE:

---
(_It's important that everyone I love died? No, it's not important! It's the past!)_
---
## PAOLA:
Anche tutti quelli che _io_ amavo sono morti, / Davide.
---
(_Everyone I love died too, Davide_)
---
## DAVIDE:
Hai scavato le tombe dei tuoi genitori? Hai sentito puzza di capelli bruciati quando ti sei svegliata?
---
(_Did you dig your parents' graves? Did you smell burnt hair when you woke up?_)
---
A beat.
---
## PAOLA:
L'hai fatto?
---
(_You did that_?)
---
Davide nods. He composes himself.
---
## DAVIDE:
See? You no like me still.
---
## PAOLA:

---
Husband and wife need to tell each other everything. Good and bad. Is only way to be free.

## DAVIDE:

---
## PAOLA:

---
## DAVIDE:

A long silence.

Tesoro mio?
---
A beat.
---
## PAOLA:
You make miracle.
---
## DAVIDE:
No.
---
## PAOLA:
_You_ make miracle to survive. No God. You make miracle to love me. For make hundred babies.
---
Paola takes Davide's face in her hands.
---
## PAOLA:
You are best person I ever know, Davide.
---
She holds him.
---
## DAVIDE:
Mi sento così.../
---
(_I feel so..._)
---
## PAOLA:
Lo so.
---
(_I know_.)
---
A long beat.
---
## PAOLA:
We no need to tell. We tell nice story.
---
To be more better for Piccolo Yosef.
---
## DAVIDE:
And piccola Valeria.
---
## PAOLA:
Sì. For when we have hundred babies.
---
## DAVIDE:
Sì.
---
A beat.
---
## DAVIDE:
So where we start?
---
## PAOLA:
Tell me your favorite part of Seder.
---
## DAVIDE:
Il petto di manzo.
---
(_The brisket._)
---
## PAOLA:
No, favorite prayer part.
---
## DAVIDE:
Paola.
---
## PAOLA:
I do good. Let me do good.
---
## DAVIDE:
Il Dayeinu.
---
## PAOLA:
Il Dayeinu?
---
## DAVIDE:
Yes.
---
## PAOLA:
We sing Dayeinu and den we make our bones strong.
---
## DAVIDE:
Ok.
---
Davide turns to the page with 'Dayeinu' in their Haggadot. Paola takes her napkin and wipes off her sweat. She takes the Haggadah and starts fanning herself.
---
## DAVIDE:
(singing)
---
Ilu hotzi, hotzianu
---
Hotzianu mimi-
---
(he stops)
---
Just take off your clothes, gioia.
---
## PAOLA:
Davide!
---
## DAVIDE:
What? Is just us.
---
## PAOLA:

---
## DAVIDE:
Who?
---
## PAOLA:
I don't know. I vicini o...
---
(_The neighbors, or..._.)
---
## DAVIDE:
Paola, we're free!
---
## PAOLA:
Three months in America and you're already a nudista. A "beatnik."
---
## DAVIDE:
Come on!
---
## PAOLA:
Only if you take off your clothes.
---
## DAVIDE:
OK.
---
## PAOLA:
OK?
---
## DAVIDE:
We're free!
---
On count of three.
---
Davide and ## PAOLA:
One....two... three!
---
They both quickly strip off their clothes, so they're only wearing undergarments.
---
## PAOLA:
Ahhh!
---
## DAVIDE:
Look at my sexy American wife!
---
## PAOLA:
No!
---
Davide takes Paola's hands and claps them in rhythm to the song.
---
## DAVIDE:
(singing)
---
Ilu hotzi, hotzianu
---
Hotzianu mimitzrayim,
---
Hotzianu mimitzrayim Dayeinu!
---
From faraway: the sound of a timbrel.
---
Davide stands up, grabs Paola's hand, and starts twirling her around. They dance semi-naked and free as they sing the Dayeinu.
---
Davide and ## PAOLA:
(singing)
---
Day, day-einu! Day, day-einu
---
Day, day-einu, Dayeinu Dayeinu!
---
Ilu natan, natan lanu,
---
natan lanu et hashabbat,
---
natan lanu et hashabbat Dayeinu!
---
Day, day-einu! Day, day-einu

---
They kiss.
---
## PAOLA:
Oy.
---
## DAVIDE:

---
## PAOLA:
You think you good dancer.
---
## DAVIDE:
I took dance class. Arthur Murray.
---
"Arthur Murray taught me dancing in a hurry."
---
## PAOLA:
It was much too much in a hurry.
---
A beat.
---
## PAOLA:
I hear "Dayeinu, die, die" I think die.
---
## DAVIDE:
Is different in Hebrew.
---
## PAOLA:
I know is different.
---
A beat.
---
## PAOLA:
You never die, ok?
---
## DAVIDE:
I survive. Survivor, hey?
---
## PAOLA:
No. You never can die.
---
## DAVIDE:
Non fare la noiosa, gioia.
---
(_Don't be morbid, my joy_)
---
## PAOLA:
No. You _never_ can die.
---
Ok?
---
END OF PART TWO.
---
part 3: chag ha-aviv (the festival of spring)
---
The future. 31 years after Part One. Another warm evening in April. The same house as in Part One. The same Passover table.
---
Projection: April 2050, 15th of Nissan 5810. Los Angeles, California.
---
Dev (54), Yael (50) and Valeria (88) sit around the table. Dev and Yael pick at their mostly empty plates of food. Dev wears a Kippa. Valeria is in a wheelchair. She no longer has the ability to speak. She is hooked up to a thought-to-text machine.
---
Anytime Valeria grunts or responds to the conversation in any way, the translation of her responses should be subtitled for the audience.
---
## DEV:
Hineni, Here I am, ready to perform the Levi Family tradition of recreating the story of the Exodus from Egypt. As it says in the Haggadah, "let all who are hungry, come and eat. Let all who are in need, come and share the Pesach meal." So, as our Nonno did in Auschwitz for Judel, we too shall share our food with those in need.
---
## YAEL:
Amen.
---
Yael and Dev take all of the leftover food and ritualistically put it into to-go boxes.
---
## YAEL:
Can I save some for the girls?
---
## DEV:
Yaya. It's for the elderly who became homeless when the Hebrew Homes were shut / down
---
## YAEL:
I know, I know.
---
But Maya's going to be so sad she missed her Aunt Dev's cooking. Just a bite?
---
## DEV:
Fine, just a bite.
---
Silence as they finish the ritual.
---
## YAEL:
Oh, I missed this.
---
## DEV:
It's nice to have you back.
---
## YAEL:
Nice to be back, sis.
---
## DEV:
Mom was so excited you were coming this year she insisted I make-
---
Oh shoot. Let me go get it.
---
Dev exits to the kitchen.
---
## YAEL:
What is she getting?
---
Valeria grunts (_You'll have to see._)
---
## YAEL:
Ugh fine.
---
Come ti senti?
---
(_How are you feeling, Ma?_)
---
Valeria gives a thumbs up (_My two girls under the same roof? I couldn't be happier._)
---
Yael takes her mother's hand.
---
## YAEL:
Me too, Ma.
---
Valeria grunts (_She missed you._)
---
## YAEL:
You know I missed her too.
---
Dev re-enters with dessert.
---
## DEV:
Nonna Valeria's Torta di Pasqua.
---
## YAEL:
Oh wow! It looks amazing.
---
Valeria gives a thumbs up (_Yeah, it looks beautiful, hon._).
---
## DEV:
Thanks, Ma.
---
They eat in silence for a bit.
---
## YAEL:
It was a really nice service last week.
---
You did a beautiful job.
---
## DEV:
Thanks.
---
## YAEL:
I'm glad Beit Yisrael is safe again.
---
Dad would have wanted to be buried there.
---
## DEV:
Yeah.
---
## YAEL:
And so many of his old congregants showed up.
---
I thought they'd all left or converted.
---
## DEV:
Yeah, most of them have.
---
## DEV:
...
---
## YAEL:
...
---
## DEV:
I can't believe Zoey starts middle school in the fall.
---
Valeria grunts (_They grow up so fast._)
---
## YAEL:
I know, right?
---
## DEV:
And those boobies!
---
## YAEL:
I know!
---
## DEV:
They're like mini Yael-sized boobies.
---
## YAEL:
I took her bra shopping for the first time last week.
---
## DEV:
Oh my god.
---
## YAEL:
She was mortified.
---
## DEV:
I bet.
---
## YAEL:
Like "Mom, give me your wallet and go outside!"
---
## DEV:
Oof.
---
## YAEL:
I went into the dressing room with her. She threw a fit.
---
And I'm like, you think I'm bad? Imagine doing this with Grandma like Aunt Dev / and I did!
---
Valeria grunts (_I wasn't as bad as your Nonna!)_.
---
## DEV:
Remember? I used to stuff my bras with socks.
---
## YAEL:
And I used to pull them out.
---
## DEV:
At Hebrew school.
---
## YAEL:
Yeah sorry.
---
## DEV:
We'd be learning like the Mi Chamocha or something and everyone would be like "look Jewlan lost her boobies! Jewlan lost her boobies!"
---
## YAEL:
Jewlan?
---
## DEV:
You don't remember?
---
## YAEL:
...
---
## DEV:
That's what everyone at Hebrew school used to call me. Like Mulan. But Jew-Lan.
---
## YAEL:
Oh my gosh, right.
---
A beat. Dev makes a decision.
---
## DEV:
(fake casual)
---
You know, Zoey's gonna need her Aunt Dev for Bat-Mitzvah stuff pretty soon.
---
## YAEL:
Oh Dev, come on/
---
## DEV:
She might go to Catholic school, but she's still Jewish.
---
Valeria grunts (_Of course she is!_)
---
## YAEL:
I know, Ma. But she's still pretty traumatized.
---
I'm still traumatized.
---
## DEV:
It was five years ago.
---
## YAEL:
Wouldn't you be if you picked up your six-year-old daughter from school with a black eye? They called her / a
---
Valeria grunts (_I thought you weren't going to talk about this._)
---
## DEV:
You're right. I'm sorry.
---
A beat.
---
## YAEL:
I did just teach her about the Shoah.
---
## DEV:
Oh?
---
## YAEL:
Yeah, she started studying World War 2 in history class. They kind of skirt around it.
---
## DEV:
Even at Saint Mary's?
---
## YAEL:
Yup.
---
And she must have told Maya because now Maya's afraid to go in the shower.
---
## DEV:
Did that ever happen to you?
---
Valeria grunts (_I used to have to go in the shower with her_.)
---
## YAEL:
Oh my gosh, right.
---
## DEV:
My first memory is being in the gas chambers.
---
## YAEL:
What?
---
## DEV:
Yeah. I mean, obviously not. But, like, my first memory is of a series of recurring nightmares I had when I was little where I was in Auschwitz.
---
## YAEL:
Wait. Oh my gosh me too. I used to have Holocaust dreams all the time.
---
## DEV:
Seriously?
---
## YAEL:
Yeah. There's this one where I was in the shower room and gas started coming out, and I tried to scream and nothing came out of my mouth.
---
## DEV:
I had this one once, I think I was maybe 11 or 12 or something, where you and I had to dig Nonno's grave. Like the Nazis were yelling at us, and we had to dig his grave to shoot him into.
---
Valeria grunts (_Non fatte le noiose, girls!_).
---
## YAEL:
Did you ever have the one where you're running over the Italian border, and you / trip?
---
## DEV:
Trip? OhmygodYES.
---
## YAEL:
Sometimes they're doing selections. And I lie and tell them I'm someone else. And they take the fake Yael away to the showers.
---
## DEV:
Woah. That's dark, sis.
---
A beat.
---
## DEV:
Did you see? The _last_ Shoah survivor just...
---
## YAEL:
I know.
---
A beat. A long one. This should land.
---
## DEV:
I thought you were such a prick for making Nonna record all her stories, but...
---
## YAEL:
I was kind of a prick.
---
## DEV:
But now you can show them to the girls. Instead of whatever bullshit they're learning at Saint Mary's.
---
## YAEL:
It's better than what they teach in public school. You know, two sides to the Holocaust and two sides to slavery and two sides to like Japanese / internment and
---
## DEV:
Exactly. Thank God you have those recordings.
---
## YAEL:
Yeah, but they're just kids.
---
## DEV:
So were we.
---
## YAEL:
And look how we turned / out ha
---
## DEV:
At least we know where we come from.
---
A knock on the door.
---
## YAEL:
Who is that? Shit!
---
The knocking continues. Yael panics. She quickly and automatically hides the Seder plate and Jewish items, including the screen upon which they were reading their mothers' thoughts.
---
## DEV:
What are you doing?
---
## YAEL:
Oh my god don't be a martyr.
---
## DEV:
I'm not.
---
## YAEL:
So help me!
---
Valeria grunts.
---
## DEV:
We don't need to do this anymore. No one's gonna / raid our
---
## YAEL:
I have two daughters, Dev. You know I can't be found with this / [stuff]
---
## DEV:
Yes, that's clear.
---
More knocking.
---
## YAEL:
You didn't put the Mezuzah back on the door, did you?
---
## DEV:
Of course I did!
---
## YAEL:
Seriously? Even after they ransacked your house?
---
## DEV:
Yes. I should answer. Just [leave it be].
---
Dev exits the room to answer the door. Yael continues to cover up the Jewish items.
---
Valeria grunts.
---
## YAEL:
I'm sure it's nothing. Don't worry.
---
After a moment, Dev returns.
---
## DEV:
Just a package. Mom's meds.
---
## YAEL:
Oh.
---
Yael breathes a sigh of relief.
---
## YAEL:
Sorry. I didn't mean to [freak out]. Habit.
---
Valeria sticks out her tongue and waves it around.
---
## YAEL:
What is she / doing?
---
## DEV:
More?
---
Valeria gives a thumbs up.
---
Dev grabs a can of Diet Coke and feeds it to Valeria through a straw.
---
## YAEL:
Seriously?
---
## DEV:
That's what the tongue means.
---
## YAEL:
Testa dura. It's going to rot / her teeth
---
## DEV:
Really?
---
## YAEL:
You're right. Sorry.
---
Yael feeds the diet coke to Valeria and strokes her hair. Dev wipes Valeria's bib. A tender moment. They calm down.
---
## YAEL:
That brisket was mmm so good. I'm stuffed.
---
## DEV:
I was trying Mom's old recipe. I remember she made it in 2019, you know, before the... It was Nonno and Nonna's last...
---
## YAEL:
Right, I loved that brisket.
---
## DEV:
You didn't eat that brisket.
---
## YAEL:
What? Yes I did.
---
Valeria grunts.
---
## DEV:
Weren't you a vegan or like a pescatarian or something like / that
---
## YAEL:
No I wasn't.
---
## DEV:
Oh. I thought/
---
## YAEL:
No. That was my partner in college. Nate Moore.
---
## DEV:
Oh right. Nate Moore.
---
I didn't like him.
---
## YAEL:
You never liked my partners.
---
## DEV:
Yeah well Miguel, can you blame me?
---
## YAEL:
Well.
---
Valeria grunts.
---
## DEV:
You never liked mine either.
---
## YAEL:
Yes I did. I liked Rachel.
---
## DEV:
Rachel was like seven years ago, Yaya.
---
And she cheated on me.
---
## YAEL:
Oh. I didn't-
---
Sorry.
---
## DEV:
It's fine. It was a long time ago.
---
## YAEL:
Well. Is there someone I should not like now?
---
## DEV:
Nope. No one.
---
Between Mom and the synagogue, it's like...
---
## YAEL:
Yeah.
---
## DEV:
There are 50 new families this year.
---
## YAEL:
Wow. You would think after...
---
## DEV:
I know, but when Temple Sinai and Wilshire Boulevard folded, we got most of their congregants.
---
## YAEL:
It's because you're Head Rabbi.
---
## DEV:
I'm sure that's / not
---
## YAEL:
Nonno would be so proud.
---
## DEV:
You think?
---
Valeria gives a thumbs up.
---
## YAEL:
Yeah.
---
A beat.
---
## DEV:
He would want his great-granddaughter to have a Bat-/ Mitzvah
---
## YAEL:
Seriously? I thought you were gonna drop it.
---
## DEV:
I know, I am.
---
I'm just saying, Zoey and Maya will probably be the only/
---
## YAEL:
Don't say that.
---
You could get off the adoption waitlist soon.
---
## DEV:
Ha!
---
## YAEL:
Stephanie, another doctor at the hospital, she waited for six years.
---
## DEV:
Is Stephanie a Chinese Jewish lesbian Rabbi? I had no idea there was another one!
---
## YAEL:
The ban lifted two years ago.
---
## DEV:
No I know.
---
Anyway, I reserved Zoey a slot. March 2052.
---
## YAEL:
I don't know. We'll see.
---
## DEV:
She needs to have a Bat-Mitzvah, Yaya.
---
Valeria grunts.
---
## YAEL:
You know she can't speak Hebrew.
---
## DEV:
I'll teach her!
---
## YAEL:
I'd need to talk to Miguel.
---
## DEV:
Screw Miguel.
---
## YAEL:
He's scared. After what he's been through, he has a right to be/
---
## DEV:
The synagogue is a fortress. There's a huge wall covered in barbed wire, face recognition security at every entrance, and armed guards and metal detectors lining the Sanctuary and Social Hall.
---
## YAEL:
Exactly! I don't want a 12-year-old having to go through all that just to learn some stupid language.
---
## DEV:
Stupid? Really?
---
## YAEL:
I didn't mean / that
---
## DEV:
Yes you did.
---
Valeria grunts.
---
## YAEL:
Look. It's one thing if you want to have [Jewish] stuff all over _your_ house, but/
---
## DEV:
You can say "Jewish." It's not like Voldemort. It's not a bad word.
---
## YAEL:
Ohmygod that's not what I was/
---
## DEV:
You used to think you were such an activist.
---
## YAEL:
I'm still an/
---
## DEV:
How?
---
## YAEL:
What?
---
## DEV:
Tell me. How are you still an activist?
---
## YAEL:
Do we have to do this right now?
---
## DEV:
I'm just asking.
---
## YAEL:
I'm keeping my children alive. Protecting them is my / activism.
---
## DEV:
You don't hide who you are. That's what being an activist is. You don't disappear.
---
_I_ can't! I can't just... pass. So _you_ are supposed to stand up for/
---
## YAEL:
OK so I'm a bad Jew. Sue me.
---
Valeria grunts.
---
## DEV:
Are you even listening to me? That's not what I was saying. It's not about whether you're a good Jew or a bad / Jew
---
## YAEL:
Yes it is. You're this like super Jew/
---
## DEV:
Oh / come on
---
## YAEL:
You're this super Jew and I'm like this _outsider_. You're in, I'm out. And fine, whatever. / I'm allowed
---
## DEV:
There's literally thousands of years of Judaism in your literal blood.
---
## YAEL:
Don't make this about/
---
## DEV:
You can't call yourself an outsider. You can't.
---
## YAEL:
Ok. Whatever. I'm not an outsider, but I'm not like, like Moses.
---
## DEV:
What?
---
## YAEL:
Leading our people out of shootings and cross burnings and University quotas into some like better world.
---
## DEV:
You think that's what I'm doing?
---
## YAEL:
And that's good. Really. I'm proud of you. But that's not the life I chose.
---
## DEV:
I'm just trying to give hope, like help people _survive_ this, so that their children don't have to freak out whenever there's a knock on the door. So they can have a Bat-Mitzvah.
---
Valeria grunts.
---
## YAEL:
You sound like Dad: "today I helped bring people closer to God, Yael, what did _you_ do with your day?"
---
## DEV:
Don't make this about/
---
## YAEL:
I'm just saying like being super Jew always came first, before Mom, before us, and this was before he ran off with what's-her-name, president of the sisterhood/
---
## DEV:
So you're abandoning your people because our father left us?
---
## YAEL:
Don't exaggerate! I am NOT "abandoning" / our
---
## DEV:
Even Mom started to daven again after she lost her job.
---
Valeria grunts.
---
## YAEL:
And whose fault is that?
---
## DEV:
What are you saying?
---
## YAEL:
You don't think your "activism" is the reason she was fired?
---
## DEV:
They fired Jewish professors all over the country, Yaya.
---
## YAEL:
Ok. Then what about my daughter?
---
## DEV:
I thought we weren't going to get into this.
---
## YAEL:
I just... you haven't changed. Even after you put Zoey in danger/
---
## DEV:
I would _never_ put my niece in / danger
---
## YAEL:
They knew she was Jewish because of the picture of the two of you online. You know that.
---
And I thought after all these years, you would have understood.
---
## DEV:
I do understand! I told you a million times. I understand why you were scared. That's human. I said I wouldn't be with the girls in public anymore.
---
## YAEL:
That's not / what I was
---
## DEV:
I wasn't the one that cut off all communication after that, Yaya. You did the same thing with Dad. When things get tough, you just BAM, shut people out of your life.
---
## YAEL:
To protect my family!
---
## DEV:
Oh come on. I'm not the bad guy here.
---
## YAEL:
No. Just the martyr.
---
Valeria grunts.
---
## DEV:
In Auschwitz, Nonno gave his food to the younger boys.
---
It's the least we can do.
---
## YAEL:
I'm not Nonno! I can't be Nonno!
---
## DEV:
But you can. That's what I'm saying! It's a choice.
---
## YAEL:
I have kids, Dev. I don't get a choice.
---
## DEV:
Yes you do.
---
## YAEL:
What would you / know about
---
## DEV:
I choose to put on this Kippah, Yaya, when I walk outside. But even if I didn't, everyone still sees-
---
(she motions at herself)
---
I don't get a choice.
---
## YAEL:
You're right. / I'm sorry. That's not what
---
## DEV:
And you don't have to think twice about holding your partner's hand in public. I do. I have to. But I still choose to do it. And I still choose to put on a Kippah. Because this is who I am.
---
## YAEL:
You're a better person than me, ok? Is that what you want me to say?
---
## DEV:
No! I just want / you to
---
## YAEL:
Stop. Can we please just.
---
The girls were so happy we were talking again. Mom was so happy we were talking again.
---
## DEV:
So am I!
---
## YAEL:
Really?
---
## DEV:
Of course!
---
## YAEL:
Because we're together again or because I'm the one taking Mom to the hospital so you can go off and lead another synagogue vigil?
---
## DEV:
That is so unfair.
---
You only started talking to me again when Mom got sick.
---
Valeria grunts.
---
## DEV:
And those vigils are important. Our community needs healing.
---
## YAEL:
I know, that's not / what I was-
---
## DEV:
Most of our people either moved to Israel or
---
(indicating Yael)
---
Erased any semblance of who they are.
---
## YAEL:
/ Seriously?
---
Valeria grunts.
---
## DEV:
We have to survive this somehow.
---
## YAEL:
Stop. Just stop, please.
---
## DEV:
And things are finally getting back to normal. Your children have a real chance to grow up with all the joyful parts of Judaism, without fear / and hate
---
## YAEL:
I'm their mother! You're not their...
---
You could have kids and raise them your own way.
---
## DEV:
Well I'm not going to.
---
## YAEL:
What?
---
## DEV:
I took my name off the adoption list.
---
Valeria grunts.
---
## YAEL:
Wait what?
---
## DEV:
Yeah. A few weeks ago.
---
At Dad's funeral, I was just like thinking about our life growing up, how much he missed, and/
---
## YAEL:
You wouldn't be like him/
---
## DEV:
You don't know that. Plus all the death threats, it was just too...
---
## YAEL:
Oh Dev.
---
## DEV:
But now you have a responsibility to raise your children/
---
## YAEL:
I'm sorry Dev, but you can't use my children as if they're the last hope of the Jewish people, that's completely / and ridiculously out of line!
---
## DEV:
But _you_ have to face reality, Yaya! You can't just la di da hide your head under the sand and hope / that
---
Valeria bangs her hands on the table in anger.
---
Everyone shuts up. Silence.
---
Valeria grunts again.
---
## YAEL:
Shoot, we didn't check Ma's thingy. The thought-to-text / thingy.
---
## DEV:
Where's the screen? I thought it was right here.
---
## YAEL:
Oh God, I think I hid it with the Seder stuff.
---
Yael takes back out the screen with the though-to-text app.
---
## YAEL:
Sorry, Ma. We didn't see.
---
Here, we can look. What did you say?
---
They look at the screen. We see all of what Valeria was trying to communicate:
---
"I want the Diet Coke."
---
"Miguel è un bastardo."
---
"Rachel è una bastarda."
---
"Girls!"
---
"Girls, please!"
---
"Seriously, stop!"
---
"Oh, don't drag me into this!"
---
"Girls, please, stop it."
---
"Seriously, girls, enough."
---
Next slide:
---
"Pretty soon, it will just be you girls. That's it. You have to take care of each other. Please take care of each other."
---
A long, long silence.
---
## DEV:
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to/
---
## YAEL:
No. Me too. You know I....
---
## DEV:
I know.
---
## YAEL:
I don't want to go another five years without...
---
## DEV:
Me neither. Really.
---
A long beat.
---
## DEV:
Should we finish the Seder?
---
## YAEL:
Dev, it's getting late and/
---
Valeria grunts (_Please. I want to finish._)
---
## YAEL:
Ok, Ma. Let's do it. What's left?
---
## DEV:
Elijah. I'll get the door.
---
Dev gets up to the open the front door. She looks outside just to make sure no one's listening.
---
## YAEL:
(holding up Elijah's cup)
---
Remember Nonno used to sneakily drink the cup of wine and then say, "Guess Elijah was thirsty?"
---
Valeria grunts and gives a thumbs up (_Yes! That was my favorite part of the Seder._)
---
Dev returns to the table.
---
## DEV:
Ready?
---
Yael nods, but doesn't sing along. Valeria bobs her head along and the lyrics to the prayer float up on the screen.
---
## DEV:
(singing)
---
Eliyahu ha-navee
---
Eliyahu ha-Tish-bee
---
Eliyahu Eliyahu Eliyahu ha-Giladee
---
Beem-hei-ra b'ya-mei-nu
---
Yavo ei-leinu
---
Eem ma-shee-ach ben David
---
Eem ma-shee-ach ben David
---
Eliyahu ha-navee
---
Eliyahu ha-Tish-bee
---
Eliyahu Eliyahu Eliyahu ha-Giladee
---
Valeria gives a thumbs up (_Thank you._)
---
## YAEL:
Yeah, that was beautiful sis. Ok, I should really get going.
---
## DEV:
Give the girls a big kiss from me.
---
## YAEL:
I will.
---
## DEV:
I wanted to let you know. I'm leading a mission trip to Auschwitz next Spring.
---
## YAEL:
Oh. Wow.
---
## DEV:
Yeah, it's the first trip to the Camps since the travel ban was lifted.
---
If you want, you should bring the girls.
---
## YAEL:
I'll think about it.
---
## DEV:
This isn't me pushing. But for Maya and Zoey/
---
## YAEL:
Please, Dev.
---
## DEV:
It's dangerous, not knowing where your family comes from.
---
## YAEL:
Dev, it's not the/
---
## DEV:
No I know.
---
But for your kids, for me, not knowing...
---
I'm not saying it's worse than shootings and all this, but... I think it's a kind of trauma too.
---
A beat.
---
## YAEL:
When we were in China that summer and we went to the orphanage where you... you said it felt like a a dream. Like you got there and you were expecting it to, I don't know... but it didn't feel like home.
---
## DEV:
I was angry. I was 23 years old!
---
## YAEL:
Saying these prayers tonight, like Mah Nishtana, Eliyahu...
---
it's like I know all the words, they're so engrained-
---
But it's just a foreign language.
---
## DEV:
Our people survived horrible, horrible things to be able to say those words.
---
## YAEL:
You sound like Nonna.
---
## DEV:
Well we did.
---
A beat.
---
## YAEL:
I'll think about the trip. I will.
---
Love you, Ma. I'll see you tomorrow.
---
Yael kisses Valeria on the cheek.
---
## YAEL:
I didn't think we would have to go through this again.
---
## DEV:
È la vita.
---
## YAEL:
It's nice Nonno and Nonna went together, you know? Just hours apart. I keep thinking about Mom...
---
## DEV:
Yeah. I know.
---
## YAEL:
It just seems like every time we get a second to breathe...
---
## DEV:
It's when we're the most tired that God does her work.
---
## YAEL:
No 'Rabbi Dev', / please.
---
## DEV:
I'm not trying to go all 'sermon' on you.
---
But there were flowers in the desert!
---
It's when we're the most tired, just getting through to the next day, just surviving, that we can see the miracle.
---
I'm trying to make a miracle.
---
## YAEL:
(Yael points to Valeria)
---
What's the miracle in this?
---
I'm trying to turn off my science brain.
---
But tell me.
---
What's the miracle in this, Dev?
---
A beat.
---
## DEV:
I don't know yet.
---
Valeria grunts (You _are the miracle. You are my miracles._)
---
Yael hugs Dev.
---
## DEV:
Hey sis. L'shanah ha-ba-ah bee-Yeru-sha-layim.
---
Next year in Jerusalem.
---
## YAEL:
Next year in Jerusalem.
---
Yael exits. Dev goes to clean up the table. She sees that somehow (magically?) Elijah's cup of wine is empty.
---
From faraway: the sound of a timbrel.
---
Dev holds the cup up to the light. Valeria smiles.
---
END OF PART THREE.
---
part 4: chag ha-pesach (the festival of passover)
---
Hundreds or thousands or tens of thousands of years ago. 40 years since the Exodus. Maybe 1406 BCE?
---
The stage explodes. We're suddenly in the desert of Sinai. We're in a sacred time, a Biblical time. A time of miracles.
---
Another warm evening in April. Another Passover Seder.
---
Projection: April ~1406 BCE, 15th of Nissan ~2344. 40 years since the Exodus. Sinai Desert.
---
A group of Israelites [Paola, Davide, Valeria, Dev, and Yael] sit on the floor in the desert of Sinai.
---
Though they share the same names and the resemblance is uncanny, Paola, Davide, Valeria, Dev, and Yael are not themselves in the present. They are Israelites in the Sinai Desert. Paola and Davide speak in unaccented English.
---
(This scene is spoken in English, but it's really in Hebrew. Hebrew subtitles should be shown. Some of the text in this scene is taken directly from the Torah.)
---
Manna falls from the sky. Dev gathers it in a basket.
---
## DEV:
Hineni. Here I am.
---
Dev enters the tent, carrying a basket of Manna.
---
## YAEL:
Finally! I'm so hungry.
---
## DEV:
You're always hungry.
---
## YAEL:
You're always / mean.
---
## DAVIDE:
Girls, please! Be nice to each other.
---
## YAEL:
Sorry.
---
## DEV:
Sorry, Saba.
---
Valeria gives everyone a portion of Manna.
---
## VALERIA:
B'tay-a-vone.
---
They begin eating.
---
## YAEL:
Ughhh I'm so sick of Manna.
---
## PAOLA:
Well, it's your last night.
---
## YAEL:
Yes!
---
(chanting)
---
Last night of Manna!
---
Yael and ## DEV:
(chanting)
---
Last night of Manna! Last night of Manna!
---
Davide takes Paola's hand.
---
## DEV:
What's wrong, Safta?
---
## PAOLA:
Nothing, my joy.
---
## YAEL:
What kind of food will there be in the Promised Land?
---
## DAVIDE:
Oh, watermelon and pomegranates and grapes and olives and milk and honey. Up to your ears!
---
## YAEL:
What does watermelon taste like?
---
## DAVIDE:
Like dancing naked on a hot day.
---
## PAOLA:
/ Ooh!
---
## YAEL:
What does dancing naked on a hot day taste like?
---
## DAVIDE:
Like the memory of a memory.
---
## DEV:
I can't believe we're going to be in Jerusalem tomorrow.
---
## VALERIA:
Probably not tomorrow, hon. It might take a little while for Joshua and the army to get through Jericho.
---
## DEV:
Fine, well then by next year.
---
## YAEL:
Next year in Jerusalem!
---
## DEV:
Next year in Jerusalem!
---
Davide takes Paola's hand.
---
## DEV:
Is it true the people are the size of giants?
---
## YAEL:
Giants?
---
## DEV:
Joshua said we're grasshoppers compared to them!
---
## PAOLA:
Oh, Joshua's handsome.
---
## DAVIDE:
And a Rabbi!
---
## VALERIA:
Abba! Joshua's too old for / her.
---
## YAEL:
I want to marry Moses' son.
---
## PAOLA:
Moses' son? You should marry a Jew.
---
## DEV:
He is Jewish!
---
## PAOLA:
His mother is a Midianite.
---
## VALERIA:
Eema!
---
## PAOLA:
What? She is. Tzipporah. What kind of a goyischa name / is that?
---
## DEV:
Safta, Shhhhhhh. You'll get leprosy. Like God gave Miriam.
---
## PAOLA:
It's ok. God doesn't listen to me anyway.
---
## DEV:
God listens to everyone.
---
## PAOLA:
Oh, to be young and forgetful.
---
## YAEL:
What's the first thing you're going to do in Canaan, Safta?
---
A beat.
---
Paola looks at Valeria and Davide.
---
## DEV:
What's going on?
---
## PAOLA:
Nothing, my treasures.
---
## DEV:
Then what's the first thing you're going to do in Canaan?
---
No response.
---
## DEV:
See? What's going / on?
---
## VALERIA:
We have to tell them.
---
## PAOLA:
Valeria!
---
## YAEL:
Tell us what?
---
## DEV:
You're coming with us, right?
---
A beat.
---
## DAVIDE:
No, carina. We're not.
---
## YAEL:
What? You have to come!
---
## DEV:
Yes, we won't go without you!
---
Paola and Davide speak once again in their accents. The accents should start out light and grow heavier as the scene progresses.
---
## DAVIDE:
Even if we could, gioia, we're not allowed. Neither is Moses.
---
## DEV:
Why?
---
## PAOLA:
We were born in Egypt. Freedom is for the young, not the old.
---
## YAEL:
What do you mean? We're free now.
---
## PAOLA:
We're wandering, that's not free.
---
## YAEL:
I don't understand.
---
## PAOLA:
Do we look like we can fight off the Amalekites? The Hittites? The Jebusites? The Amorites? The Giants?
---
## YAEL:
But don't you want to have a watermelon, Nonno?
---
## DAVIDE:
I have de memory. Dayeinu.
---
## YAEL:
Mom, you have to talk to them.
---
Valeria looks at her parents.
---
## YAEL:
What?
---
## VALERIA:
I was born in Egypt too.
---
I can't come to the Promised Land either.
---
## DEV:
What? No! You have to come!
---
## YAEL:
Yes, we'll sneak you in!
---
## VALERIA:
Hon, I can't. You don't think I want to watch you girls grow up? Of course I do. More than...
---
But I can't.
---
## YAEL:
But it's not fair!
---
## VALERIA:
Sometimes people leave you, hon. And it's not fair. Sometimes it's just about making it through the day, getting out of bed.
---
## YAEL:
But I want to stay with you! I don't want to go anymore.
---
## VALERIA:
Yael/
---
## YAEL:
What? We're probably not going to make it there anyway.
---
## PAOLA:
Non fare la noiosa/

## YAEL:
And even if we do, the Amalekites don't want us. They'll kill us off or burn down our houses or fire us from our jobs or give our children black eyes / or
---
## DEV:
But Yaya, we have to try.
---
## YAEL:
Why?
---
## DEV:
Where else are we going to go?
---
Valeria wraps her daughters in a hug.
---
## VALERIA:
You're ready. You don't need us to take care of you anymore.
---
## YAEL:
At least we won't be alone.
---
## VALERIA:
That's right. It's time for you to take care of each other.
---
Please take care of each other.
---
A beat.
---
## YAEL:
What are we supposed to do?
---
## DAVIDE:
You tell the story of how we got here. You remember.
---
So when you are free, you can tell your children and your children's children and deir children. So dey will remember de story. So dey will remember us. Dat's how you keep going, gioia.
---
## DEV:
(taking her sister's hand)
---
Then tell us the story. From the beginning.
---
## PAOLA:
Ok.
---
Well as you know, we were slaves in Egypt for a long time. It was a hard, bitter life.
---
Dev pulls Maror out of the sand.
---
## VALERIA:
What's that?
---
## DEV:
Maror. So we can remember the bitterness of slavery.
---
Dev draws a circle in the sand (the shape of a Seder plate) and places the Maror on the Seder Plate.
---
## YAEL:
What are you doing?
---
## DEV:
I'm trying to make a miracle.
---
What happened next?
---
## PAOLA:
Well, one day, after Moses talked to God at de burning bush/
---
## DEV:
(I want to talk to God.)
---
## DAVIDE:
Ah, la nostra piccola Rabbina!
---
## PAOLA:
So Moses saw bush burning/
---
## DAVIDE:
Wait. We have to tell dem about de boy we lost. Before we got here. Before Valeria.
---
## PAOLA:
Davide/
---
## DAVIDE:
We need to tell all parts, gioia. Good and bad.
---
(back to the story)
---
Pharaoh told all of us we had to kill de baby boys. Throw dem in the Nile.
---
## PAOLA:
Doctor say he no have chance.
---
Davide takes Paola's hand.
---
## VALERIA:
But after a long time, Moses came back to Egypt to save us. And he said to Pharaoh: Let my people go! But Pharaoh said no.
---
## PAOLA:
So God brought down de ten plagues.
---
Paola, davide, and ## VALERIA:
Blood, frogs, / lice
---
yael and ## DEV:
Lice. We know.
---
Valeria opens a can of diet coke and drinks it from a straw.
---
## PAOLA:
De final plague was de Death of the firstborn.
---
## DAVIDE:
We sacrificed a lamb and took de blood to put on our doors.
---
Dev pulls a shankbone out of the sand and places it on the Seder plate.
---
## DAVIDE:
So dat God would not kill us. Only kill de oders. And Pharaoh's son Judel died.
---
## DEV:
Judel?
---
## PAOLA:
It was Ramses, tesoro mio.
---
## DAVIDE:
Oh, right. Ramses.
---
## YAEL:
Who was Judel?
---
## PAOLA:
Is ok. You no need to tell, gioia. We make nice story.
---
## DAVIDE:
No. Dey need to know. Is only way to be free.
---
Davide pulls an egg out of the sand and places it on the Seder plate.
---
## DAVIDE:
For Judel. May his memory be a blessing.
---
They all look at Davide. Recognition.
---
## DEV:
What happened next?
---
## VALERIA:
After the tenth plague, Pharaoh told us we could finally leave. But quickly!
---
## YAEL:
Wait. I want to record this. One sec. So we can remember.
---
Yael takes out some kind of modern anachronistic voice recording device (the one we saw her use in Part One). She starts recording.
---
## PAOLA:
We gathered all of our stuff in a hurry and den we hurried down to de Sea. We didn't even have enough time for our bread to rise. So we took it as it was.
---
## DEV:
Matzah!
---
Dev pulls a piece of Matzah out of the sand and places it on the Seder plate.
---
## PAOLA:
Esattamente.
---
Now at dis point, Pharaoh had change of heart. Il bastardo. So an army of Germans-
---
## YAEL:
Egyptians, Nonna.
---
## PAOLA:
Right, Egyptians.
---
Dey followed us down to de water. We no know what to do. But your Nonno was brave man, he starts walking into de water.
---
## DAVIDE:
No, no brave.
---
## PAOLA:
Yes brave, gioia.
---
You are best person I ever know, Davide.
---
## DAVIDE:
Tesoro mio.
---
## PAOLA:
Sempre e per sempre.
---
So de water came up to his ankles, den his knees, den his waist, his chest, his neck. Finally, his head. And at de very moment when he was about to drown, de seas split. And we walked right through.
---
And de seas closed and de Egyptians drowned behind us.
---
And den Miriam starts singing.
---
And dancing with a timbrel.
---
And we all join her.
---
All de women.
---
Singing and crying and dancing.
---
Your Mama on my back.
---
(singing)
---
Mi Chamocha-
---
Paola tries to sing, but it's too hard.
---
## DEV:
I can do it, Nonna. It's our turn.
---
(singing)

Mi Chamocha Ba'elim Adonai

Nora t'hilot/
---
Yael joins in.
---
## DEV & YAEL:
Oseh feleh?
 Nora t'hilot, oseh feleh?
---
~
---
We break in reality. The Levi-Katz family starts singing and dancing with timbrels, which have now appeared.
---
It is the past and the present and the future.
---
Slowly, over the course of the song and dance, flowers start blooming everywhere - seemingly out of thin air. They're cherry blossoms.
---

Mi Chamocha Ba'elim Adonai
