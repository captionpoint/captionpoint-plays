## Customization (Optional!)

Want to customize the look? Create a `template` folder in your workspace:

```
my-presentations/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ template/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ style.scss       # Your custom styles
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html       # Your custom template
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ remark.min.js    # Local remark.js (optional)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ my-slides.md
```

If no `template` folder exists, the extension uses beautiful default styles automatically!

## Common Questions

### Q: Do I need to install anything else?

**A:** Nope! Just install the extension and start writing markdown.

### Q: Where are my presentations saved?

**A:** They're just `.md` files in your folder. You can edit them in any text editor!

### Q: Can I export to PDF?

**A:** Yes! During presentation, press `P` for presenter mode, then use your browser's "Print to PDF" feature.

### Q: Can I use images?

**A:** Yes! Just use markdown image syntax: `![Description](path/to/image.jpg)`

### Q: The preview isn't updating

**A:** Make sure you've saved the file (`Cmd+S` / `Ctrl+S`)

### Q: Can I share my presentation?

**A:** Yes! You can:
1. Share the `.md` file (others need this extension)
2. Export to PDF (works anywhere)
3. Export to HTML (advanced - see documentation)

## Tips for Better Presentations

1. **Keep it simple** - One main idea per slide
2. **Use big fonts** - Headings show up well
3. **Images speak** - A picture is worth 1000 words
4. **Practice** - Use presenter mode (`P` key) to rehearse
5. **Less text** - Bullet points, not paragraphs
