# Distribution Guide - Packaging for Others

## Prerequisites

Install the VS Code Extension packaging tool:

```bash
npm install -g @vscode/vsce
```

## Step 1: Prepare for Packaging

Make sure everything is compiled and ready:

```bash
cd vscode-extension
npm install
npm run compile
```

## Step 2: Package the Extension

Create a `.vsix` file that can be shared:

```bash
vsce package
```

This creates a file like: `remark-preview-0.1.0.vsix`

## Step 3: Test the Package

Before sharing, test it yourself:

1. Open VS Code
2. Go to Extensions (`Cmd+Shift+X` / `Ctrl+Shift+X`)
3. Click the `...` menu â†’ "Install from VSIX..."
4. Select your `.vsix` file
5. Test it with a simple markdown file

## Step 4: Distribute to Users

### Option A: Direct File Sharing

1. Share the `.vsix` file directly (email, Dropbox, etc.)
2. Provide these installation instructions:

**Installation Instructions for Recipients:**

```
1. Download the remark-preview-X.X.X.vsix file
2. Open Visual Studio Code
3. Click Extensions icon in sidebar (or Cmd+Shift+X / Ctrl+Shift+X)
4. Click the "..." menu at the top
5. Select "Install from VSIX..."
6. Choose the downloaded .vsix file
7. Click "Reload" when prompted
8. Done! Open any .md file and press Cmd+Shift+V (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+V (Windows)
```

### Option B: GitHub Release

1. Create a GitHub repository
2. Create a release
3. Upload the `.vsix` file as a release asset
4. Share the release URL

### Option C: VS Code Marketplace (Public Distribution)

For wider distribution:

1. Create a publisher account at https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage
2. Get a Personal Access Token from Azure DevOps
3. Publish:

```bash
vsce publish
```

**Note:** This makes it available to everyone via VS Code's built-in extension marketplace.

## What to Include in Your Distribution

### Minimum Package Contents

The `.vsix` file includes everything needed:
- Compiled extension code
- Default templates and styles

### Recommended Additional Files

When sharing, also provide:

1. **USER_GUIDE.md** - For beginners
2. **Example markdown file** - `example-presentation.md`
3. **Quick start PDF** - One-page instructions

## Creating a Distribution Package

Create a folder to share:

## Version Updates

When you release a new version:

1. Update version in `package.json`:
   ```json
   "version": "0.2.0"
   ```

2. Recompile and repackage:
   ```bash
   npm run compile
   vsce package
   ```

3. The new `.vsix` file will have the updated version number

## Troubleshooting Common Packaging Issues

### "Missing publisher name"

Add to `package.json`:
```json
"publisher": "your-name"
```

### "Missing repository"

Add to `package.json`:
```json
"repository": {
  "type": "git",
  "url": "https://github.com/yourusername/remark-preview"
}
```

### Large package size

Check what's included:
```bash
vsce ls
```

Exclude unnecessary files in `.vscodeignore`

### Dependencies not included

Make sure to run:
```bash
npm install --production
```

Before packaging.

## For Advanced Users: Custom Templates

If you want to share a version with specific templates pre-configured:

1. Add your template files to `resources/`:
   ```
   resources/
   â”œâ”€â”€ default-template.html
   â”œâ”€â”€ default-style.css
   â””â”€â”€ custom-theme/
       â”œâ”€â”€ style.scss
       â””â”€â”€ fonts/
   ```

2. Modify the preview provider to use your templates

3. Package with your custom templates included
